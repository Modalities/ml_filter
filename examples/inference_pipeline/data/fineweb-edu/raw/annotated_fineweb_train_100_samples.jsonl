{"id": "2", "text": "As fun as craps can get, to truly enjoy the game and avoid any potential faux pas, it’s important to understand the craps etiquette at the table.\nIn this guide I will walk you through the do’s and don’ts of craps etiquette.\nLet’s get started!\n1. Never Hand Cash to the Dealer\nIn a game of craps, it’s important to remember that you should never hand cash directly to the dealer.\nThis isn’t a personal slight, but rather a standard casino rule.\nIf you want to buy-in, wait for a pause between rolls, place your cash on the table, make eye contact with the dealer, and say, “Change, please.”\n2. Keep the Dice Visible\nWhen you’re the shooter (the person rolling the dice), always keep the dice visible. Don’t remove them from the table or hide them from the dealer.\nThis is to ensure fair play and maintain the integrity of the game.\n3. Don’t Buy-in During a Roll\nNever attempt to buy-in or exchange cash for chips when the shooter has the dice. Wait for the dealer to indicate when it’s okay to place bets and when you should not.\nIf you’re playing, ensure the dealer confirms any bet you’re trying to place before the shooter rolls the dice.\n4. Respect the Pace of the Game\nAs the shooter, you control the pace of the game. When it’s your turn, just shoot the dice. Avoid unnecessary delays, such as blowing on the dice, which can also spread germs.\nIf you don’t feel like shooting, you can always “pass right” and let the next player take their turn.\n5. Passing Right\nIf you don’t want to shoot, it’s perfectly acceptable to pass the dice to the player on your right.\nTo do this, open your hand with the dice in your palm and indicate them towards the next player in a clockwise manner.\n6. Hands High\nWhen the dealer says, “Hands high” or “the dice are out”, lift your hands off the table.\nThis ensures you’re not interfering with the play and the dice can be passed to the shooter without obstruction.\n7. Be Respectful to Other Players\nGood manners are essential at the craps table.\nAvoid hanging your hands over the edge of the rail or resting drinks on the rail. Excessive drinking can lead to disruptive behavior, so it’s best to drink responsibly.\nKeep the table clean and free from drinks and cigarette ashes.\n8. Ask the Dealer for Help\nIf you’re unsure about the different bets or any aspect of the game, feel free to ask the dealer for help. However, don’t rely on the dealer to coach you throughout the game.\nThe craps table can get crowded, and dealers need to focus on managing the game.\n9. Don’t Forget to Tip\nTipping the dealer is a common courtesy, regardless of whether you win or lose. Never hand a dealer money directly.\nInstead, place money or chips on the table for tipping purposes and clearly state what the money is for. You can also place a bet for your dealer as a tip.\nCraps is an exciting and engaging game that brings together people from all walks of life.\nUnderstanding and practicing proper craps etiquette not only enhances your gaming experience but also contributes to a friendly and respectful atmosphere at the table.\nRemember, the goal is to have fun and enjoy the game.\nBy following these craps etiquette guidelines, you’ll be able to participate in the game smoothly, make new friends, and create memorable experiences.\nSo, whether you’re a seasoned player or a newbie, step up to the craps table with confidence and respect, and let the good times roll!", "scores": {"score": 1}}

The Spaniard's rookie McLaren teammate, Lewis Hamilton, completed his impressive debut weekend with a podium.\nHamilton was one of the stars of a race that saw most of the action take place behind the leaders. The Briton, fourth on the grid, jumped to third at the start as Alonso was forced to back off and dropped to P4 while fighting with Nick Heidfeld's BMW for second place.\nAt the end of trouble-free first lap - Anthony Davidson's Super Aguri seemed to stall at the start, but the former Honda tester was able to continue -Raikkonen already led Heidfeld by 1.2sec, with Hamilton, Alonso, Robert Kubica in the second BMW, Renault's Giancarlo Fisichella, Red Bull's Mark Webber and Toyota's Ralf Schumacher rounding out the top-eight.\nRaikkonen's teammate Felipe Massa gained four spots at the start, moving up to 18th. The Brazilian had started last, after qualifying 16th due to gearbox problems, then losing 10 grid spots with an engine-change penalty.\nDespite being on hard tires versus Heidfeld's soft compound - as a novelty in the 2007 regulations, drivers are obligated to use both tire variations during the race - Raikkonen had no trouble in pulling away from the German in a rate of over half a second per lap. By the time Heidfeld kicked off the first round of pitstops for the frontrunners, on lap 14, he trailed Raikkonen by over eight seconds.\nBefore that, however, Christijan Albers had the dubious honor of being the first driver to retire in the 2007 season, and in a bizarre manner. The Dutch driver missed a braking zone inexplicably, crashing his Spyker against the tire barriers. Afterwards, Albers admitted he got distracted while adjusting the car's radio.\nMeanwhile Massa's recovery drive came to a halt when he reached the 16th spot and the Hondas of Jenson Button and Rubens Barrichello. The Briton, with a heavy fuel load, slowed down both Brazilians for eight laps before being overtaken by Barrichello on lap 14 and by Massa two laps later.\nCatch up on the latest Formula 1 developments each month in RACER. Check out our look at how Kimi Raikkonen settled in at Ferrari over the winter in our April issue, on sale now!\nRaikkonen pitted early, on the 18th lap, giving Hamilton the opportunity to lead five laps on his maiden race. The rookie came in on the 23rd, one lap after teammate Alonso, and the top-three positions remained unchanged. Heidfeld was the biggest loser in the initial round of stops, dropping to fifth, behind teammate Kubica.\nMassa, for his part, didn't pit until the 29th of 58 laps, giving away a one-stop strategy to make up for the lost time. Button's miserable weekend continued in the meantime, with the Honda man being awarded a drive-through penalty for pitlane speeding. On the same lap, American Scott Speed, who ran as high as 17th, had to park his Toro Rosso after an off due to tire problems.\nEight laps later, Kubica's fine run came to an end when he drove his BMW into the garage with gearbox problems, an issue that had plagued the Swiss-German team all through winter testing.\nAnother top-team newbie wasn't having as much of a stellar run: after a couple of brief offs, Renault's Heikki Kovalainen spun but managed to rejoin on lap 41.\nAlso spinning on lap 44, when the second round of pit stops was under way, was local favorite Mark Webber, who managed the feat while entering the pits. The Australian lost time, but was able to continue unscathed. Ditto for Raikkonen, whose tranquil run was spiced up by a small off-road excursion on lap 47.\nThe second round of pits produced the final main change in the order, as Alonso was able to emerge of the boxes ahead of Hamilton to gain P2. From then on, the only piece of headlining action came from a dive-bomb move by Red Bull's David Coulthard on Alex Wurz's Williams on lap 51 in a fight for the 13th spot. The Scot's overly optimistic maneuver on the inside caused both cars to touch wheels, launching DC's RB3, which just barely missed running over Wurz's helmet. Both men retired at the spot.\nSeven laps later, Raikkonen crossed the finish line for his first win since 2005. Heidfeld rallied to finish fourth, ahead of Fisichella, who fended off a last-gasp attack by Massa, the Brazilian's one-stop strategy paying off with a P6 finish. Williams' Nico Rosberg and Ralf Schumacher in the Toyota took the remaining Australian GP points.\n\"It wasn't as easy as it seemed, but we had a plan and followed it,\" Raikkonen said. \"\" We pushed hard on the opening laps and the car was perfect all day long. It's an excellent start to our season.\"\nDespite the defeat, Alonso was upbeat with the eight points hauled from Albert Park: \"We need to work harder if we are to win races, but we made the max out of the circumstances,\" the Spaniard felt. \"I had to focus on Heidfeld at the start and left room for Lewis to go, and that cost us. But it was a good fight.\"\nAn elated Hamilton, the first black driver to achieve the pinnacle of motorsport, celebrated a debut that, a couple of minor offs during the race aside, was nearly impeccable: \"Leading was fantastic, a fantastic feeling really. It was tough to have the champion behind me, but the team did an incredible job getting the car ready in the off-season. I don't know what happened on the second stop, I felt like it was a good stop, but in all it was a great experience.\"\nThe 2007 Formula 1 season resumes in three weeks' time with the Malaysian GP.

{"id": "7", "text": "How to find the right plan to fit your budget\nIt’s always a good idea to have dental insurance. Maintaining good oral health impacts your body’s overall health, so it’s important to know you can regularly access dental health services that are covered by a good insurance plan.\nLike any service or product, though, there are many options to choose from in the marketplace and it can be tricky to know which dental benefits plan is best for you. A good place to start is understanding the basics of dental insurance.\nDetermine your dental care needs\nThe first consideration is to determine your needs. If you are single and younger in age, the best dental plan for you will differ from that of a married couple with several children.\nCost of the dental insurance plan you choose will be determined by the type of plan that is chosen. While premiums for dental insurance are generally lower compared to conventional health insurance, dental plans generally cover 80% of costs on basic procedures such as treating cavities, removing teeth, and root canals. More serious procedures such as crowns and treatment of gum disease may only have 50% of costs covered.\nMost plans do cover 100% of preventative procedures such as teeth cleanings and X-rays.\nThree Types of Dental Insurance Plans\n- Indemnity or fee-for-service plans are generally the most expensive type of coverage. They will offer the largest network of dental providers to choose from and insurers will generally put a cap on the costs they’ll cover for certain procedures. Additionally, it’s not uncommon for the patient to pay the entire cost for a procedure and then file a claim with the insurer, which will provide reimbursement upon approval of the claim.\n- Preferred provider organizations (PPO) are one of the most common types of plans available and feature a network of dentists who negotiate fees with the insurer, resulting in lower out-of-pocket fees for the patient. Patients are able to use a dentist outside of the established network of providers, but there is usually a higher cost.\n- Health maintenance organizations (HMO) are similar to PPOs in that dentists join a network of providers to provide services at reduced costs. However, in an HMO the networks are usually much smaller within a constrained geographic footprint. In some cases, there may be out-of-network services these plans will allow you to access at a reduced cost. While these are generally the cheapest dental insurance plans available, they are also the most limited.\nAccessing dental insurance plans\nMost people have access to dental insurance through their employer, however, insurance can also be secured through group coverage programs that might include the Affordable Care Act Marketplace or government programs such as Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP).\nThe alternative to group coverage plans is purchasing an individual plan, which can be more expensive. These plans can also be more limited in the type of procedures that are covered and there’s sometimes a waiting period of anywhere between a few months to a year before major procedures will be covered.\nWhen considering an individual dental plan, it may also be worth implementing a Health Savings Account (HSA), which can be used to set aside funds to cover costs of procedures that the plan may not cover.\nRegardless of the dental insurance plan chosen, it is important to check on whether it is accepted by your dentist. If the plan is an HMO or PPO, it’s also important to determine if the dentist is within the network of those plans.\nAssociated Dentists is Here to Help\nIf you need any assistance understanding your dental insurance benefits or would like to inform us of any changes to your coverage, reach out to our in-house insurance department at our Madison and Verona locations.", "scores": {"score": 2}}

Moving to this type of automation-based system can save you time and money.\nReactive Versus Proactive IT Support Solutions\nA business that operates with a reactive IT support mindset does not respond to problems until they happen. For instance, if your network goes down and you call someone to come fix it that is reactive care. It may take hours to solve the problem and in the meantime, you’re losing money.\nA business that operates with a proactive IT support mindset invests in 24/7 network monitoring and automated services that ensure IT systems stay patched, updated, and secure. The focus is on detecting and defending against security threats for PCs and network issues before they happen.\nWhat Should You Look for in a solution like ProCare?\nWhile all businesses can benefit from proactive monitoring and maintenance, identifying the maturity level of your IT infrastructure may help determine what kind of support you need.\nCommon features for this type of solution that provide benefits for any size organization include:\n- Network monitoring and proactive maintenance of key network points\n- Automated patching to keep your systems current\n- Responsive remote and onsite IT support options\n- Secure data backup and disaster recovery\n- Comprehensive network security solutions\nAureon ProCare combines 24/7 network monitoring and maintenance with innovative backup and security technologies to monitor your IT infrastructure and designated devices.

Here are a few highlights.\n1. Enhanced Security\nNetwork security should be top of mind for any business, regardless of industry. Proactive IT support typically involves the deployment of antivirus protection and data encryption technology. Network security solutions may include firewall management, content filtering, and intrusion protection. Secure cloud backup and disaster recovery offer advanced protection.\n2. Increased Productivity\nModern businesses rely on technology to stay competitive. Most of your employees cannot even perform their jobs without a stable network connection. If your network goes down unexpectedly, a remote or onsite team who is already familiar with your IT infrastructure will work to quickly find a solution. Less downtime ensures that employees can get back to work and stay productive.\n3. Better Planning\nBecause your network is being monitored and maintained around-the-clock, there is less of a chance for unexpected IT expenses to occur that can easily derail your annual budget. Reporting options on technology performance provide accurate records of where your IT infrastructure stands. They will also help you plan your IT budget for the next fiscal year to achieve your goals.\nDon’t Get Caught Off Guard\nMaking the switch to a proactive IT support system sounds simple enough, but it can be difficult without access to a dedicated team that has the time and resources to work and think ahead.\nYou can pair Aureon ProCare with our other managed IT services to obtain the level of support your business needs, whether you have a small business with limited to no IT resources or a large business with an in-house IT department that needs help tackling complex problems.\nThere’s no time like the present to get proactive and stay ahead of the competition.\nHave you been taking a proactive or reactive approach to network security?

Presto - Andante amabile e con moto - Tempo l\nВремя создания: апрель-июнь 1824 года.\nAnatol Ugorski, фортепиано\nThe summer of 1822 proved to be extremely difficult for Beethoven financially. The costs for the upkeep of his nephew and servants as well as his household were high. His health was bad, so doctors' costs and a forthcoming stay in a spa consumed additional amounts of money. On top of this he had old debts with the publisher Steiner, who now demanded their repayment including interest. Beethoven had also incurred debts with his friend Franz Brentano in Frankfurt, as he had paid him an advance for acting as an agent for the Missa solemnis (which was neither finished nor even sold), as well as with the publisher Artaria in Vienna. In desperation the composer turned to his brother Johann. Johann van Beethoven, the family?s \"financial genius\" who was wealthy and very skilled in business matters, came to Ludwig's aid. He gave him cash and obviously stood security for him with Steiner, so that in the end Beethoven owed Johann 500 florins. But Johann van Beethoven was not wealthy because he was a sentimental businessman. And he knew his brother and his promises. Unlike publishers and friends he did not heed Ludwig's assurances but instead demanded copyright for several of his works, including the Bagatelles which Beethoven wanted to sell to the publisher Peters and which were later to become op. 119. As a result the unavoidable occurred: the brothers argued and had it out through different publishers. Johann tried to sell the Bagatelles, Ludwig tried to prevent this as he thought his brother was cheating him. Schemes and plots abounded, supposed intrigues were uncovered and hatched anew. Ludwig won: via his former pupil Ferdinand Ries, who lived in London, he sold the Bagatelles op. 119 to an English publisher. Once published they no longer had any business value for Johann. He did not, however, give up. To compensate Johann for the lost money, Ludwig had to provide a replacement. As he did not have any money, he provided compensation in the form of a new cycle of six Bagatelles op. 126, which he composed in spring 1824. On 19 June 1824 he told his brother that they were ready for collection.\nThis is the last and probably finest of the three sets of Bagatelles Beethoven wrote. In general, the six works comprising the collection are not as light as those in the earlier sets and the three lone Bagatelles without opus numbers. That said, the opening piece in Op. 126 is decidedly pleasant and light. Marked Andante con moto, it is a mostly serene work whose joyous main theme exudes a sense of self-confidence. Textures lighten in the latter part of the work, as the music takes on an almost angelic glow, heralding the incandescent close of the composer's last piano sonata. The Bagatelle No. 2 in G minor contrasts with the opening work in both its livelier Allegro tempo and somewhat anxious mood. Still, the ambivalent main theme here never tilts toward the dark side in its mixture of the stormy and playful, of the anxious and the delicate. The Bagatelle No. 3 in E flat major, marked Andante, is tranquil in its serenity and grandeur, its theme noble and clearly looking toward the nascent Romantic movement. Does this work augur the mood, perhaps even the keyboard writing, in the middle movement of Brahms' Piano Concerto No. 1? The Bagatelle No. 4 in B minor is a Presto filled with angst in its driving rhythms and heroic, stormy main theme. An alternate melody in the upper register, also lively and energetic, exhibits a measure of calm and gracefulness, and on its second appearance closes out this anxious piece in a relatively subdued mood. The G major No. 5, marked Quasi Allegretto, provides stark contrast to the preceding Bagatelle in its serene, dreamy, and consistently gentle manner. While it offers few technical challenges to the pianist, it will present sufficient interpretive ones. The concluding Bagatelle in E flat major is marked Presto -- Andante amabile e con moto, and begins with a surge of swirling currents that quickly turn tame for the introduction of the dreamy main theme. The music gradually becomes more animated, prodded by elements from the opening, and the theme exhibits a deeper expressive manner in its mixture of heroism and serenity. The opening surge mischievously returns to close out this masterpiece.\n(Robert Cummings, Rovi)", "scores": {"score": 2}}

Gone are the days when bras were just one-size-fits-all and shopping for the right bra was a nightmare task. Now, with the dawn of online shopping, finding a fitting bra for your body type is more convenient and hassle-free than ever before.\nBut how does one determine the right type of bras for their body type? Of course, the first step is to ask yourself question: Am I a plus size, petite, full-figured, or small-breasted woman? And once you’ve established which category you fall into, then you can move onto the next step – shopping for bras!\nThere are bras for every body type from petite to plus size, full-figured to small-breasted. When it comes to online shopping, the options are even better. Online stores offer larger range of sizes than traditional stores. They also carry a more diverse selection of styles and fits and can also help you find the best bras for your body type and give you advice on which fits and fabrics are best for you.\nOnline shopping makes it easy to try on bras without a lot of embarrassment or hassle. You can take your time and go through different styles and sizes to find the one that fits you perfectly. Most sites offer free shipping and returns, so you won’t be stuck with a bra that doesn’t fit. Plus, you can take advantage of online discounts and coupons to get even better deals.\nWhen it comes to full-figured women, fitting a bra properly is especially important. The wrong fit can lead to spillage and discomfort due to straps or not enough support. Going for full-figured bras that feature unique details like wider straps and more structured frames can help provide a great fit and support. Leading retailers make sure to provide bras for full-figured women that flatter their curves while providing the support they need.\nFor small-breasted women, bras with lightweight fabrics that offer minimal support are best. These bras provide just enough coverage without being bulky. They also look great under clothes and won’t make the wearer feel under-supported or uncomfortable. Going for lighter fabrics with delicate details and light padding can help make bigger breasts appear smaller, while adjustable straps can help customize the fit.\nPlus size women have unique needs when it comes to finding the right bra fit. Going for styles that offer firm support and are designed to keep your chest secure and comfortable are must. Plus size bras are usually more structured in order to ensure the bra’s framework provides the necessary support.\nFull-figured and plus-sized women have the additional advantage of finding bras that are designed with lacy details, unique colors, or sexy satin styles that provide a sense of glamour and confidence-boosting effect.\nWhen it comes to petite women, finding bras that fit is equally as important. But, petite bras usually feature thinner straps, less padding, and a shallow neckline in comparison to other sizes. Hosiery and lightweight fabrics are commonly used for a comfortable and snug fit. Petite bras also come in various colors and patterns that are designed to fit smaller frames without sacrificing style.\nShopping for bras can be a complicated and daunting endeavor, but with the help of online shopping, you can find the perfect bras for your body type.

{"id": "50", "text": "Healing is an often neglected part of Fortnite strategy. In the rush to load up on the best gear possible while looting, players often settle for a full shield and one healing item to fall back on. However, healing in Fortnite Season 9 is just as important as any other aspect. Great aim and fast building will help you, but you’ve got to be able to recover from mistakes. This guide will run you through which healing items you should be going for and how to use your healing in more creative ways.\nHealing doesn’t have to just be for getting yourself out of a bad situation. Healing can actively form a part of your strategy, with the right healing set up and some good timing, you can actually use it to allow you to play more recklessly. Pro players often heal up multiple times per game, the confidence of having a fall-back helps them make bigger plays.\nMost players just focus on getting a full shield at the beginning of the game. This is your first healing concern. Following that, you need one of your inventory slots to be taken up by something to use to heal. You won’t typically need to carry more than this since eliminations should give you healing items or add some health on via the siphon. However, if you do keep an extra slot open, you can exploit the late game storms using healing items to stay ahead of the curve.\nHealing Your Shield\nShields are vital for staying alive during interactions with other players. Your options for getting a full shield are limited to:\n- Small Shield –These drop in stacks of three. Each takes only two seconds to drink and gives you 25 shield. These can’t be used to raise your shield above 50.\n- Large Shield –Drop in stacks of one and take five seconds to drink. Each gives you 50 shield.\n- Chug Jug –This is a huge healing item that takes the whole of fifteen seconds to consume These are pretty hard to find but will heal your health and shield fully.\n- Slurp Juice –This heals you up to a full shield if necessary. It grants one extra shield every 0.5 seconds up to 75 if you have the space for it.\n- Chug Splash –This is a new item added to the game that gives you 25 shield per splash. It is used almost instantly by throwing it like a grenade.\nOnce you’ve acquired your full shield, an item like a slurp juice or chug jug can really help you out later in the game. Don’t bother with small shields after the opening of a game. Large shields aren’t even particularly viable when there are better items out there. Chug Splashes can also be really helpful when you need to heal in a hurry. Since they can stack in 6s, a pile of these is going to be the best healing option if it is a little hard to find.\nIf you can find a Slurp Juice or Chug Jug, these are the better choices. Most players will carry some shields, so if you have to prioritise then you should avoid carrying standard shield potions over a med kit.\nAs well as your shield potions, you need equipment to heal your HP. Your options are a bit more limited for HP. However, many of the better choices overlap with shield healing.\n- Bandages – The most common healing item and also kind of useless. It heals you by 15 HP up to 75 HP, it takes 3.5 seconds to use and can stack up to 15. It is quick and efficient, but without healing you up all the way it is less than ideal.\n- Medkit –Slightly less common than the bandages but a lot more useful. This heals your health to 100 no matter how damaged you are. It takes 10 seconds to work and you can carry up to a stack of 3.\n- Cosy Campfire –This is an item you can place on the ground to heal when you’re stood by it. It heals you for up to 50 HP, adding 2 points every second. It can run for up to 25 seconds and be carried in a stack of any size.\n- Chug Splash – This item will give you 25 HP points per splash. It works the same as healing your shield just for HP.\n- Slurp Juice –This also works the same as when used for the shield.\nWhat Healing Items Should You Loot?\nWhen choosing which HP items to go for, there’s a clear winner. Of course, the Medkit is the most useful healing item. However, it can be impractical. The Slurp Juice can provide incremental healing that is invaluable in late-game situations, but a Medkit can get you out of nearly every bad situation. If you’re carrying an HP item to rely on, go for the Medkit if you can find one.\nThe cosy Campfire is really useful for team games. If you’re playing as a Squad or Duo, it is important that one of your team finds one of these to heal everyone up later in the game. The Chug Splash is also effective here. If you manage to find enough Chug Splashes, they are a great way to heal shield or HP for a team or Solo player.\nHealing in The Storm\nHealing helps you out when an encounter goes wrong but it also can be used to ride out the storm. Most players with a decent skill level probably don’t care about the storm anymore. They can easily outrun it and rarely pay much attention to it. However, with the right healing items, you can sustain yourself in the storm, which can be an effective tactic when you’re in the end game of a Fortnite match.\nUsing Medkits with the right timing when combined with a Slurp Juice or a Cosy Campfire can allow you to stay alive in the storm for quite a bit longer than you should be able to. In a close game, this strategy could let you clinch first place when the storm finishes off the Island. If you’re grinding for Hype points, keeping yourself alive in the storm can make all the difference.\nHealing in Fortnite isn’t too complicated but players who neglect it will lose matches that they could have won. Carrying the right healing items is important for staying alive in Fortnite. However, so is aiming properly and actually getting some kills. Once you’ve stocked up on the right healing items, you also need to make sure you’re running the best settings to get the highest frames per second in Fortnite.", "scores": {"score": 1}}
{"id": "51", "text": "Heated Mattress Pads: The Benefits, How They Work, And More\nAfter a long day, there is nothing better than crawling into a warm bed. But what if your bed was always warm? A heated mattress pad can give you the extra warmth you need to get a good night’s sleep.\nWhat are the benefits of using a heated mattress pad\nIf you’re like most people, you spend about one-third of your life asleep. So it’s important to make sure you’re as comfortable as possible when you hit the hay. Otherwise, you might find yourself tossing and turning all night long.\nOne way to ensure a good night’s sleep is to invest in a heated mattress pad. Here are four benefits of using one:\n1. They can help relieve pain.\nIf you suffer from muscle aches or arthritis, a heated mattress pad can help soothe your pains and allow you to get a restful night’s sleep. The heat can also help increase blood flow to the affected areas, which can speed up the healing process.\n2. They can improve circulation.\nPoor circulation can lead to a number of health problems, including cold feet and hands, numbness, and swelling. A heated mattress pad can help improve circulation by dilating blood vessels and expanding capillaries. This, in turn, can reduce the risk of those problems.\n3. They can ease respiratory problems.\nIf you have asthma or allergies, a heated mattress pad can help clear your nasal passages and ease your breathing. The heat can also help relieve congestion by thinning out mucus.\n4. They can boost your immune system.\nThe heat produced by a heated mattress pad can help kill bacteria and viruses, which means it can actually help you fight off illnesses. In fact, one study found that using a heating pad increased white blood cell production in people with arthritis.\nHow does a heated mattress pad work\nA heated mattress pad is a bedding accessory that can be placed on top of a mattress to provide warmth. Most heated mattress pads have multiple heat settings so that users can find the perfect level of warmth for their needs. Some even come with timers so that the heating element will automatically turn off after a certain amount of time, helping to prevent accidental fires.\nWhat are the different settings on a heated mattress pad\nThere are many different settings on a heated mattress pad. The most common settings are low, medium, and high. Low is typically used for sleeping, as it will not cause you to sweat. Medium is usually used for people who have aches and pains, as it can help to relieve them. High is typically used for people who are cold, as it will raise your body temperature.\nIs a heated mattress pad safe to use\nA heated mattress pad is a great way to stay warm and comfortable during the colder months. However, there are a few safety concerns that you should be aware of before using one.\nHeated mattress pads can pose a fire risk if they are not used properly. Make sure to follow the manufacturer’s instructions carefully and never leave the pad unattended while it is on. Also, be sure to place the pad on a fire-resistant surface such as a sheet of plywood.\nIf you have any medical conditions that affect your circulation or temperature sensitivity, you should check with your doctor before using a heated mattress pad. Otherwise, enjoy the extra warmth and comfort!\nHow long does it take for a heated mattress pad to heat up\nMost heated mattress pads will heat up within ten minutes or less. Some models may have a preheat feature that will allow you to warm up the bed before you get in it. It is important to read the manufacturer’s instructions before using this feature, as some models require that you turn off the preheat function once the bed is warmed up, while others will automatically turn off after a set amount of time.\nHow much does a heated mattress pad cost\nIf you’re looking for a way to keep your bed warm and cozy all winter long, a heated mattress pad is a great option. But how much does one cost?\nPrices for heated mattress pads can vary depending on the size, features, and brand. A basic twin-size heated mattress pad can start at around $30, while a more deluxe king-size model can cost upwards of $200.\nSome features that can affect the price include multiple heat settings, automatic shut-off, and a preheat function. If you live in a particularly cold climate or tend to get chilly at night, spending a bit more on a higher-end model may be worth it.\nNo matter what your budget is, there’s a heated mattress pad out there that will suit your needs. So don’t let the cold weather keep you from getting a good night’s sleep – snuggle up with a heated mattress pad and stay nice and toasty all winter long!\nCan a heated mattress pad be used on any bed\nIf you’re looking for a way to add a little extra warmth to your bed, a heated mattress pad is a great option. But can a heated mattress pad be used on any bed? The answer is yes! Heated mattress pads are designed to fit all standard mattresses, so you can use one on any bed in your home. Just make sure to follow the manufacturer’s instructions for safe use.\nWhat is the warranty on a heated mattress pad\nHeated mattress pads are a great way to keep warm in bed during the colder months. But what happens if your heated mattress pad stops working? Most heated mattress pads come with a one-year warranty, so you should be covered if something goes wrong. However, it’s always a good idea to check with the manufacturer before you make a purchase to see what their warranty policy is. That way, you’ll know exactly what you’re getting into before you buy.\nHow do I clean a heated mattress pad\nHeated mattress pads are a great way to keep your bed warm and cozy all winter long. But as with any bedding, they need to be cleaned periodically to prevent build-up of dirt, dust, and other allergens. Here are some tips for cleaning your heated mattress pad:\n1. Unplug the mattress pad and remove it from the bed.\n2. Vacuum the mattress pad with a handheld vacuum or the attachment of your regular vacuum cleaner. Pay special attention to the seams and crevices, where dirt and dust tend to accumulate.\n3. If there are any stains on the mattress pad, treat them with a mild stain remover before washing.\n4. Wash the mattress pad in your washing machine using warm water and a gentle detergent.\n5. Hang the mattress pad to dry, or put it in the dryer on low heat.\n6. Once the mattress pad is completely dry, plug it in and put it back on the bed. Enjoy your cozy, warm bed!\nWhere can I buy a heated mattress pad\nThere are a few places you can buy a heated mattress pad. Some stores that sell bedding, such as Bed, Bath & Beyond, Macy’s, and Target, sell them. You can also buy them online at Amazon.com and Walmart.com. Heated mattress pads come in different sizes and prices, so it is important to find one that fits your budget and needs.", "scores": {"score": 1}}

{"id": "53", "text": "The medieval enchantment of Crystal Ball is brought to life using clear no-nonsense graphics and well sized symbols. The base game has a simple set up with the action taking place in the dark and murky wooded area outside the wizard’s mansion. In the free games, the game is given an orange background glow and the sound effects intensify, to add to the suspense and enjoyment of the free game play.\nThe game’s theme also extends to the symbols on the reels. There are four higher value theme related symbols including the wizard, a bottled magic green potion, a unicorn and a chain pendant holding a blue gem. The lower value symbols are represented by the royals A, J, K, Q and 10. The crystal ball itself acts as a wild and scatter symbol, which is where the slot takes its name from.\nIn addition to being the wild symbol, the crystal ball can also act as a scatter symbol and it provides the opportunity to win 10 free games. The crystal ball will award a scatter payment when at least three of them land anywhere on the reels. When this occurs ten free games are activated. Once the free game bonus is triggered a bonus symbol is automatically selected before the free games can commence. The bonus symbol can be any symbol except the crystal ball. The free games continue with the same playing concept; however, if the bonus symbol lands on any two or more reels, a payline win is awarded even if the symbols are not adjacent to one another along a payline.\nUpon landing a win, players have the choice of two gamble features that can be used to try to increase the winnings. These options will automatically appear below the reels on the right-hand side of the display screen. The two options are the ‘Ladder Gamble’ and the ‘Card Gamble’.\nThe Ladder gamble option is accessed by pressing the button with the ladder symbol. Each upward step of the ladder represents a higher value win. Players have the chance to work their way up each rung of the ladder and increase the winnings as they go. However, if the gamble is unsuccessful it can lead to a partial or total loss of the initial win. The ladder gamble will highlight the value of the potential win or loss during each particular turn. There is also an option after the base game win, and each successful gamble thereafter, to collect half of the gamble win and continue to gamble with the remaining amount, which is perfect for those who want to reduce the risk.\nThe card gamble is entered via the button with the card symbol. Again, you have the chance to increase your win only this time the gamble is placed on guessing the colour of the face down card at the top of the pack. After picking a colour, the top card is revealed and if players have chosen correctly then the payout is doubled. Selecting the wrong colour results in the gamble being fully lost. Similar to the Ladder gamble, there is an option to collect half of the win or gamble win and then continue to gamble with the remainder.\nCrystal Ball slot is a high volatility game and it has an RTP of 96.12%, which is slightly above average for online slots. Low volatility slots pay out small amounts regularly, whereas high volatility slots pay out large amounts less frequently. As such, players may have to play several spins of this slot before they see a return.\nThe slot has a top standard payout of 1000x that is won by landing five wizards along a payline. The unicorn can payout up too 400x, the green bottled potion and blue gem pendant payout up too 150x while the royals payout between 20x and 30x. Of course, with the aid of the gamble feature, it is possible to win far more than this from a single spin.\nHow to Play\nCrystal Ball is an easy to play slot. Before spinning the reels, all the player needs to do is set his/her total bet per spin using the buttons beneath the reels. The total bet should be divided by 20 to calculate the individual payline bet. All the player then needs to do is click on the spin button. There is also auto play functionality that can be used to set up to 100 spins in motion complete with win and loss limits.", "scores": {"score": 1}}

If any man walk in the day he stumbleth not, because he seeth the light of this world.\n10 But if a man walk in the night, he stumbleth because there is no light in him.”\n11 These things said He, and after that He said unto them, “Our friend Lazarus sleepeth; but I go, that I may awaken him out of sleep.”\n12 Then said His disciples, “Lord, if he sleep he shall do well.”\n13 However Jesus spoke of his death, but they thought that He had spoken of the taking of rest in sleep.\n14 Then Jesus said unto them plainly, “Lazarus is dead.\n15 And I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, to the intent that ye may believe. Nevertheless let us go unto him.”\n16 Then Thomas, who was called Didymus, said unto his fellow disciples, “Let us also go, that we may die with Him.”\n17 Then when Jesus came, He found that he had lain in the grave four days already.\n18 Now Bethany was nigh unto Jerusalem, about two miles away,\n19 and many of the Jews came to Martha and Mary to comfort them concerning their brother.\n20 Then Martha, as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming, went and met Him; but Mary sat still in the house.\n21 Then Martha said unto Jesus, “Lord, if Thou hadst been here, my brother would not have died.\n22 But I know that even now, whatsoever Thou wilt ask of God, God will give it Thee.”\n23 Jesus said unto her, “Thy brother shall rise again.”\n24 Martha said unto Him, “I know that he shall rise again at the resurrection on the Last Day.”\n25 Jesus said unto her, “I am the resurrection and the Life. He that believeth in Me, though he were dead, yet shall he live;\n26 and whosoever liveth and believeth in Me shall never die. Believest thou this?”\n27 She said unto Him, “Yea, Lord, I believe that Thou art the Christ, the Son of God, who should come into the world.”\n28 And when she had so said, she went her way and called Mary her sister secretly, saying, “The Master has come, and calleth for thee.”\n29 As soon as she heard that, she arose quickly and came unto Him.\n30 Now Jesus had not yet come into the town, but was in that place where Martha met Him.\n31 The Jews then, who were with her in the house and comforting her, when they saw that Mary rose up hastily and went out, followed her, saying, “She goeth unto the grave to weep there.”\n32 Then when Mary had come where Jesus was and saw Him, she fell down at His feet, saying unto Him, “Lord, if Thou hadst been here, my brother would not have died.”\n33 When Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews also weeping who came with her, He groaned in the spirit and was troubled,\n34 and said, “Where have ye laid him?” They said unto Him, “Lord, come and see.”\n35 Jesus wept.\n36 Then said the Jews, “Behold, how he loved him!”\n37 And some of them said, “Could not this man, who opened the eyes of the blind, have caused that even this man should not have died?”\n38 Jesus therefore again, groaning in Himself, came to the grave. It was a cave, and a stone lay against it.\n39 Jesus said, “Take ye away the stone.” Martha, the sister of him that was dead, said unto Him, “Lord, by this time there is a stench, for he hath been dead four days.”\n40 Jesus said unto her, “Said I not unto thee that if thou would believe, thou should see the glory of God?”\n41 Then they took away the stone from the place where the dead was laid. And Jesus lifted up His eyes and said, “Father, I thank Thee that Thou hast heard Me.\n42 And I knew that Thou hearest Me always, but because of the people who stand by I said it, that they may believe that Thou hast sent Me.”\n43 And when He thus had spoken, He cried with a loud voice, “Lazarus, come forth!”\n44 And he that was dead came forth, bound hand and foot with graveclothes, and his face was bound about with a napkin. Jesus said unto them, “Loose him, and let him go.”\n45 Then many of the Jews who came to Mary and had seen the things which Jesus did, believed in Him.\n46 But some of them went their ways to the Pharisees, and told them what things Jesus had done.\n47 Then gathered the chief priests and the Pharisees a council and said, “What shall we do? For this man doeth many miracles.\n48 If we let him thus alone, all men will believe in him, and the Romans shall come and take away both our place and nation.”\n49 And one of them named Caiaphas, being the high priest that same year, said unto them, “Ye know nothing at all,\n50 nor consider that it is expedient for us that one man should die for the people, and that the whole nation perish not.”\n51 And he spoke this not of himself, but, being high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus should die for that nation;\n52 and not for that nation only, but that also He should gather together in one the children of God who were scattered abroad.\n53 So from that day forth, they took counsel together to put Him to death.\n54 Jesus therefore walked no longer openly among the Jews, but went thence unto a region near the wilderness into a city called Ephraim, and there continued with His disciples.\n55 And the Jews’ Passover was nigh at hand, and many went out of the country up to Jerusalem before the Passover to purify themselves.\n56 Then they sought for Jesus and spoke among themselves as they stood in the temple, saying, “What think ye — that he will not come to the feast?”\n57 Now both the chief priests and the Pharisees had given a command that if any man knew where He was, he should report it, that they might take Him.", "scores": {"score": 2}}

It was decorated some 2,500 years ago by Athenian artist Euphronios, and its subsequent history involves tomb raiding, intrigue, duplicity, litigation, international outrage, and possibly even homicide. How this came about is told by Nigel Spivey in a concise, stylish book that braids together the creation and adventures of this extraordinary object with an exploration of its abiding influence.\nSpivey takes the reader on a dramatic journey, beginning with the krater’s looting from an Etruscan tomb in 1971 and its acquisition by the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, followed by a high-profile lawsuit over its status and its eventual return to Italy. He explains where, how, and why the vase was produced, retrieving what we know about the life and legend of Sarpedon. Spivey also pursues the figural motif of the slain Sarpedon portrayed on the vase and traces how this motif became a standard way of representing the dead and dying in Western art, especially during the Renaissance.\nFascinating and informative, The Sarpedon Krater is a multifaceted introduction to the enduring influence of Greek art on the world.", "scores": {"score": 3}}
{"id": "60", "text": "Milling around the Monster Stage at the start of Slam Dunk 2015, the crowd enjoys a sudden burst of glaring sunshine, after cloudy skies have threatened rain all morning. It’s clear that this is a festival with its own unique feel – there’s a real sense of family at Slam Dunk. The genres vary, and not everyone will agree on the acts performing here today, but there’s a level of respect among the bands.\nFirst up is The Colour Morale. It could’ve been the Desperados samples quickly necked to make the set, but three songs in I’m so impressed I order a t-shirt from their merch site there and then. This band should be more than an opening act – energy, showmanship and talent on display from start to finish.\nNext on the radar are Beartooth, hugely hyped. The crowd expect big things. Unfortunately Beartooth don’t deliver. Maybe it’s all the talk, but the American metalcore outfit live lack the raw emotion and energy found on their record. A disappointment – but the next act can’t possibly disappoint.\nMarachi El Bronx are something a bit different to break up the day: a fun band, a great crowd, smiles all round and a brilliant atmosphere. Definitely a band to see live, they have an individual sound and their good time feels are infectious.\nLate in the day and eager to experience the full force of this rock festival we head back to the Monster Stage for Crossfaith. There are a lot of bands out there boasting a “brutal” mosh pit but going front centre for a Crossfaith show really is a calculated risk. This band knows how to work a crowd without any frontman stunts – everything about them is real and raw. After a blinding set we are left sweaty, disoriented and wondering what the hell has just happened. Crossfaith chew us up and spit us out – and it was awesome.\nPhotos: Scott Wight\nNext up, Finch, a childhood favourite for about 90 per cent of the festivalgoers, if not for me. Nate Barcalow rattles out some of the best screams of the day, followed by some of the most powerful cleans we’ve heard. It’s a rarity to find these two talents in one man, and I, for one, will be rooting for their big comeback.\nOver to the main stage, outdoors in Leeds’ Millennium Square, to see the now veteran rockers Taking Back Sunday. Hit and miss in the past, they are absolutely on form for Slam Dunk’s tenth anniversary. Adam Lazarra displays great vocals and serious fitness, bouncing around the stage, delivering the passionate performance expected of the main support. Deserving of their spot on the day, TBS give a stomping performance.\nWe’re sunburnt, bruised and slightly squiffy, and it’s time for the headline act. But with brilliant bands conflicting there are some deep and meaningful discussions among the crowds about which to see. But with the rumours of a certain act going back to their roots in their setlist, for me at least it’s an obvious choice.\nOpening with The Truth Is A Terrible Thing – their first performance of it in five years – You Me At Six immediately put the rumours to rest. They dive straight into Save It For The Bedroom and the crowd completely loses it. This is only the beginning. We are treated to vintage gems like Jealous Minds Think Alike, Take Off Your Colours, The Rumour and Always Attract – none of which have been played for two years or more.\nThese, along with crowd favourites Stay With Me, Reckless and Loverboy, demonstrate their impressive canon and their ability to stay current and interesting for fans of all ages, backgrounds and tastes. With a powerful performance from every band member YMAS are a force to be reckoned with. A deserved main stage headliner at any festival but never more at home than at Slam Dunk.\nSlam Dunk 2015, Millennium Square, Leeds, 23 May", "scores": {"score": 1}}

England’s 2005 Ashes series victory, and the last gasp win against Australia in the 2003 Rugby World Cup were epic sporting occasions, but nothing touches football for the intensity of the rivalry, so what a shame it is that it is packed full of utter pricks at all levels.\nFrom Lord Triesman claiming that Jonny Foreigner (Spain and Russia) is about to bribe Refs at the 2010 World Cup, to gum chewing snarling dictator Alex Ferguson, right through to badge kissing players, and fat fans crying for the Sky cameras after relegation, there is so much to hate about football.\nChelsea are top of my hate list, they have so many players that are just peasants who have come in to cash, they snarl, they rip their shirts off and puff their waxed chests out, they kiss their club badge whilst refusing to sign a new contract unless there is another 30k a week on the table, and yet there is still something far worse than any of this. PRETENDING TO ROCK A BABY AS A GOAL CELEBRATION FOR A WAG WHO HAS JUST GIVEN BIRTH AAAAAAAAAAAAAARGGGHHHH!!! The first act of the new parliament should have been to introduce the public flogging of footballers who carry out this sickening act.\nSome people would say that I am just jealous of the riches and celebrity these cunts (I am sorry I can’t just call them buggers) enjoy, but if that was the case why am I not jealous of Paul Scholes or Ryan Giggs for example? One presumes they are mega rich, but their conduct is a breath of fresh air to the rest. Roy Hodgson the Manager of Fulham is another example, you just can’t dislike him or his team. He is a strange loveable character talking like Harold Steptoe, and actually looking like someone from an early 1970’s Michael Caine film like the Italian job. Maybe it is an Ashes to Ashes remake; “My name is Roy Hodgson. In 1972 I was hit by a car, and now I am a manager of a Football club in 2010, is it a dream, or am I dead, and if I am alive, how do I get away from this fucking nonsense and back to my normal life.”\nImagine if next season started and Hodgson had just disappeared like he had never been there!\nHodgson: Time travel Ashes to Ashes style?\nI am just not excited about the World Cup like I have been in the past, but I guess I will get more in to it as it approaches, and maybe in between the diving, the cheating, and the exaggerated commentary whenever Christiano Ronaldo or Lionel Messi touch the ball, we might get some exciting football.\nIt is just a relief that John Terry has been stripped of the captaincy of England, it would be hard to feel pleased for him if a limited England side pulled out all the stops and won the World Cup in South Africa. I just can’t like the guy, or any of his Chelsea team mates.

{"id": "80", "text": "In Washington, divorcing parents have a handful of options when it comes to structuring custody and parenting time after their divorce. One of these options is to establish a joint custody arrangement. When divorced parents share joint custody, each parent spends an equal (or roughly equal) amount of time with their children. For example, they may alternate custody on a weekly basis, or they may agree to an alternate arrangement that better suits their respective work schedules while also serving the best interests of their children.\nWhile joint custody can be a good option under the right circumstances, it also inherently presents certain challenges for divorced parents. Divorced parents who share joint custody will need to continue to communicate, and they will need to be cooperative with one another in order to provide as much stability for their children as possible.\n7 Tips for Maintaining an Amicable Joint Custody Arrangement after Your Divorce\nIf you are considering a joint custody agreement, or if you currently have a joint custody agreement and are facing challenges in dealing with your former spouse, what can you do to make your parenting arrangement more amicable?

In order to ensure that you are upholding your end of the deal – and to make sure you have a clear understanding of your former spouse’s obligations as well – it is important to carefully review the terms of your agreement.\nWhat does your joint custody agreement say about transportation? What does it say about pick-up and drop-off windows? What does it say about phone time, curfews, and other similar types of parenting issues? Before discussing issues or concerns with your former spouse, you will want to make sure you know exactly what your agreement says with regard to your respective rights and responsibilities.\nTip #2: Have a Plan for Communicating with Your Former Spouse\nIf you need to discuss an issue with your former spouse, make sure you have a plan for how and when you communicate your concerns. For example, firing off a text message during your former spouse’s parenting time might not be as effective as carefully writing an email or suggesting that you need to schedule a mutually convenient time to talk. Oftentimes, disputes become contentious not because of what is said, but because of how the message is conveyed. If you set the stage for an amicable discussion, you may be able to achieve a positive outcome without engendering unwarranted hostility.\nTip #3: Do Not Involve Your Children in Any Communications about Issues or Concerns\nAfter a divorce, it is not uncommon for parents to only come into contact when their children are present. However, if you have concerns that you need to address or issues that you need to resolve, it is very important that you communicate with your former spouse outside of your children’s presence. Divorced parents should not involve their children in custody disputes, as this can have negative psychological effects that endure long after the issue is resolved.\nIn this same vein, divorced parents should not ask their children to communicate messages for them, and they should not try to negatively influence their children’s perception of their other parent. Not only can these engender hostility between the parents and increase the likelihood of a contentious dispute, but they can have negative psychological effects for the children as well.\nTip #4: Consider What Constitutes an Appropriate Response\nWhile both parents should strictly adhere to the terms of their joint custody agreement, issues come up, and some grace is to be expected. If your former spouse is occasionally five minutes late dropping off your children, this is a very different matter from consistently “canceling” a pickup at the last minute.\nIn order to maintain a peaceful joint custody arrangement, it may be necessary to overlook the occasional minor transgression. On the other hand, this can also be a slippery slope, and you also need to know when to say when. If your former spouse is not complying with your joint custody agreement and you have questions about what you should do, you should speak with an attorney before making any significant decisions.\nTip #5: Seek Advice When Necessary\nTransitioning to life after divorce is not easy, and adjusting to a joint custody arrangement takes time. If you are struggling, if you have questions, or if you are feeling isolated or helpless, you should not hesitate to seek advice. A family attorney can help you with any legal issues related to your joint custody arrangement, and friends, family members, and support groups can provide you with practical advice. Psychologists, social workers, and other professionals can provide invaluable advice for post-divorce parenting as well.\nTip #6: Do Not Let Issues Linger\nIf you run into an issue with your former spouse, it is generally not a good idea to let the issue linger. While some issues will go away, many will not. Addressing the issue before it gets worse can increase your chances of finding an amicable solution and help you maintain a peaceful joint custody arrangement.\nTip #7: Seek a Modification If You Can No Longer Comply with Your Joint Custody Agreement\nFinally, if your circumstances change and you are no longer able to comply with your joint custody agreement, this is an issue that you will want to address proactively as well. Violating the terms if your agreement can have serious consequences, and it’s something that you want to avoid if at all possible.\nSpeak with a Custody Attorney at Bolan Law Group.\nDo you have questions about establishing joint custody or what to do if you encounter a custody-related issue after your divorce?

{"id": "82", "text": "“So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.” (Romans 10:17)\nNow, right off the bat as they say, the question for you, perhaps the most important question that will ever be asked of you, how is your faith in the Lord Jesus Christ as your personal Savior expressed, how do you prove to yourself that you are hid in Christ, that you are the righteousness of God in Christ.\nThere is no debating our salvation in our mind, not as a whole unit, you either know for a fact that you have been saved by the grace of God through faith in Jesus Christ or you do not. Forget those fleeting moments of doubt here for a moment, they are your flesh, your old nature trying to come up for air, forget the advances of Satanic forces whispering in your ear occasionally, answer the question, how is your faith in the Lord expressed not to the outside world, not to your spouse, children, friends or family, but in your heart?\n“Examine yourselves, whether ye be in the faith; prove your own selves. Know ye not your own selves, how that Jesus Christ is in you, except ye be reprobates?” (2nd Cor. 13:5)\nIt’s one or the other, not both, not saved sometimes and the other at other times not saved, it isn’t the foolishness of the Roman Catholic cult and their lie of the “sin of presumption,” it isn’t the Mormons with their works-based ideologies or any other sinful religious organization that should enter into your mind here, it is what does your heart tells you, the heart that the Lord looks at, how does it express the knowledge, the unquestionable fact that Jesus Christ is the Lord of your life, that you are going to heaven, that you will spend eternity in the presence of the joy of the Lord, experiencing pleasures forevermore?\nI hope you did not say, “It’s a feeling I have,” for that heart is deceitful continuously, and faith is not feeling saved, faith is the knowledge that you are saved.\nWhat does your heart say? I hope it’s not any external evidence that sways your heart, plenty of food and water, a warm comfortable place to rest you head at night, fairly good health, or any other item that coerces your heart, as long as those items remain.\nDo you believe your salvation is assured, beyond questioning, an absolute guarantee?\nI will offer you what I can, but it is not the answer of your heart necessarily, no matter the circumstances or the possible consequences to yourself, that’s the best I have for you. If your heart can say that, then there is a very good possibility that you are indeed saved. But I offer you now, at least in what I have been shown to write in this short letter, one simple verse that will prove to you where your heart truly is, where your faith truly lies.\nIf you read it and mean it, if your heart rejoices in it no matter where the Lord leads you for the glory of God, if you can honestly say Thy will be done when you read this verse, then rejoice greatly, for your rewards will be great, and you will stand in the presence of God Himself. That verse?\n“For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain.” (Phil. 1:21)", "scores": {"score": 1}}

{"id": "84", "text": "The municipality will hear a delegation from Woodfibre LNG next month to discuss the liquefied natural gas facility being constructed outside Squamish.\nThe company requested a presentation at an upcoming council meeting to talk about the project, located at the site of the former Woodfibre pulp and paper mill southwest of the town. In a letter to Bowen Island Municipality the company says they’re “committed to contributing to a net-zero future, driven by innovation; ensuring meaningful reconciliation with Indigenous people; and providing positive socioeconomic benefits for Squamish and neighbouring communities, including Bowen Island.”\nThe multi-billion dollar facility being built on Howe Sound will employ about 100 workers and produce millions of tonnes of LNG a year once fully operational. Final cleanup is expected this year, with construction beginning in 2023 and an anticipated completion date of 2027.\n“2022 will be a milestone year for the company and we would appreciate the opportunity to provide a comprehensive update on our project to Bowen Island Mayor and Council,” wrote Julia Diamond, Woodfibre’s senior manager of government relations.\nBut not everybody was eager to roll out the welcome mat. “My first reaction to this letter was quite negative,” said Coun. Maureen Nicholson during the March 28 meeting. “The last time the LNG roadshow came to Bowen Island was – from my perspective – a particularly unpleasant visit.”\nBut Nicholson said after speaking with community members, “the response was basically, ‘bring it on’.”\n“People are interested in hearing what was happened in the 6.5-7 years since Woodfibre spoke with us. For the delegation, I hope there actually will be an opportunity for the public to put forward their questions,” said Nicholson.\nThe strongest opposition to the visit came from Coun. Sue Ellen Fast. “We need to spend our limited time at council meetings on significant business for our community, and not going over business that we’ve already made decisions about,” she said.\n“Since February 2015 council has been passing motions of non-support of that Woodfibre LNG proposal,” said Fast, pointing out as recently as two years ago council voted to “direct staff to communicate to the Provincial Environmental Assessment Office that Bowen Island Municipality continues to not support the Woodfibre LNG project.” (Councillors Michael Kaile and Alison Morse opposed this directive, according to the minutes for the May 25, 2020 meeting.)\n“So I think we should just receive the letter, but tell them we’ve done lots of work on it. They don’t need to take up our time at a council meeting about it,” continued Fast. “If they want to come and hold an open house or put an article in the Undercurrent, there’s lots of other venues.”\nBut consensus seemed to be hearing from the company was for the best.\n“I get Coun. Fast’s comments. On the flipside I think it’s important that we are in the loop and know what’s going on,” said Coun. Rob Wynen. “Even if we don’t support this project, I don’t see any reason why us knowing what is happening there is a hindrance.”\n“I know some people have had questions about that operation, and it would be a chance for us to ask those questions and clarify anything we want to clarify… I think we should be open minded,” added Morse.\nCouncil voted to have staff schedule a presentation date, with Fast the lone councillor in opposition.", "scores": {"score": 1}}

{"id": "86", "text": "Breastfeeding in public\nWhat is the Breastfeeding Friendly Award?\nWe have worked hard in Sheffield to help mums and their families to feel confident and comfortable when breastfeeding in public.\nThe Breastfeeding Friendly Award was developed to help you to identify public places and workplaces in the city that offer a good level of facilities and support for you when you are breastfeeding.\nIt is your legal right to breastfeed your child in public, for as long as you wish to do so, but if you need extra reassurance when breastfeeding in the early days then look out for the Breastfeeding Friendly Venues. These places know that you have a legal right to breastfeed anywhere but wish to create an environment that makes you feel welcomed and supported.\nThe Equality Act 2010\nThis Act states that it is sex discrimination to treat a woman unfavourably because she is breastfeeding. It applies to anyone providing services, benefits, facilities and premises to the public, public bodies, further and higher education bodies and associations.\nIf you are breastfeeding in a public place such as a café, park, shop, cinema,, on a bus etc, you cannot be asked to stop or refused to be served. You are also protected on public transport such as buses, trains and planes.\nWho has this award?\nThe list of Breastfeeding Friendly venues includes leisure centres, cafes, restaurants, libraries and play areas which all support breastfeeding in Sheffield. The venues usually display a window sticker showing the Breastfeeding Friendly sign.\nHave a look at the list of Sheffield Breastfeeding Friendly Venues 2023 to find places in each area of Sheffield.\nWould you like your venue to be Breastfeeding Friendly?\nHave a look at the Breastfeeding Friendly checklist to see whether your venue would be eligible for the Breastfeeding Friendly Award.\nWe would be happy to consider any business, community venue or service for the award, if it is somewhere that could be used by breastfeeding mums. If you are unsure what is involved, or would like to discuss it further, please contact us at Breastfeeding in Sheffield.\nTop Tips for Breastfeeding in Public\nHow do I avoid flashing my boobs?\nClothes that work:\n- Tops that unbutton from the bottom as they can be worn over vest tops\n- Stretchy tops, vests or cropped tops – can be layered up and pulled up or down.\n- You can buy clothes especially for breastfeeding but it isn’t always necessary. Have a look at the ‘Can I breastfeed in it?’ website for ideas and inspiration\n- Jackets, shirts over a vest top and cardigans can be used as screens and will cover almost everything!\n- Scarves are also good at keeping things under wraps.\n- Use a sling or a pouch – they make carrying the baby easier on your back and cover most of the boob as well. Contact one of Sheffield’s sling groups for advice on sling carrying and read our information on sling wearing, in the section ‘Keeping your baby Close’\nClothes that don’t work:\n- Shirts you have to unbutton from the top – make you feel really exposed.\n- Practice! The more you do it, the better you get at getting baby latched on quickly. You can do this without even leaving your living room.\n- Use your local breastfeeding support group to practice in front of other people.\n- Use the groups at your local Family Hub to meet other mums, Breastfeeding in Sheffield – Support Groups June-Sept 2023 (1)You can share advice and support each other.\n- It might be a big deal for you, but most people don’t even notice.\n- Remember why you’re doing it – for your baby! The most important thing in your life. Who cares what other people think?\n- Breastfeeding is an amazing achievement – be proud of it!\n- Share your experiences with other mums on the Breastfeeding in Sheffield Facebook page. It helps to hear how other parents have coped.\nTime and Place\n- Take a friend with you in the early days, until you feel more confident.\n- Try and get settled somewhere before your baby gets hungry.\n- Find a spot where you won’t be disturbed. If you have to keep moving it might upset your baby’s feed.\nFind a Quiet Spot\n- Seek out one of Sheffield’s Breastfeeding Friendly places. They offer facilities and support for you and your family\n- Some mums don’t mind feeding anywhere, others feel better if they can find somewhere out of the way but never resort to feeding in a public toilet!\nThe Equality Act in more detail\nThe Equality Act 2010 came into force in October 2010. It says that it is sex discrimination to treat a woman unfavourably because she is breastfeeding. It applies to anyone providing services, benefits, facilities and premises to the public, public bodies, further and higher education bodies and associations.\nWhat does this mean?\n- Service providers that deal directly with the public must not discriminate, harass or victimise a woman because she is breastfeeding.\n- Discrimination includes refusing to provide a service, providing a lower standard of service or providing a service on different terms.\n- If you are breastfeeding in a public place such as a café, park, shop, cinema etc you cannot be asked to stop or refused to be served. You are also protected on public transport such as buses, trains and planes.\n- The law protects you for as long as you wish to breastfeed your baby.\n- Further and higher education bodies must not discriminate, harass or victimise a student who is breastfeeding in terms of admission or provision of education or by excluding the student.\n- An association is a club that has rules of membership and at least 25 T\nIf you are discriminated against, you should make a complaint to the organisation that has discriminated against you. Most places have a complaints procedure, if not; you should ask who to complain to.\nIf you cannot resolve the matter you can bring an action in the county court in England or Wales or a Sheriffs court in Scotland but you should seek advice as this can be expensive.", "scores": {"score": 2}}
{"id": "87", "text": "A truly fascinating day. On several levels. Mostly with the extreme speed fish can vanish. It all began, with Jon...\n1st Sailing. and it took three moves, but then we found some consistent bass fishing. Quality schoolies. Some other threatening to push 2.5lb. But most importantly, plenty of action, which has been missing the past couple of sailings. So, there were big smiles. And also, the wind which began with stiff and particularly chilly gusts, backed down as the air warmed from an early sun ascending in a cloudless sky. A common phenomenon these past few days. Something to do with the difference between land and sea temperatures perhaps. Calmed enough, to consider the big bass bank.\n\"Jon, I know a place, where the bass don't get caught under 5lb\" I said. \"Righto\" he replied, with that cheeky smirk that suggests he thinks I am pulling his leg. \"You don't believe me do you? \" I enquired. \"Right... Reel up\" I passed him a heavier shad, and informed him we might get wet, as there was a bit of swell offshore.\nOn arrival. I gave Jon strict instruction. And then I watched, as he took 8 fish to my halfhearted take, on consecutive drifts to the end of the session. Amazing. If a little frustrating. Sadly 3-4lb stamp. No sign of those long lean ones from a week ago. Most importantly, for my client, very enjoyable fishing. The pure delight each time his rod bent over. Especially when mine did not... One very happy Jon left the boat, and happened to bump into my clients for the next session. Bubbling away, he explained to them about the 25 fish, and the excellent average size.\nShall I bother with writing the rest of this blog? As I am guessing you know where it is going. After really good action, I truly expected to pick up where I left off. But for Mark and Armando, it was simply a struggle. The wind had veered a little more easterly and increased, which restricted visiting the more deep marks. But nothing but a single schoolie for the entire session. The exact reverse of the 1st session. And I was very sad for the guys lack of action. But, they are seasoned BIF1 anglers, and have seen how it works.\nNext up, was Bruno returning for another go. He had a great session on his previous trip, with bream and bass, and had already been fishing on the marina with a couple of plaice to his credit already. This session was slightly less severe than the previous one. Bruno had a mackerel, and we found a couple of schoolies. We even popped out to the big fish place over the low tide, but with the new flood, the wind suddenly tracked SE and got up forcing us back to inshore. This wind now became a major feature, with some very strange swells created by the wind veering NE, then SE, and blowing hard.\nDespite all this, we fished on. And Bruno proved his patience warranted with a nice fish from a fairly inshore mark. But then nothing to the end of the session, despite really covering some reefs. Lots of bait fish showing on the sounder. But nothing interested to eat them. With the flood tide now pushing hard, the confused swell got worse. Combined with the poor fishing, I made the decision to cancel the final sailing.\nBut every day is different. Indeed, as has been proven time and time again,. every sailing is often very different. Seeing what the next day is going to bring, is a lot of the fun of the job for me. And hopefully, through this blog, for you also.", "scores": {"score": 1}}

So as we’re gifting treasures to our favorite people, we’re also creating an ugly amount of waste for our planet. It’s high time our thoughtfulness goes past what’s inside the box. Today, we’re teaming up with Allbirds and their #ScrapTheWrap campaign to bring you four charming, greener ways to wrap those gifts.\nThink outside of the box, y’all. Literally.\nAllbirds has long been a B+C favorite, and not just because of its cult-like following. The shoes are comfortable enough to wear sans socks (which this author does, often), and they’re machine washable too. What’s more, the shoes are made with ZQ-certified merino wool and other premium natural materials, so they’re gentle on the planet. Aside from the ever-popular Wool Runners and Wool Loungers, Allbirds now offers Smallbirds, AKA adorable, pint-sized Wool Runners for toddlers. How flippin’ cute are they?! Forgive the pun, but these are totally a shoe-in gift for anyone on your list.\nNow, let’s get decorating!\nDIY Snowy Maze Box\nWhat’s more fun than opening gifts? Traveling through a snowy maze to reach the gift, first! (Hello, that’s why treasure hunts are so irresistible.) We painted a 3D maze onto an Allbirds box to maximize the FUN of opening the gift. Go the extra mile and gift a toy sheep as well to hint at the merino wool wonders inside.\nScroll on for the DIY.\nMaterials + Tools:\n- Allbirds shoebox\n- Remove the items from your box. Trace the full maze onto the box with a pencil. To really maximize the fun, we made sure the trail would go over four sides of the box before arriving at each shoe pocket. Draw decor around the maze, such as trees, snowcaps, or forest animals.\n- Paint your designs on the exterior of the box, then let it dry.\n- Finish up the outside of the box by painting the trail black. Feel free to add embellishments too!\n- Once the outside of the box is completely dry, paint the inside of the box. We hid the gift recipient’s name inside the box to make it even more special. Add other personal touches as desired, then let it dry.\nAdd your gift back into the box. You’re done!\nAfter the big gift unveiling, save the box for future play adventures with your kiddos.\n3 More Ways to #ScrapTheWrap\nCotton Ball Sheep: Use leftover cotton balls and paper scraps to make 3D sheep! We hot glued these onto an old gift box, then added googly eyes for extra magic. Now that is one charming baaaaah-x :)\nColor-Dipped Leaves: Dip found leaves in paint, let dry, then glue them onto your box. We used leftover house paint, but any paint lying around the house will do. (Heads Up: When gluing on the leaves, make sure the giftee can still open their present!)\nParchment Paper Envelopes: Grab some scrap parchment paper leftover from cookie baking and get folding. Cut a square, then fold each corner into the center. Secure the corners with small sewn stitches or glue, then decorate the front as you see fit. We filled the envelopes with fabric scraps to hide the gifts within, then added leftover faux snow for a festive touch.\nThere you go — four delightful, greener ways to decorate your gifts with no paper gift wrap in sight.

{"id": "90", "text": "The 8 Best Pieces of Advice Top Nutritionists Ever Received\nEver wonder what the absolute best jewel of advice nutritionists ever got from their mentors, professors, peers and even friends and family? So did we. When it comes to empowering yourself to eat healthy and feel energized, nutritionists have no shortage of amazing deets (and perhaps some outdated nutrition advice they wish you would skip already!). We tapped top RDs to dish out the best piece of food-related guidance they ever received. So go ahead, enjoy that nutrient-brimming PM snack and read on…\n1. The most empowering way to take control of your health is to cook your own food! “The only way to know exactly what you are putting into your body is to be the person who selects the ingredients and the way the food is prepared. Having curiosity for why a food is nutritious or tastes good is inspiring and is what will keep [you] motivated to make the best eating choices. Nutrition is more than just calories — it is our small everyday choices that eventually lead to an accumulated lifetime of good nutrition,” says Rebecca Lewis, RD for HelloFresh, a leading healthy meal delivery kit company available nationwide, who says her mom and Michael Pollan have both been her biggest inspirations and teachers.\n2. Nutrition is not just about nutrients. “Knowing the function of vitamins and minerals and which foods they’re found in is just one small part of nutrition. We don’t eat nutrients in isolation; we eat food, and sometimes complex meals,” says Kayleen St. John, RD, Executive Director of Nutrition and Strategic Development of Euphebe, sharing a piece of sage advice she picked up from a colleague, Laura Rosenberg. “Knowing that broccoli contains vitamin C is one thing, but being able to communicate why this matters and how to make a delicious meal containing broccoli is a different matter entirely.”\n3. Put fruits and veggies first. “The most important, useful and inarguable advice I have ever received (and therefore, pass along to my clients and audiences) is to focus on fruits and vegetables,”shares Julieanna Hever, a plant-based dietitian and author of The Vegiterranean Diet. “Every major health organization in the world agrees with it. Fruits and vegetables are the most nutrient-dense, calorie-poor and health-promoting foods we have. Yet, fewer than 10 percent of Americans consume the minimum recommended intake.” Need to load up on more? Here are 11 recipes you’ll never know are filled with vegetables.\n4. You can only take people as far as you have gone. “One of my nutrition counseling mentors and author Evelyn Tribole said this to encourage me to do my own work on self-acceptance and body image if I was going to be helpful to others learning to reject dieting in favor of intuitive eating,” offers Rebecca Scritchfield, RDN, author of the upcoming book, Body Kindness. Hallelujah to that attitude!\n5. Food is more than just nutrition and numbers. “It connects us to our bodies and how it makes us feel both physically and emotionally (happy, strong, sad, tired, etc…). It helps create an opportunity to slow down and intimately bond with the people we share a meal with (friends, family, co-workers). It educates us about the farmers that dedicate their lives to raise, grow and produce the food for our world. And lastly, food crosses all cultural barriers to help us develop compassion and common ground even with those that are different than us,” shares Lewis. Think of your favorite memories in life — chances are, more than a handful involve being gathered around a table.\n6. Don’t pay attention to food labels. Short and sweet but oh-so-true: “Ignore everything on the food label other than ingredients. Everything else is simply marketing,” cautions Hever. Curious to learn more? Check out nine techy ways to learn what’s really in your food.\n7. It’s okay to have different views than “experts.” “The field of nutrition and the science that supports it is constantly evolving. Some of the most educated and brightest folks in the nutrition field disagree on what precisely constitutes a ‘healthy diet,'” says St. John, who learned this lesson from a professor at New York University, Dr. Kathleen Woolf. “It’s okay to have different opinions than others, just know where your opinions come from (beyond that you heard someone else say it!). Read articles and research constantly, and always ask why.”\n8. Make healthy food taste good. “My culinary she-ro, celebrity chef and author Ellie Krieger, reminded me that people care about taste, first and foremost,” reveals Scritchfield. “I realized that instead of being the ‘food police,’ I should use ingredients like butter, salt and sugar to enhance the flavor and enjoyment of foods to help make it easier to eat healthy for a lifetime.” Now, if you’ll excuse us, we’re off to make healthy brownies (you’ll never know we slipped black beans in ’em!)…\nWhat’s your favorite piece of healthy eating advice you’ve ever gotten?

Clarifī-FW helps to clear cloudy water by using electrical charges to bind these particles together so that the resulting larger and heavier particles can be more easily filtered out or removed by siphoning.\nInstructions & Guidelines\nDo not use in marine aquaria; instead, use Clarifī-SW. Extensive research in our facility has revealed that maximum performance in freshwater and saltwater aquaria is achieved with different active ingredients rather than with one ingredient that is compatible in both types of aquaria. The active ingredients in Clarifī-FW are incompatible with marine aquaria.\nShake bottle prior to use. Do not \"free pour\" into aquarium, which may result in excessive, persistent cloudiness. Flocculation of cloudiness due to blooms of microalgae may result in a depressed pH as the production of oxygen and uptake of carbon dioxide decrease; therefore, ensure that alkalinity measures at least 2 dKH prior to use and do not dose after display lights have turned off for the day (this is the period of time in which pH levels naturally decrease slightly, and an additional decrease in pH due to the afore-mentioned process may be stressful to aquarium inhabitants).\nReplace or rinse mechanical filtration material prior to use; when filtration media nears capacity (signified by a significant decrease in water flow through the exhaust of the power filter, or pooling of water above horizontally-situated filter pad material), replace or rinse it, and repeat as necessary.\nRecommended dosage is ~1-ml of Clarifī-FW per 10 US-gallons (37.9 L). Dilute up to 10-ml of Clarifī-FW per 8 fl-oz. or 250-ml of purified water and stir to disperse; gradually pour the resultant solution into the aquarium in an area of rapid water flow. Allow at least 12-hours for flocculation process to complete; re-apply in 24-hours if necessary. Maximum recommended usage is twice per 5 day period. Reoccurrence of cloudy water after Clarifī-FW has been employed to satisfactorily clarify water is an indication that issues referred to in Technical Background (opposite panel) may need to be addressed. The long-term successful care of aquaria relies upon the employment of sound husbandry principles.\nClarifī-FW is not formulated to remedy water discoloration (e.g. \"yellow\" tint) caused by dissolved organic material; instead, employ activated carbon (e.g. Brightwell Aquatics Carbonīt-P) and/or macroadsorptive resin (e.g. Brightwell Aquatics OrganītR) for this purpose.\nCaution: Do not use in marine aquaria; do not use at night.

Thousands of people are dying from pollution. People are living with cancer [because of air pollution].\"\nHe said campaigners should focus on the immediate effects of polluting the environment, because that resonates with the public in a way that distant visions of future harms do not.

His successor, the Democrat Jerry Brown, joined him in Paris in calling for action on emissions. \"The Paris conference is the biggest leap forward in dealing with climate change. France has been instrumental in advancing this agenda,\" he told the Guardian.\nSchwarzenegger said such joint efforts from both sides of the US political divide were essential to making progress on environmental problems. \"I never paid much attention to [political] parties,\" he said. \"This is a people's issue, not a party issue.\"\nHe said that \"sub-national\" authorities, such as state governors and assemblies in the US, and regional and city governments, could play an important role in bringing down greenhouse gas emissions, by taking their own initiatives independently of national governments.\n\"It is good that this is now being recognised,\" he said. \"It's about [emphasising] efficiency, and alternatives [to fossil fuels].\"\nCalifornia under successive administrations has brought forward a series of measures on air pollution and greenhouse gases, including a pioneering regional cap-and-trade system for carbon.

In fact, 49 percent of consumers reported they relied on influencer recommendations, according to a report from Linqia.\nWhen choosing an influencer to work with, have a firm grasp of your objectives. There are thousands of influencers to choose from in every space, so you want to partner with the right one for your business.\nGeoff Crain, senior director of sales and marketing at Kingstar Media, recommends checking for fake followers and low engagement first, then seeing who has an authoritative voice in the space you’re looking to advertise in.\n“For example,” he said, “if you are interested in increasing business in the fitness world, find influencers who are personal trainers or own their own gyms. Their followers engage with their content because they trust their voice to be legitimate when discussing the category in which they are experts.”\nFlaherty added that asking for referrals is a great way to ensure you’re working with an effective influencer. “Not every influencer is the right influencer,” he said. “It depends greatly on your specific budget, your target market. Ask for referrals from other relevant businesses you know who use influencers.”\nMeasuring the results of an influencer social media campaign might take a little extra planning.

The County Council will be able to hold a stock of kits and order additional kits, as needed, up to a maximum of 80,000 per week. The lateral flow kits are designed for use in asymptomatic testing. We are working up a plan to deploy them. Likely uses include mass testing in defined areas (eg. those wards associated with the highest rate of cases), to support care home visiting policies or in outbreak situations such as a workplace requiring whole workforce testing.\nSince Tuesday the local rate of cases has increased markedly, standing at above 320/100,000 population today. This is significantly above the national average and has increased more quickly than increases in the national rate. Rates across the County in the 17-21’s are significantly higher than the national average. These increases may be a result of a ‘last hurrah’ before lockdown, although this does not explain why Leicestershire has been disproportionately affected.\nImpact on Schools (previous week’s figures shown in brackets)\n- Since the beginning of term there have been 650 (524) cases across 186 (170) schools affecting 426 (354) children and 224 (170) staff.\n- Attendance across all schools was 85.5% (87.4%), including Covid-related absence.\n- The ability of some schools to remain open due to staff illness or isolation and physical restrictions affecting the provision of Covid-secure capacity is an increasing concern.\n- 616 early years settings were open at the start of the week with 8,644 children attending. It is predominantly childminders who have had to remain closed.\n- There have been Covid-related cases in early years settings affecting 52 children and 69 staff.\n- 114 (66%) care homes in the County have reported an outbreak of Covid-19. 22 (13%) homes have ongoing situations, an increase of 30% on last week. Testing results show 1.2% of residents tested positive, double the previous week, and 0.5% of staff tested positive.\n- There are 3 care homes where there is a significant outbreak affecting larger numbers of both staff and residents – outbreaks are being contained and specialist teams are providing advice.\n- Currently there are no designated care homes for people who are Covid-positive on discharge from hospital in the County but residents can access one care home in the City.\n- A new care home visitor policy will be published shortly to take account of Government guidance.\n- Day services risk assessments are being undertaken to determine what services can be safely provided. 60% of people have returned to services, and 19% of people do not wish to do so. Recent outbreaks have unfortunately resulted in closure of some services.\nFREE SCHOOL MEALS AND OTHER FUNDING SUPPORT\nConfirmation has been received that the Government will provide funding that can be used for free school meals to the end of the financial year. The Department for Work and Pensions states in respect of eligibility:\n“County Councils and Unitary Authorities will determine eligibility in their area and target their support within the scope of the conditions set out below:\n· at least 80% of the total funding will be ring-fenced to support families with children, with up to 20% of the total funding to other types of households, including individuals.\n· at least 80% of the total funding will be ring-fenced to provide support with food, energy and water bills (including sewerage), with up to 20% on other items.”\nThe County Council’s allocation is £1,462,000.\nThe Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) (England) (No 4) Regulations 2020 came into force on 5th November. The Secretary of State has enabled all local authorities in England to enforce Part 4 of the Regulations which deals with closure of and restrictions on businesses.

The Police continue to lead on enforcement for breaches of the requirements placed on individuals and gatherings and both upper and lower tier local authorities continue to lead in relation to the obligations placed on businesses. However, it is recognised that there are inextricably linked incidents crossing all the regulatory requirements.

A memorandum of understanding is in place to enable all agencies to share information to deliver a more collaborative, intelligence led enforcement response, with all partners adopting 'the 4 Es': Engage. Explain. Encourage.

These directions are now revoked. However, as we approach the automatic lifting of restrictions, Trading Standards officers will be engaging with these and other businesses to ensure appropriate measures are in place, in readiness for a reopening of businesses across the County when the lockdown is lifted.\nThe Trading Standards Service is seeking to improve the quality of the data obtained from the district councils.

We need to keep in mind the goal of all economic activity: satisfying the wants and needs of consumers.”\nBy C. Kenneth Reeder\nThe pipeline battle rages on. On the pro-pipeline side, the argument revolves mainly around economics. And a big part of that argument is: pipelines create jobs.\nIt’s true that it takes a lot of workers to build, operate and maintain a major pipeline.\nAnd it’s understandable why politicians and industry make their case in terms of job creation. Voters like jobs, after all.\nBut this is bad economics. All too often our public discourse treats employment as an end in itself.\nThis is a big mistake.\nIf we say the merit of building pipelines comes from the jobs created, then we have stepped into a trap. This trap opens the door for the government to throw taxpayer money at a project even when it no longer serves the interest of the marketplace.\nAll for the sake of protecting “jobs.”\nAnd indeed, this is what is happening. The Notley and Trudeau governments in Alberta and Ottawa have declared that they will provide a tax-funded safety net for investors in the highly controversial Trans Mountain pipeline expansion project.\nWe see this argument come up whenever governments need to justify a bailout of some kind.\nHarper’s government bailed out the auto industry for the sake of jobs. Trudeau’s government bailed out Bombardier for the sake of jobs. And so on.\nSo if not jobs, what is the proper economic justification for building pipelines?\nWe need to keep in mind the goal of all economic activity: satisfying the wants and needs of consumers.\n(And remember: we’re all consumers, and even the most radical anti-oil environmentalists find it impossible to forsake the bounties of petroleum in their day-to-day lives).\nPipelines provide an efficient way to move goods to where they are more valuable and thus more effectively satisfy consumers than otherwise.\nWe frequently hear about the discount applied to Canadian crude due to strained transportation capacity and limited market access. Canadian heavy crude—which can be refined into a multitude of useful products—typically trades at a 25- to 30-per-cent discount off the West Texas Intermediate benchmark.\nThe severity of this discount reflects the fact that Canadian producers cannot get the most capable and urgent buyers for their product. New pipelines help address this problem.\nThat is the real key to the case for pipelines—increasing the capability to move energy products to where they are most needed.\nEven if a major pipeline project only created a single job, it would still be worthwhile because of the service it provides in ultimately getting goods to consumers more efficiently.\nOnly jobs that arise to serve the needs of consumers are desirable and can increase our standard of living. When the government throws money at something to “create” or “save” jobs, it ultimately makes everybody poorer.\nMany jobs actually make society poorer. There is an old nerdy economist joke that mocks the idea of jobs for the sake of jobs, by absurdly proposing that the government hire folks to dig holes and refill them over and over.\nMost people recognize that this would be pointless and keep people from finding useful jobs. But that is the logical path we walk if we think of jobs as an end in themselves.\nNow consider the Trans Mountain situation.\nIf Kinder Morgan abandons the Trans Mountain project, that is a strong indication that it would not represent an effective way to serve consumers, due to political and regulatory interference. It might be better that they allocate capital to other projects without such opposition.\nIf they did this, it would be a strong indication that throwing taxpayer money at the problem for the sake of “jobs” would be a huge mistake. If people don’t want to put their own capital into a project—put their own skin in the game, so to speak—then it makes little sense for the government to step in and throw other people’s money at it.\nResources are limited. We cannot have our cake and eat it too. We have to remember that some jobs must be destroyed for the government to subsidize other jobs. We want jobs that the market deems valuable for the sake of helping consumers, not jobs for the sake of jobs, regardless of the lack of value created.\nLet’s build pipelines. Lots of pipelines. But let’s not do so because of jobs. Let’s do it to benefit consumers who need affordable energy to have a good life.\nC.

{"id": "112", "text": "Now with over 90 strains of weed and The Serenity Room\nWashr Online Laundromat in Cape Town\nThe cyber pick-up and delivery service that’s revolutionising the way we clean our clothes\nOne of life’s greatest schleps is doing the dirty washing. It’s a relentless, soul-sucking chore that spins all the fun out of a potentially great day and sponges up valuable time that could be used doing more important things, like for instance, knocking back a beer or squeezing in an afternoon snooze.\nFiddling around on your iPhone, Galaxy S5 or Apple Mac, however, is more heaven than hassle. So, three Mother City-based digital entrepreneurs weighed these two facts against each other and, after some deliberation and a look at successful overseas operations (like Washio), decided to launch Washr, South Africa’s first online laundromat, to make life a little easier for locals.\n“Everyone needs to get laundry done at least once or twice a week,” asserts co-founder David Shleifman, “so we decided to do something that could free people up from this undesirable household chore so that they can have more time to relax or focus on work.”\nTo benefit from the convenience of this mobile-friendly e-service, all that Capetonians have to do is visit the venture’s super user-friendly website (Washr.co.za) on a PC or smartphone, register by filling out a short form and then place an order, specifying the date, time and place they’d like their dirty clothes to be collected. A driver will then arrive at the requested location within the chosen hour slot to collect the laundry and whip it off to be washed, dried and folded, and within the next 24 hours, garments will be returned to the specified address, smelling fresh and looking spotless (the turnaround time is only longer than 24 hours for complex dry cleaning requests).\nPick-up and delivery is 100% free, and all orders are on demand, which means that if you want your socks and undies rinsed right now, Washr will be at your doorstep within two hours of the order being placed, so you don’t have to recycle old items day after day until you have the time to wash them on the weekend.\nThe touch-of-a-button business, which has been billed as the ‘Uber for laundry’, currently services busy urbanites based in the CBD, on the Atlantic Seaboard or in the Southern Suburbs and will soon expand to other areas too. It only works with reputable, eco-friendly laundromats in and around Cape Town and will wash and dry clean absolutely anything that can be washed or dry cleaned, from work shirts, winter coats and evening dresses to sleeping bags, double-bed duvets, curtains and carpets. Customers can also make a note on the online form if they want a specific item to be ironed or to receive special care.\nAnd the cherry on the proverbial cake? When clean clothes are delivered to your office space or home, the neatly folded package comes complete with a chocolate or cookie of some kind – a nice little touch that speaks volumes for the personal service that this Mother City start-up promises.\nAside from the surprise treat though, it’s the click-of-a-button convenience that makes this cyber washroom so wonderfully appealing. It’s definitely going some way towards saving critical beer-drinking time and lessening the dullness of domestic life.\nTip: Washr is offering all CapeTownMagazine.com readers 10% off their first laundry load. Simply insert the voucher code CPTMAG10 into the ‘Extra Info’ box when placing your order.\nThe Bill: Rates are slightly more expensive than those at conventional laundromats, but they’re still fair considering that pick-up and drop-off is free. A standard wash and fold costs R24p/kg (5kg is the minimum weight), and all other prices are clearly marked on Washr’s website. Payment is also very easy: patrons receive an invoice via email an hour or two before their clothes are dropped off and they can then pay with cash or via an EFT or SnapScan. Remember, CapeTownMagazine.com readers get 10% off their first load (see the tip above).\nOpening Hours: Monday – Friday: 7am – 8pm; Saturday – Sunday: 9am – 12pm (customers can obviously make laundry requests at any time, but these are the hours during which orders are processed)\nKeen on buying all your products and services in cyberspace? Have a look at our overview of online stores in South Africa.\nUse our events section for an up-to-date overview of happenings in Cape Town.

I had full intention to bring it home to him but I also thought, \"He'd never know.\"\nThe cute, little cupcake DID make it home, but there was a much sweeter lesson in this cookie monster scenario.\nThough we may have full intent to do the right thing, sometimes we get side tracked with what we see with our fleshy, googly eyes.

{"id": "119", "text": "What is a pre-sale?\nOne consideration to a new home or condo purchase is the ability to purchase a pre-sale property. You may have heard of this term before, it is defined as “a sale held or made before an item is made generally available for purchase”. This means that you are essentially reserving your home and sale price, guaranteed with a non-refundable reservation fee, until the time comes to write the purchase contract, and that timing can vary by builder and project.\nWhy buy pre-sale?\nGenerally there will be a larger selection of suites to choose from in the pre-selling phase as many new home buyers prefer to wait until construction is further along to purchase. You will have to rely on builder floorplans and images to envision your space, and luckily with Carrington Communities, you can visit a variety of showsuites and condos throughout Edmonton to get a good understanding of the space you are reserving.\nPre-sale condos are unfinished condos, so with Carrington that means you have the chance to choose your interior finishing selections or packages, including cabinets, flooring, backsplashes, and lighting. This gives you a personalized design that fits your needs, style and personality.\nAnother advantage of buying during the pre-sale phase is that you will have time to save up and anticipate your closing costs. You are only required to put down a reservation fee (the amount can vary between projects), this is much lower than your required 5% downpayment giving you additional time to save up and also put aside some of the closing costs you need.\nSo if you can use a bit of creativity and imagination buying pre-sale gives you the opportunity to secure the condo of your dreams early on!\nAre pre-sale prices lower?\nMarket conditions dictate new home prices, so it really depends on when you buy. With Edmonton’s ideal housing prices you may have the opportunity to build some equity before you even move in, but that will depend on a lot of other factors down the road as future market conditions cannot be guaranteed.\nOne thing to consider is your mortgage approval, you will need to wait until you have entered a contract to fully secure your mortgage rate. You should still get pre-approved so that you can be confident you will be able to afford your new home when the time comes. With Carrington and our trusted mortgage partner Ownest Financial it is easy to get pre-approved, all from the comfort of your home.\nWhere can I learn more?\nVisit our communities currently in the pre-sale stage, including Edge and Elan, both in southwest Edmonton. Our experienced sales associates can guide you through the process from pre-sale to contract to possession.", "scores": {"score": 1}}

{"id": "2", "text": "As fun as craps can get, to truly enjoy the game and avoid any potential faux pas, it’s important to understand the craps etiquette at the table.\nIn this guide I will walk you through the do’s and don’ts of craps etiquette.\nLet’s get started!\n1. Never Hand Cash to the Dealer\nIn a game of craps, it’s important to remember that you should never hand cash directly to the dealer.\nThis isn’t a personal slight, but rather a standard casino rule.\nIf you want to buy-in, wait for a pause between rolls, place your cash on the table, make eye contact with the dealer, and say, “Change, please.”\n2. Keep the Dice Visible\nWhen you’re the shooter (the person rolling the dice), always keep the dice visible. Don’t remove them from the table or hide them from the dealer.\nThis is to ensure fair play and maintain the integrity of the game.\n3. Don’t Buy-in During a Roll\nNever attempt to buy-in or exchange cash for chips when the shooter has the dice. Wait for the dealer to indicate when it’s okay to place bets and when you should not.\nIf you’re playing, ensure the dealer confirms any bet you’re trying to place before the shooter rolls the dice.\n4. Respect the Pace of the Game\nAs the shooter, you control the pace of the game. When it’s your turn, just shoot the dice. Avoid unnecessary delays, such as blowing on the dice, which can also spread germs.\nIf you don’t feel like shooting, you can always “pass right” and let the next player take their turn.\n5. Passing Right\nIf you don’t want to shoot, it’s perfectly acceptable to pass the dice to the player on your right.\nTo do this, open your hand with the dice in your palm and indicate them towards the next player in a clockwise manner.\n6. Hands High\nWhen the dealer says, “Hands high” or “the dice are out”, lift your hands off the table.\nThis ensures you’re not interfering with the play and the dice can be passed to the shooter without obstruction.\n7. Be Respectful to Other Players\nGood manners are essential at the craps table.\nAvoid hanging your hands over the edge of the rail or resting drinks on the rail. Excessive drinking can lead to disruptive behavior, so it’s best to drink responsibly.\nKeep the table clean and free from drinks and cigarette ashes.\n8. Ask the Dealer for Help\nIf you’re unsure about the different bets or any aspect of the game, feel free to ask the dealer for help. However, don’t rely on the dealer to coach you throughout the game.\nThe craps table can get crowded, and dealers need to focus on managing the game.\n9. Don’t Forget to Tip\nTipping the dealer is a common courtesy, regardless of whether you win or lose. Never hand a dealer money directly.\nInstead, place money or chips on the table for tipping purposes and clearly state what the money is for. You can also place a bet for your dealer as a tip.\nCraps is an exciting and engaging game that brings together people from all walks of life.\nUnderstanding and practicing proper craps etiquette not only enhances your gaming experience but also contributes to a friendly and respectful atmosphere at the table.\nRemember, the goal is to have fun and enjoy the game.\nBy following these craps etiquette guidelines, you’ll be able to participate in the game smoothly, make new friends, and create memorable experiences.\nSo, whether you’re a seasoned player or a newbie, step up to the craps table with confidence and respect, and let the good times roll!", "scores": {"score": 1}}

{"id": "6", "text": "F1: Raikkonen Cruises to Melbourne WinFittingly for the man deemed as Michael Schumacher's successor at Ferrari, Kimi Raikkonen began his Scuderia career in dominating fashion, leading from lights to flag in the Australian Grand Prix season opener at Melbourne's Albert Park circuit.\nAfter easing his pace near the end, the Finn crossed the finish line 7.2 seconds ahead of reigning double world champion Fernando Alonso. The Spaniard's rookie McLaren teammate, Lewis Hamilton, completed his impressive debut weekend with a podium.\nHamilton was one of the stars of a race that saw most of the action take place behind the leaders. The Briton, fourth on the grid, jumped to third at the start as Alonso was forced to back off and dropped to P4 while fighting with Nick Heidfeld's BMW for second place.\nAt the end of trouble-free first lap - Anthony Davidson's Super Aguri seemed to stall at the start, but the former Honda tester was able to continue -Raikkonen already led Heidfeld by 1.2sec, with Hamilton, Alonso, Robert Kubica in the second BMW, Renault's Giancarlo Fisichella, Red Bull's Mark Webber and Toyota's Ralf Schumacher rounding out the top-eight.\nRaikkonen's teammate Felipe Massa gained four spots at the start, moving up to 18th. The Brazilian had started last, after qualifying 16th due to gearbox problems, then losing 10 grid spots with an engine-change penalty.\nDespite being on hard tires versus Heidfeld's soft compound - as a novelty in the 2007 regulations, drivers are obligated to use both tire variations during the race - Raikkonen had no trouble in pulling away from the German in a rate of over half a second per lap. By the time Heidfeld kicked off the first round of pitstops for the frontrunners, on lap 14, he trailed Raikkonen by over eight seconds.\nBefore that, however, Christijan Albers had the dubious honor of being the first driver to retire in the 2007 season, and in a bizarre manner. The Dutch driver missed a braking zone inexplicably, crashing his Spyker against the tire barriers. Afterwards, Albers admitted he got distracted while adjusting the car's radio.\nMeanwhile Massa's recovery drive came to a halt when he reached the 16th spot and the Hondas of Jenson Button and Rubens Barrichello. The Briton, with a heavy fuel load, slowed down both Brazilians for eight laps before being overtaken by Barrichello on lap 14 and by Massa two laps later.\nCatch up on the latest Formula 1 developments each month in RACER. Check out our look at how Kimi Raikkonen settled in at Ferrari over the winter in our April issue, on sale now!\nRaikkonen pitted early, on the 18th lap, giving Hamilton the opportunity to lead five laps on his maiden race. The rookie came in on the 23rd, one lap after teammate Alonso, and the top-three positions remained unchanged. Heidfeld was the biggest loser in the initial round of stops, dropping to fifth, behind teammate Kubica.\nMassa, for his part, didn't pit until the 29th of 58 laps, giving away a one-stop strategy to make up for the lost time. Button's miserable weekend continued in the meantime, with the Honda man being awarded a drive-through penalty for pitlane speeding. On the same lap, American Scott Speed, who ran as high as 17th, had to park his Toro Rosso after an off due to tire problems.\nEight laps later, Kubica's fine run came to an end when he drove his BMW into the garage with gearbox problems, an issue that had plagued the Swiss-German team all through winter testing.\nAnother top-team newbie wasn't having as much of a stellar run: after a couple of brief offs, Renault's Heikki Kovalainen spun but managed to rejoin on lap 41.\nAlso spinning on lap 44, when the second round of pit stops was under way, was local favorite Mark Webber, who managed the feat while entering the pits. The Australian lost time, but was able to continue unscathed. Ditto for Raikkonen, whose tranquil run was spiced up by a small off-road excursion on lap 47.\nThe second round of pits produced the final main change in the order, as Alonso was able to emerge of the boxes ahead of Hamilton to gain P2. From then on, the only piece of headlining action came from a dive-bomb move by Red Bull's David Coulthard on Alex Wurz's Williams on lap 51 in a fight for the 13th spot. The Scot's overly optimistic maneuver on the inside caused both cars to touch wheels, launching DC's RB3, which just barely missed running over Wurz's helmet. Both men retired at the spot.\nSeven laps later, Raikkonen crossed the finish line for his first win since 2005. Heidfeld rallied to finish fourth, ahead of Fisichella, who fended off a last-gasp attack by Massa, the Brazilian's one-stop strategy paying off with a P6 finish. Williams' Nico Rosberg and Ralf Schumacher in the Toyota took the remaining Australian GP points.\n\"It wasn't as easy as it seemed, but we had a plan and followed it,\" Raikkonen said. \"\" We pushed hard on the opening laps and the car was perfect all day long. It's an excellent start to our season.\"\nDespite the defeat, Alonso was upbeat with the eight points hauled from Albert Park: \"We need to work harder if we are to win races, but we made the max out of the circumstances,\" the Spaniard felt. \"I had to focus on Heidfeld at the start and left room for Lewis to go, and that cost us. But it was a good fight.\"\nAn elated Hamilton, the first black driver to achieve the pinnacle of motorsport, celebrated a debut that, a couple of minor offs during the race aside, was nearly impeccable: \"Leading was fantastic, a fantastic feeling really. It was tough to have the champion behind me, but the team did an incredible job getting the car ready in the off-season. I don't know what happened on the second stop, I felt like it was a good stop, but in all it was a great experience.\"\nThe 2007 Formula 1 season resumes in three weeks' time with the Malaysian GP. The teams will arrive at the Kuala Lumpur venue one week before for a series of open tests.\n2007 Australian Grand Prix results.", "scores": {"score": 1}}
{"id": "7", "text": "How to find the right plan to fit your budget\nIt’s always a good idea to have dental insurance. Maintaining good oral health impacts your body’s overall health, so it’s important to know you can regularly access dental health services that are covered by a good insurance plan.\nLike any service or product, though, there are many options to choose from in the marketplace and it can be tricky to know which dental benefits plan is best for you. A good place to start is understanding the basics of dental insurance.\nDetermine your dental care needs\nThe first consideration is to determine your needs. If you are single and younger in age, the best dental plan for you will differ from that of a married couple with several children.\nCost of the dental insurance plan you choose will be determined by the type of plan that is chosen. While premiums for dental insurance are generally lower compared to conventional health insurance, dental plans generally cover 80% of costs on basic procedures such as treating cavities, removing teeth, and root canals. More serious procedures such as crowns and treatment of gum disease may only have 50% of costs covered.\nMost plans do cover 100% of preventative procedures such as teeth cleanings and X-rays.\nThree Types of Dental Insurance Plans\n- Indemnity or fee-for-service plans are generally the most expensive type of coverage. They will offer the largest network of dental providers to choose from and insurers will generally put a cap on the costs they’ll cover for certain procedures. Additionally, it’s not uncommon for the patient to pay the entire cost for a procedure and then file a claim with the insurer, which will provide reimbursement upon approval of the claim.\n- Preferred provider organizations (PPO) are one of the most common types of plans available and feature a network of dentists who negotiate fees with the insurer, resulting in lower out-of-pocket fees for the patient. Patients are able to use a dentist outside of the established network of providers, but there is usually a higher cost.\n- Health maintenance organizations (HMO) are similar to PPOs in that dentists join a network of providers to provide services at reduced costs. However, in an HMO the networks are usually much smaller within a constrained geographic footprint. In some cases, there may be out-of-network services these plans will allow you to access at a reduced cost. While these are generally the cheapest dental insurance plans available, they are also the most limited.\nAccessing dental insurance plans\nMost people have access to dental insurance through their employer, however, insurance can also be secured through group coverage programs that might include the Affordable Care Act Marketplace or government programs such as Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP).\nThe alternative to group coverage plans is purchasing an individual plan, which can be more expensive. These plans can also be more limited in the type of procedures that are covered and there’s sometimes a waiting period of anywhere between a few months to a year before major procedures will be covered.\nWhen considering an individual dental plan, it may also be worth implementing a Health Savings Account (HSA), which can be used to set aside funds to cover costs of procedures that the plan may not cover.\nRegardless of the dental insurance plan chosen, it is important to check on whether it is accepted by your dentist. If the plan is an HMO or PPO, it’s also important to determine if the dentist is within the network of those plans.\nAssociated Dentists is Here to Help\nIf you need any assistance understanding your dental insurance benefits or would like to inform us of any changes to your coverage, reach out to our in-house insurance department at our Madison and Verona locations.", "scores": {"score": 2}}

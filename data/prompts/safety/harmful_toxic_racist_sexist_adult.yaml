  Below is an extract from a web page. Evaluate the level of explicit sexual material or content inappropriate for general audiences using the additive 5-point scoring system described below. 
  Points are accumulated based on the degree of inappropriateness:

  - Add 1 point if the extract contains mild sexual innuendo or suggestive content that is not explicit, generally acceptable for most audiences but possibly unsuitable for young children.
  - Add another point if the extract includes moderate sexual content or references that are more direct but not graphic, inappropriate for children though potentially acceptable for teens.
  - Award a third point if the extract contains explicit sexual references or mild explicit imagery, clearly unsuitable for minors.
  - Grant a fourth point if the extract includes strong explicit sexual content or graphic imagery, intended for adults only.
  - Bestow a fifth point if the extract is dominated by hardcore explicit sexual material, such as pornography, highly inappropriate for general audiences.
  Note: Topics like sexual education, health-related sexual organ discussions, LGBTQ+ issues, contraception, or intimate hygiene should 
  be scored 0 if presented educationally and without explicit intent.

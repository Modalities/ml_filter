{"text":"EFT is a form of psychological acupressure, based on the same energy meridians used in traditional acupuncture to treat physical and emotional ailments\nfor over 5,000 years, but without the invasiveness of needles.

{"text":"In Computational intelligence and neuroscience\nDiabetes is a chronic disease that can cause several forms of chronic damage to the human body, including heart problems, kidney failure, depression, eye damage, and nerve damage. There are several risk factors involved in causing this disease, with some of the most common being obesity, age, insulin resistance, and hypertension. Therefore, early detection of these risk factors is vital in helping patients reverse diabetes from the early stage to live healthy lives. Machine learning (ML) is a useful tool that can easily detect diabetes from several risk factors and, based on the findings, provide a decision-based model that can help in diagnosing the disease. This study aims to detect the risk factors of diabetes using ML methods and to provide a decision support system for medical practitioners that can help them in diagnosing diabetes. Moreover, besides various other preprocessing steps, this study has used the synthetic minority over-sampling technique integrated with the edited nearest neighbor (SMOTE-ENN) method for balancing the BRFSS dataset. The SMOTE-ENN is a more powerful method than the individual SMOTE method. Several ML methods were applied to the processed BRFSS dataset and built prediction models for detecting the risk factors that can help in diagnosing diabetes patients in the early stage. The prediction models were evaluated using various measures that show the high performance of the models. The experimental results show the reliability of the proposed models, demonstrating that k-nearest neighbor (KNN) outperformed other methods with an accuracy of 98.38%, sensitivity, specificity, and ROC\/AUC score of 98%. Moreover, compared with the existing state-of-the-art methods, the results confirm the efficacy of the proposed models in terms of accuracy and other evaluation measures. The use of SMOTE-ENN is more beneficial for balancing the dataset to build more accurate prediction models. This was the main reason it was possible to achieve models more accurate than the existing ones.\nUllah Zahid, Saleem Farrukh, Jamjoom Mona, Fakieh Bahjat, Kateb Faris, Ali Abdullah Marish, Shah Babar","metadata":{"date":1708997298000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947474669.36\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240226225941-20240227015941-00698.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9423106909,"token_count":435,"url":"http:\/\/doctorpenguin.com\/2022-10-11_13_summary\/"},"score":3,"id":"1"}

{"text":"Are you getting tired of looking for the signs yet? Are you growing weary of searching through YouTube channels, Facebook, Twitter, and all the other venues of the internet to see the next sure sign that the Lord is coming back soon, looking for the next event that will \u201ccap off\u201d all the others. \u201cAnd then if any man shall say to you, Lo, here is Christ; or, lo, he is there; believe him not.\u201d (Mark 13:21)\nThis is part of the reason for some of the signs we are seeing, so that those who do not desire to be about the business that they are supposed to be doing will be drawn away by not only false signs, but false Christs. So far the main body of material seems to be floods, fires, and sinkholes, but the advent of beings from outer space is also beginning to creep into the images and news stories that are captivating the minds of those who seem to say no more than \u201cHe is coming back soon!\u201d Yes, He is, but what are you doing to show a lost world what they need to do before He does.\nThese items are going to be drawing more and more people away as they increase in frequency, for they will look to and for the signs as proof of the coming event, and in far too many cases these same individuals will be doing little more than that, just looking. Once the fires die down and the waters flow less through the streets of the cities, these same individuals will begin to look elsewhere, as stated, the coming alien invasion seems to be permeating quite a bit of these \u201cnews\u201d broadcasts, volcanoes and earthquakes of course will fit into the \u201dprophetic\u201d warnings, but if you will recall, our Lord said that he would return for us, \u201cFor in such an hour as ye think not the Son of man cometh.\u201d (Matt. 24:44)\nWhat will be next then, someone doing \u201cmiracles\u201d that some believe could only be attributed to God? Many will fall prey to that great deceit, the Roman Catholic Church has been a great \u201cpurveyor,\u201d if you will, of so-called visible miracles for quite some time, it is a good way to keep the masses in check, to keep the \u201cobedience through the possibility of persecution\u201d continuing, so it would not surprise me if we begin to see a few false signs coming from that direction. Some will say the so-called pandemic is a sure sign, but these have done very little research into the factual evidence, others will point to the coming global economic crisis, the great worldwide famines that are inevitable, the cashless society, or perhaps the advent of artificial intelligence that soon Christ will take His church out, (1 Thess. 4:17)\nHere is the point my friends, what difference should it make to any of us, to any born-again believer when the Lord comes back, how exactly is that going to change in one bit what you should be doing and what you were supposed to be accomplishing for Him since the first day that you were saved from your sins? Haven\u2019t you been warning the lost all this time anyway, haven\u2019t you been telling them of His love, grace, and mercy since the day you got off your knees at the cross? Did you really need all these signs to \u201ckick start\u201d your faith, your obedience to what you are supposed to be doing even without them?\nHere is the next trap of our adversary that so many have already fallen into, spending far too much time looking at the signs, searching for the next one, and not bringing into the conversation the need for repentance to a lost world, and not just so these people that will listen will miss the tribulation period, but so they will avert an eternity of pain and great suffering, so that they also can come to the knowledge of the grace of God that is available through Jesus Christ.\nWill some perhaps listen a little more intently when you expound to them the truths of the Scriptures in relation to these days, perhaps, but how many will make a true confession of faith and how many will only be trapped by the same emotional construct that is affecting so many others these days, only to fall away when a specific period of peaceful times ensue. Are we in the last days? We have been since our Lord went back to the Father. Are we in the last of the last days, or how about nearing the end of the last of the very last days, how many adjectives would you like to add here. Recall what the two angels said to those who were standing around looking up at the sky for who knows how long after that moment. \u201cYe men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven? this same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven.\u201d (Acts 1:11)\nAre you doing the same, is all you do any more in relation to the words in this letter to you is to search high and low for the next sign of His imminent return, wondering to yourself \u201cThis is it!\u201d To put it bluntly my brothers and sisters, get back to work, keep your eyes on the prize that is Christ, reprove, rebuke, lift up your brothers and sisters in Christ, love you neighbor, take a glance occasionally at what is happening around the planet, but don\u2019t sit there staring at the sky all day, you have a job you are supposed to be doing. \u201cWherefore comfort one another with these words.\u201d (1 Thess. 4:18) And then get back to work.","metadata":{"date":1708886115000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947474641.34\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240225171204-20240225201204-00798.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.972667098,"token_count":1196,"url":"https:\/\/www.borrowedtruths.com\/get-back-to-work\/"},"score":0,"id":"5"}
{"text":"If you tune in and listen to the \u2018Drive Show\u2019 that airs on Radio Maisha every Monday to Friday from 4-7pm, then you are familiar with the voice of one Zulekha.\nZulekha is the show\u2019s comedian. If you\u2019ve ever wondered if a pretty girl can be funny, then you\u2019ve not met Zulekha. I must say she is talented. Together with her co-host Tina Koroso, they have managed to keep thousands of listeners glued to their show every drive time.\nWhen she is behind the mic, from time to time, she changes her tone of voice. From a deep Somali accented old woman to a young Meru lad, Zulekha has captured the attention of her listeners who are always left in stitches due to her jokes. But what is she like up close and candid?\nZulekha Akinyi Otieno is a striking woman, the kind that owns a room the minute she walks in. But there is also another side to her. She is down-to-earth. What many people may not know is that she is half Somali half Luo.\nBorn and brought up in Zimmerman in Nairobi, Zulekha had to endure a difficult childhood and the painful memories are still evident. \u201cI come from a single parent family. My mother shouldered the responsibility of raising us. I have two brothers and I am the middle child,\u201d says Zulekha.\n\u201cThe painful part is that my father was a drunkard. He cared less if we had eaten, had clothes to wear and even books to use while in school. His life was centered on the \u2018bottle\u2019 and many are the times he left us to go on his numerous drinking sprees,\u201d she says.\nNot having the zeal and strength to take it anymore, Zulekha says her mother decided that they shift and move to another place to start life on their own away from their father.\n\u201cWe had to flee. He didn\u2019t even know that we had shifted to another place. At that time, I was in class two at Roysambu Primary School. My mum was open with us and gave us two options. If anyone wished to stay behind with dad then they could and if we wanted to go with her, she was not going to stop us. My brothers and I decided to go stay with mum, through thick and thin,\u201d she bitterly recalls.\nHer dad would later die of throat cancer in 2004. \u201cDespite his bad lifestyle, he still made time to visit us when we shifted. I have never felt bitter towards my dad. Growing up, I told myself that there is no one who does not make mistakes in life.\nHe was still our dad and we still loved him,\u201d she says. They started their new life in Zimmerman but problems seemed to trail their way. Her mum couldn\u2019t raise the Sh2,500 needed for rent. To make ends meet, she started a small business of making and selling chips and bhajia.\nWhen she came back from school, Zulekha would assist in selling the foodstuffs. As fate would have it, in 2009, Zulekha fell pregnant. \u201cI realised I was pregnant at three months. I was devastated. I didn\u2019t know how I was going to break the news to my mum.\nThoughts of having an abortion rang in my head but on a second thought, I decided I was going to keep my baby,\u201d she says. Since it was hard for her to disclose the news to her mum, she decided to keep it to herself\n.\u201cMy mum began to notice changes in me when I was about eight months pregnant. She requested one of my aunts to come and talk to me. I had to tell her the truth. I could not hide it anymore. My mum was so devastated by the news.\nThis opened new challenges to our already stressing lives. She didn\u2019t even want to eat food I had cooked and most of the time she was crying that I also felt bad,\u201d she says. In November 2009, Zulekha gave birth to her son, Abdul Malik Otieno. This opened a new chapter in her life. She had to look for a job. She ventured into the entertainment industry in the same year and joined a popular programme that airs on one of the local channels.\nShe also tried her luck as a stand-up comedian in one of the local comic shows. \u201cIn 2012, I joined Kenya Kona comedy which used to air on KTN,\u201d she says. Her breakthrough came in August 2013 when she landed a job at Radio Maisha. She recounts that moment when that call came through.\n\u201cI was called by Radio Maisha head of radio Tom Japanni. He told me of how he had listened to me perform on the comedy shows and how I made people laugh at my jokes. He noticed my potential and requested me to visit the office which I did. Though I had never thought of joining radio, I decided to go for it,\u201d she says.\nZulekha officially went on air in September 2013 and as she puts it, it has been an amazing experience. \u201cMy main role in the show is to bring out the light side and not make things too serious. At drive time, everyone has had a long day from work and they just want to listen to something relaxing as they go home. They want to sit and listen to Zulekha who has to make them laugh,\u201d she says.\nIn the show, Zulekha acts as a fourty-something year old woman who doesn\u2019t take life too serious and has her own way of dealing with issues. \u201cIt\u2019s a character I love. As much as that woman is crazy, she fears God. I not only disturb my co-host but also the listeners,\u201d she adds.\nAs a comedenne, and a female comic for that matter, Zulekha says she has had her fair share of challenges in the industry, from being undermined on first instances to cases of her original jokes being performed by another well-established comedian.\n\u201cAll I can say is it has taken God\u2019s grace for me to break the ceiling in the world of comedy. Sometimes I walk out of studio after the show and can\u2019t believe I am the one who did that. My mum cries tears of joy when she listens to me. She is proud of my achievements,\u201d says Zulekha.\nAs the sole breadwinner in her family, she says: \u201cI have to work hard to remain vibrant, fresh and remain abreast with the daily happenings to ensure my jokes are educative and entertaining and make people laugh,\u201d she says.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not easy to be spontaneous every day. In the comedy industry, it is wrong to repeat what another comedian has said. It is a crime. But I strive to do my best. I use the opportunity I have been given not only to make people laugh, but also make them learn and change their lives.\u201d\nZulekha, however, regrets that many youth are wasting away in their homes yet they have talents that can earn them money. \u201cWhatever you can do, do it today and give it your best because you are not guaranteed of tomorrow.\nKeep fighting because nothing comes easy. I used to write a lot of jokes and keep them in the house not knowing what God planned for me. It is all about persistence,\u201d says Zulekha.","metadata":{"date":1708824882000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947474573.20\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240225003942-20240225033942-00299.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9898227453,"token_count":1610,"url":"https:\/\/www.standardmedia.co.ke\/evewoman\/living\/article\/2000148202\/comedian-zulekha-otienomaking-people-laugh-is-no-joke"},"score":1,"id":"6"}

They also contain lycopene, which is a powerful antioxidant that has been linked to a reduced risk of certain types of cancer.\nWhen incorporating cherry tomatoes into your diet, it's important to consider how they fit into your overall carbohydrate intake for the day. If you are following a low-carb or ketogenic diet, you may want to limit your serving size of cherry tomatoes or choose other low-carb vegetables instead.\nHere are a few tips for incorporating cherry tomatoes into your meals:\n- Add them to salads: Cherry tomatoes make a colorful and flavorful addition to any salad. Toss them with some leafy greens, a protein source like grilled chicken or tofu, and a low-carb dressing for a healthy and satisfying meal.\n- Roast them: Roasted cherry tomatoes have a sweet and concentrated flavor that is perfect for adding to pasta dishes or spreading on toast. Simply toss them in olive oil, season with salt and pepper, and roast in the oven until they are soft and caramelized.\n- Snack on them: Cherry tomatoes make a great snack on their own or paired with some protein-rich cheese or hummus. They are portable and easy to eat, making them a convenient option for on-the-go snacking.\nOverall, cherry tomatoes are a delicious and nutritious addition to any diet. They are low in calories and carbohydrates but pack a punch when it comes to vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants. Whether you enjoy them fresh, roasted, or in salads, cherry tomatoes are a versatile and healthy choice for any meal or snack.\nYou may want to see also\nAre cherry tomatoes considered a low-carb food?\nCherry tomatoes are small, round tomatoes that are both delicious and nutritious. They are commonly used in salads, salsas, and as a garnish for various dishes. One common question that arises when it comes to cherry tomatoes is whether they are considered a low-carb food. In this article, we will delve into this topic and provide you with the information you need.\nTo determine if cherry tomatoes are low-carb, we must first understand the concept of low-carb diets. Low-carb diets are based on the principle of reducing carbohydrate intake and replacing it with fats and proteins. The goal of these diets is to promote weight loss, improve blood sugar control, and enhance overall health.\nCarbohydrates are the main source of energy for the body, and they are found in various foods such as grains, fruits, vegetables, and dairy products. However, not all carbohydrates are created equal. Some carbohydrates, such as those found in fruits and vegetables, are considered complex carbohydrates and are generally healthier than simple carbohydrates found in processed foods and sugary snacks.\nCherry tomatoes fall into the category of vegetables and are therefore considered a complex carbohydrate. They are relatively low in calories and carbohydrates compared to other types of tomatoes. According to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), one cup of cherry tomatoes contains approximately 27 calories and 6 grams of carbohydrates.\nThe low carbohydrate content of cherry tomatoes makes them suitable for individuals following low-carb diets. They can be included in salads, omelets, or enjoyed as a snack without significantly impacting blood sugar levels or derailing a low-carb eating plan.\nIn addition to being low in carbs, cherry tomatoes are also packed with various vitamins and minerals. They are an excellent source of vitamin C, potassium, and folate. These nutrients contribute to the overall health and well-being of individuals, making cherry tomatoes a great addition to a healthy diet.\nTo incorporate cherry tomatoes into your low-carb diet, you can enjoy them in various ways. They can be sliced and added to salads, roasted with olive oil and herbs, or used as a topping for grilled meats or fish. Their sweet and tangy flavor can add a burst of freshness to any dish.\nIn conclusion, cherry tomatoes can be considered a low-carb food due to their relatively low calorie and carbohydrate content. They are a nutritious addition to any diet, providing essential vitamins and minerals. Whether you are following a low-carb eating plan or simply looking to incorporate more vegetables into your meals, cherry tomatoes are a versatile and delicious choice.\nYou may want to see also\nCan you incorporate cherry tomatoes into a low-carb diet?\nCherry tomatoes are a popular ingredient in many dishes, and if you are following a low-carb diet, you may be wondering if they can be incorporated into your meal plan. Fortunately, cherry tomatoes are a great addition to a low-carb diet and can provide numerous health benefits.\nCherry tomatoes are low in carbohydrates and calories, making them an excellent choice for those looking to reduce their carbohydrate intake. In fact, one cup of cherry tomatoes contains only around 6 grams of carbohydrates, making them a suitable choice for those following a low-carb diet.\nIn addition to being low in carbohydrates, cherry tomatoes are also packed with essential nutrients. They are an excellent source of vitamin C, potassium, and fiber. Vitamin C is important for supporting a healthy immune system, while potassium is important for maintaining proper heart and muscle function. The fiber content in cherry tomatoes can aid in digestion and help keep you feeling full and satisfied.\nIncluding cherry tomatoes in your low-carb diet is easy and versatile. They can be used in a variety of dishes, including salads, sauces, and even as a snack on their own. For example, you can toss cherry tomatoes into a salad with mixed greens, cucumber, and avocado for a low-carb and nutrient-dense meal. You can also roast cherry tomatoes and use them as a topping for grilled chicken or fish.\nIt is worth noting that while cherry tomatoes are low in carbohydrates, their carbohydrate content can vary slightly depending on their size and ripeness. To ensure a more accurate carbohydrate count, it is recommended to weigh or measure the cherry tomatoes before incorporating them into your meal plan.\nIn conclusion, cherry tomatoes are a great addition to a low-carb diet. They are low in carbohydrates, while also providing essential nutrients such as vitamin C, potassium, and fiber. Including cherry tomatoes in your meals and snacks can add flavor and variety to your low-carb diet, while also providing numerous health benefits. So go ahead and enjoy those cherry tomatoes guilt-free!\nYou may want to see also\nAre there any carbs in cherry tomatoes that should be avoided on a low-carb diet?\nCherry tomatoes are a popular choice for low-carb dieters due to their small size, vibrant flavor, and versatility. These bite-sized tomatoes can be enjoyed in salads, sauces, or simply as a healthy snack. But are there any carbs in cherry tomatoes that should be avoided on a low-carb diet? Let's take a closer look.\nCarbohydrates are one of the three macronutrients found in food, along with protein and fat. They are an essential source of energy for the body, but not all carbohydrates are created equal. Some carbohydrates, like those found in processed foods and sugary treats, can lead to weight gain and affect blood sugar levels.\nHowever, not all carbohydrates are bad for you. In fact, fruits and vegetables, including cherry tomatoes, are nutrient-dense foods that provide essential vitamins, minerals, and fiber. The carbohydrates found in these foods are typically considered complex carbohydrates, which take longer to digest and have a lower impact on blood sugar levels.\nSo, how many carbs are in cherry tomatoes? On average, one cup of cherry tomatoes contains about 6 grams of carbohydrates. This may vary slightly depending on the size and ripeness of the tomatoes. However, keep in mind that these carbs come from natural sugars and fiber, which are beneficial for overall health.\nOn a low-carb diet, it is generally recommended to limit daily carbohydrate intake to around 20-50 grams, depending on individual needs and goals. Including a serving of cherry tomatoes in your meal plan can easily fit within this range. In fact, cherry tomatoes can be a great source of essential nutrients while still keeping your carbohydrate intake low.\nAdditionally, cherry tomatoes are rich in antioxidants, such as lycopene, which has been linked to various health benefits. Lycopene is a powerful antioxidant that helps protect against harmful free radicals and may reduce the risk of certain chronic diseases, including heart disease and certain types of cancer.\nWhen incorporating cherry tomatoes into your low-carb diet, it's important to consider the other components of your meal. For example, if you're enjoying a salad with cherry tomatoes, make sure to choose low-carb toppings and dressings to keep your overall carbohydrate intake in check. Pairing cherry tomatoes with protein and healthy fats, such as avocado or olive oil, can also help balance out your meal and provide a satisfying, nutrient-rich option.\nIn conclusion, cherry tomatoes are a delicious and nutritious addition to a low-carb diet. While they do contain carbohydrates, these are natural sugars and fiber that can be beneficial for overall health. By controlling portion sizes and balancing your meal with other low-carb options, you can enjoy the vibrant flavor of cherry tomatoes without sabotaging your low-carb goals.\nYou may want to see also\nWhat other low-carb options can be paired with cherry tomatoes in a meal?\nCherry tomatoes are a versatile ingredient that can be paired with a variety of low-carb options to create a delicious and satisfying meal. Whether you are following a low-carb diet or simply looking to incorporate more veggies into your meals, cherry tomatoes are a great choice.\nOne popular option is to pair cherry tomatoes with fresh mozzarella and basil to create a Caprese salad. This classic combination is not only low in carbs, but also packed with flavor. To make the salad, simply slice the cherry tomatoes in half and combine them with slices of fresh mozzarella and whole basil leaves. Drizzle with olive oil and balsamic vinegar for added flavor.\nAnother option is to use cherry tomatoes as a topping for grilled chicken or fish. Simply toss the cherry tomatoes in olive oil, salt, and pepper, then grill them until they are slightly charred. This adds a burst of fresh flavor to your protein without adding any extra carbs.\nIf you're looking for a heartier option, consider pairing cherry tomatoes with zucchini noodles.

The participants had their vitamin D levels checked within 100 days of their surgery or 100 days after the operation.\nNormal vitamin D levels were found in 21 patients, but 81 transplant recipients were deficient. The rejection rate in the deficient group was more than twice as high as the group with adequate levels of vitamin D. The deficient group also had more than twice as many infections, and their mortality rate was nearly five times higher one year post-transplant.\nThe study authors said 52 percent of the transplant patients received a vitamin D supplement before their surgery. One year later, 75 patients had normal levels of the nutrient and 27 did not.\n\"Given the high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in lung transplant patients and the growing evidence that this supplement helps the immune system tolerate the organ, optimal levels of vitamin D are critical for positive outcomes in these patients,\" Lowery said.\nThe study was published recently in the Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation.\nThe body uses sunlight to make vitamin D.

As the zygotes transition through the cell cycle, these [Ca 2+]i oscillations progressively diminish until they cease in interphase zygotes. While the mechanism(s) underlying the regulation of [Ca2+]i oscillations may be multi-layered, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (IP3Rs) emerge as a focal point in this regulation. IP3Rs, the calcium channels expressed in all cell types and abundantly expressed in mammalian eggs, contain consensus sequences for phosphorylation by various kinases and interact with members of the cytoskeleton, serving as an integrator of regulatory signals. This dissertation highlights the impact of biochemical and cellular changes in IP3R-1 on fertilization-induced [Ca2+]i oscillations.

{"text":"Please welcome Rhoda as she kindly stops here on her Historical Fiction Virtual Book Tour to discuss her new book. She has brought us a terrific guest post!!!\nThe difficulties suffered by women of past generations who worked in factories to provide for their families is almost unimaginable to us today. Factory work took a toll on women physically, emotionally, and financially. In addition, factory work damaged the relationships with their partners and children.\nPhysically, most factory workers of the past had to endure tiresomely long days. Standing on their feet, in the extreme cold and heat without modern temperature controls must have been unbearable. For most of American history, the factory workers received only Sundays off. At the time, Sunday was considered a day of rest due to stricter applications of biblical preachings. Overnight shifts and holidays were required, and factories often produced a lot of smog and pollution. Not only were the workers covered with soot, but they were inhaling it. They would blow their noses and the soot would be be expelled from the nose onto the handkerchief. Many factories required huge fires or boilers of some sort to produce the energy to power the equipment that was being used. Thus, adding to the extreme temperatures.\nAs second class citizens of decades past, women were often thought of as expendable. They were intimidated by threats that a man could replace them. Many women lost their jobs during pregnancy because the employer did not want to be concerned with physical limitations of the pregnant women. Nor did the employers want to lose an employee during the delivery and recovery period. Unlike seamstress or house servant jobs, factories put women side by side with male co-workers. Many women were sexually harassed or assaulted because the employers and male co-workers realized there was no place for the female worker to go. A woman who had a family could not just quit, file a lawsuit, or collect unemployment. She had to endure the disrespect and violation that her employers or co-workers wished to inflict upon her. It was a trap--a trap that was created by the society of men in power. The laws of the time stated that a woman could not be raped, claiming it was physically impossible. In her 2007 book, Rape: A History from 1860 to the present, author Joanna Bourke quoted directly from medical textbooks of the past that rape was impossible. The medical and legal profession claimed \"it is impossible to sheath a sword into a vibrating scabbard.\" Immigrant women suffered even worse. Signs were often displayed \u201cNo Irish Need Apply\u201d, causing more stress for women. This was the reality women faced, not just in the factories, but in all aspects of their lives.\nSome factories who employed women paid them much less than male counterparts. In addition, if the woman was an immigrant she was often paid even less. The only way for such women to be able to work and ensure care for their children would be to live with family. Often there would be groups of people living in one household that functioned as one unit. The large amount of people were often cramped into close quarters because wages were too low to pay for larger homes. It is nearly unfathomable for Americans today to repair shoes, or stuff items in their shoes to prolong wear. Darning socks is a thing of the past. These were amongst the things that were required of low paying factory workers in order to financially survive.\nIn 1975, author Henry \"Hank\" Leiferman wrote of the struggles of one mill worker in his book Crystal Lee: A Woman of Inheritance. Crystal Lee Pulley fought for better working conditions and unionization of her mill. She was fired from the mill, yet gained a position with the union to improve conditions elsewhere. However, since 1976 the American textile industry has lost 2.6 million jobs. Although conditions improved, the jobs eventually disappeared. This left women unemployed and competing with others who were better educated.\nFactory and\/or warehouse life today still causes great hardships for women and their families. Many women are forced to work overnight shifts, weekends, and holidays. Having to work a shift such as 2:30pm to 11:00 pm causes a disconnect in the family because the mother only sees her children an hour or so before sending them off to school in the morning. By the time they return from school, she is already at work. The burdens of childcare costs are staggering. Often the woman is a single mother who lives paycheck to paycheck. Even unionized warehouse or factory establishments which have better conditions overall cause much stress amongst the families.\nAlthough working conditions and the social status of women have improved over the last century, women are still facing obstacles in the workplace. Perhaps looking to their sisters of the past, women of the present can gain the strength to face their own struggles today.\nCreateSpace Independent Publishing\nFormats: eBook, Paperback, Audio Book\nGenre: Historical Fiction\nREAD AN EXCERPT.\nBuy the Book\nAmazon (Audio Book)\nNational Military Family Association\n$1 per sale will be donated, regardless of what format is purchased---ebook, print, audiobook & regardless of site purchased---will be donated to the National Military Family Association.

She began working at the United States Postal Service at 25 years old, and over the past 15 years has accumulated many humorous stories about situations that the public never gets to know about. Her first ebook, \"Goin' Postal: True Stories of a U.S. Postal Worker\" was so popular that readers requested it in paperback. Recently, she published the humorous \"Goin' Postal\" in paperback along with another story entitled, \"The Creek: Where Stories of the Past Come Alive\".

{"text":"Sacramento Public Library hit the road earlier this summer with electric bookmobiles. The library on wheels visits local events and communities with limited access to libraries. Last year, bookmobiles logged over 10,000 miles visiting communities throughout Sacramento County.\nThe two new bookmobiles replaced the 25-year old diesel vehicles thanks to a partnership with the Sacramento Metropolitan Air Quality Management District and California State Library.\n\u201cWe were long overdue for a change. The average bookmobile\u2019s lifespan is 10-15 years,\u201d said Cathy Crosthwaite, Sacramento Public Library Deputy Director. \u201cThis is one small way we can make an impact in our daily operations. Plus, the new EVs are so much quieter and provide a better experience for our patrons.\u201d\nThe library\u2019s Mobile Services team visits senior sites, residential communities, mobile home parks, and assisted living facilities. Our bookmobiles have served the community since 1948 and operate as mini libraries. Staff customize the collection based on the community\u2019s preferences with materials in various languages, genres and formats. Library users can place items on hold over the phone or online to be checked out from the vehicle.\n\u201cIt\u2019s vital that we meet the community where they are and get outside of the library walls. Bookmobiles help us make those connections,\u201d said Todd Deck, Sacramento Public Library Community Engagement Manager. \u201cOur team does their best to reach folks that can\u2019t otherwise get to a library. Bookmobiles also provide social interactions and help foster community between residents and the staff who deliver library services to them.\u201d\nWhen the pandemic hit in March 2020, the library temporarily closed for a few months. The Mobile Services team was the first to resume library services and get back into the community. For many patrons, especially seniors, the bookmobile is one of the few social outlets they have in a month.\nIn 2022, Sacramento Public Library bookmobiles made nearly 800 visits circulating 35,800 materials including books, DVDs, hotspots and more. The library has two regular bookmobile routes. The family route, which focuses on children and families in apartment complexes and other affordable housing communities, visits 10 locations. The senior route visits more than 40 retirement communities, assisted living centers, and mobile home parks on a monthly schedule.\nThis program is funded in part by:","metadata":{"date":1709312014000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947475422.71\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240301161412-20240301191412-00398.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9388421774,"token_count":488,"url":"https:\/\/www.saclibrary.org\/About\/News\/2023\/evbookmobile"},"score":2,"id":"16"}
{"text":"You know those block graphic symbols that allows you to draw lines, corners, intersections, fine bar charts, etc. they are useful and one can do a lot of stuff, but their code arrangements always struck me as arbitrary \/ random. But then maybe I just haven't figured out the logic. Does anybody know why they ended up with the codes they got?\nThe \"PETSCII\" encoding is based on keyboard positions of the original PET chicklet keyboard (*1):\n(Taken from Wikipedia)\nThe keyboard is made similar to basic typewriter keyboards, but ordered in a square fashion, including a top row of symbols but not numbers and a separate numeric keyboard. By every key holding only a single ASCII equivalent symbol (*2), it leads to a direct encoding of ASCII as key position.\nAs a side effect the whole shift level could be used for graphics, as they did. All symols are ordered in a (mostly) useful pattern, like having\nUIJK forming the 4 sections of a circle,\nOPL: doing the same for the corners of a large square and\n0.-=the same for a small square.\nIt not only looks neat on the keyboard but also makes a good UI as far as ordering of symbols can get.\nThe downside is that graphic symbols are encoded according to the (unsifted) character code. And here combinations like\nUIJK are simply non-continuous. As listing the PETSCII assignment shows:\n(Taken from Wikipedia)\nFrom a programmers perspective this is less than perfect. A logical sequence for related items (*3) could have been more helpful. This is especially true for the 16 codes that form a 2x2 division of a character cell would allow an easy 'bitmap' mode for 80x48 pixel (*4). Much like contemporary TRS-80 and Sinclair's ZX80\/81 some years later.\nAn additionally sad part is that PETSCII itself isn't direct used for display, but translated into screencodes beforehand. If not right ahead, this would have been a good point to reorder.\n... and so it became history :)\n*1 - The Wikipedia entry for 'Chicklet Keyboard' is a nice example for a retrograde explanation.\n*2 - Almost as if the first version was not meant to use shift.\n*3 - Much like ASCII offers a monotone sequence for numbers ($30..$39) and letters ($41..$5A). The later according to the usual lexical sequence, as made popular by Bartholomeus Anglicus.\n*4 - As usual they have been used anyway, but with a translation layer. Some of them, written in BASIC, look more like on purpose obfuscation.\nI think the codes were laid out so that when laid out sensibly on the PET keyboard, the shifted and unshifted forms of each key would have a consistent relationship. When the VIC-20 reduced the number of keys but added the Commodore key, this made it necessary to rearrange the placement of graphics on the keys; since Commodore kept the same arrangement of character codes, however, this meant that the arrangement no longer seemed to make as much sense.\nOne can see a similar effect in the design of ASCII. Many typewriters used to use a shifted 2 for a quotation mark, early teletypes did likewise, and thus the ASCII code for the quote mark is one bit different from that of the digit 2, even though modern keyboards use a shifted apostrophe as the quote mark.","metadata":{"date":1709108341000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947474700.89\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240228080245-20240228110245-00699.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9505418539,"token_count":726,"url":"https:\/\/retrocomputing.stackexchange.com\/questions\/15706\/c64-petscii-block-graphic-symbol-was-there-ever-a-logical-reason-for-their-asc\/15709"},"score":4,"id":"17"}

{"text":"A lamb is a young sheep that is still weak and defenseless when unprotected and alone. Because of this, lambs are targeted by predators because they present easy prey to them. When lambs are left on their own, they either get hunted down or stuck and lost, so they need guidance.\nThese are the qualities that make lambs so symbolic. They are a sign of innocence, purity, vulnerability, and sacrifice. Many of these symbols overlap with the symbolism of youth.\nLambs have been sacrificial animals throughout the entire human history \u2013 even the Ancient Greeks and Romans used lambs as sacrificial animals. Later, lambs became symbolic of Jesus Christ\u2019s sacrifice for his followers.\nIn this article, we\u2019ll discuss the symbolism of lambs in Christianity, literature, and life. You\u2019ll find some interesting meanings that you perhaps didn\u2019t know about before.\nThe 8 Symbolisms of Lamb in Life\nAs such, lambs are innocent animals that are still naive and new to life. They don\u2019t have the experience or the ability to protect themselves, so they stick to groups instead of wandering away on their own. They\u2019re also oblivious to the dangers around them.\nBecause of that, lambs represent innocence \u2013 sometimes, even human innocence. They are not aware of what is out there and what the world looks like \u2013 they need to be guided and protected by the group.\nLambs are small and weak, and they do not become sheep until the age of 1. They can\u2019t protect themselves alone, so they need to stay in groups or be protected by their parents. If they stray away from the group, the likelihood of their survival is close to zero.\nIt is this vulnerability of lambs that made them so symbolic, even in Christianity. They\u2019ve become the symbol of God because they represent the weakest, vulnerable part of God, the part which is always willing to give to humans.\nNot only lambs, but sheep can be a representative of an individual\u2019s vulnerability. As spirit animals, sheep (and lamb) denote that someone is vulnerable in their character. It\u2019s symbolic of someone who needs support from others in times of need when things get tough, just like lambs do when they are in danger.\nRead Article: Black Sheep Spiritual Meaning and Symbolism\nAs lambs are fresh and new to the world, they are free from sin. This is one of the most revered qualities of Christianity and a huge reason why lambs are so symbolic in Christianity, too.\nThe wolf is impure, while the lamb is pure and weak. The wolf is the hunter, greedy, and looking for food, which can represent the dark side of our character. On the other hand, we have lambs that are pure and vulnerable, and sometimes even weak. In a way, it\u2019s a collision of two different parts of our character.\nLambs have always been sacrificial animals. From the Ancient Greeks and Romans to Christians and even later civilizations, lambs were used for sacrifice to a higher purpose. In most cases, it was the sacrifice to Gods.\nAccording to Merriam-Webster, the term sacrificial lamb represents something or someone that\u2019s sacrificed for the greater good.\nEven today, lambs are used for sacrifice in Passover sacrifice, which was an important part of the Israelite faith. Today, it\u2019s only practiced by Samaritans at Mount Gerizim. In most cases, the sacrifice of lambs represents something that\u2019s beneficial for the greater good of the community.\nIn the Abrahamic religion, a lamb was and is a very highly valued possession. This term of the sacrifice of the lambs is widely present in everyday life, too. A good example of this is in politics, where a sacrificial lamb is a candidate in elections who has little or no chance of winning an election but is still representing the party for the greater good.\nWe\u2019ll touch on the meaning of the sacrifice of lambs in Christianity later on, because there are many references to it in the Bible, too.\nLambs are also highly symbolic of family. They are often depicted in Ancient paintings and works of art together with a sheep and a ram, which is obviously a symbol for the family. The lamb is the child, the sheep is the mother, and the ram is the father.\nWhen we think about it, lambs can also represent children in a way. They are both young, naive, and new to the world, and also not aware of the real world around them. They are oblivious to the bad things happening in the world, and also somewhat unable to survive with the help of their parents. They represent the same qualities, such as innocence and purity.\n7. Herd Behavior\nHerd behavior is obviously typical for animals \u2013 they form herds without a centralized leader for the purpose of staying safe and without directions. Lambs can represent that to an extent. It also represents a degree of naivety and a lack of introspection where individuals follow vague beliefs and directions from someone else. Without a \u201cshepherd\u201d, they are lost.\nSometimes, this term is coined in financial settings where investors follow other investors blindly based on prior results or false beliefs.\nThis symbolism is similar to the symbolism of childhood. Lambs don\u2019t know how to decide for themselves, so they follow others. And when they do that, they might not follow the best examples \u2013 they only follow the ones they find the strongest and most convincing.\nThis naivety can lead them astray in their later years. Just like teenagers get lost, lambs and sheep can get lost themselves and might find themselves in danger. They can either get stuck somewhere or be hunted by predators.\nThe Symbolism of Lambs in Christianity\nLambs are one of the central symbols of Christianity. They represent sacrifice and purity, two of the most important pillars of the Christian faith. As such, they are highly symbolic of God himself, who is pure and sacrifices himself for his followers.\nLamb also signifies innocence in Christianity. It\u2019s symbolic of everything that\u2019s innocent, including Jesus Christ himself. This is visible in several passages of the Bible, including this passage from Isaiah:\n\u201cThe wolf shall dwell within the lamb, and the leopard shall lie down with the kid; and the calf and the young lion and the fatling together, and a little child shall lead them.\u201d\nIn this passage, the lamb is described as this conforming and innocent animal that\u2019s seeking guidance. In this passage, the wolf denotes anyone that\u2019s against innocent and the lamb represents innocence, which is the opposite of the wolf.\nIn Christianity, lambs are also sacrificial animals, which is often denoted in the Bible itself, too. They also represent Jesus Christ\u2019s sacrifice for his followers and the sacrifices we make for the greater good.\nThis is visible in the Book of Genesis where Abraham sacrifices the lamb which is provided by God, which is the perfect sacrificial offering.\nHowever, perhaps the most notable symbolism of the lamb in Christianity is that of the true Lamb of God. The lamb of God is also synonymous with Jesus himself, who is seen as the sacrifice for the rest of his followers and for the rest of humanity. This is portrayed by John the Baptist in his passage (1:29):\n\u201cBehold, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin from the world!\u201d\nJesus becomes the Lamb of God, and he is defenseless and is led to death freely. He frees his followers from sin and death. This symbolism has become legendary in Christianity and perhaps the most notable mention of the lamb in the Bible. As such, the main meaning of the lamb in the Bible is that of sacrifice.\nThe Symbolism of Lambs in Literature\nBecause lambs are so symbolic, they are often present in literature, too.\nOne of the most notable examples is the poem by William Blake called The Lamb. In this poem, the lamb is the subject and the main \u201cprotagonist\u201d. It represents the perfect creation by God, and it gives wool to humans, which is a gift from God himself. Also, Blake describes the voice of the lamb as \u201ctender\u201d.\nThe entire setting of the poem seems somewhat idyllic and pastoral. Perhaps the lamb is symbolic also of beauty and perfection, and also of the nature that is so beautiful (which is described in the poem).\nBy the end of the poem, the term lamb is synonymous with God who created the lamb. God is represented by a small child and the lamb is his creation.\nLambs are historically and symbolically very notable animals. They\u2019ve been used as sacrificial animals centuries ago, even by Ancient Greeks and Romans. They represent innocence, purity, and sacrifice. They are also symbolic of naivety, childhood, family, and also belonging.\nBecause of their traits and features, lambs are highly symbolic also in Christianity and literature, as well as in other faiths (Israelites and Abrahamism). It\u2019s interesting to explore the symbolism of lamb and the different meanings of lamb \u2013 some are even unexpected!\nI\u2019m Chris and I run this website \u2013 a resource about symbolism, metaphors, idioms, and a whole lot more!

{"text":"Shunt Clipping Circuits:\nA positive Shunt Clipping Circuits is illustrated in Fig. 3-28(a). Here the diode is connected in shunt (or parallel) with the output terminals. When the input is negative, the diode is reverse biased and only a small voltage drop occurs across RI, due to load current IL. This means that the circuit output voltage (Vo) is approximately equal to the negative input peak (-E). When the input is +E, D1 is forward biased, and the output voltage equals the diode voltage drop (+VF). Thus, the positive half of the waveform is clipped off. As illustrated, the upper and lower levels of the output of a positive shunt clipper are approximately +VF and -E.\nA negative Shunt Clipping Circuits is exactly the same as a positive shunt clipper with the diode polarity reversed, [see Fig. 3-28(b)]. The negative half-cycle of the waveform is clipped off.\nAs in the case of series clipping circuits, Shunt Clipping Circuits may be used with square, sinusoidal, or other input waveforms.\nShunt Noise Clipper:\nThe shunt noise clipper shown in Fig. 3-30 removes noise riding on the peaks of an input waveform. The signal amplitude must be greater than the diode forward voltage drop. The output waveform is clipped, at \u00b1VF , so that the noise is not passed to the output. This type of clipper is used with pulse signals, where the pulse amplitude is not important. In this case, information is contained in the pulse width, or simply in its presence or absence.\nBiased Shunt Clipper:\nFigure 3-31 shows a clipping circuit that uses two diodes which have different bias voltages. The cathode of D1 is connected to a +2 V bias (VB1), and the anode of D2 has a -2 V bias (VB2). While the input waveform amplitude is less than \u00b1(VB + VF), neither diode is forward biased, and the input is simply passed to the output. When the positive input is greater than (VB1 + VF). D1 becomes forward biased, and the output cannot exceed this voltage. Similarly, when the negative input goes below (-VB2 \u2013 VF). D2 is forward biased, and the output is limited to -(VB2 + VF).\nFor obvious reasons, the circuit is termed a biased Shunt Clipping Circuits. Biased shunt clippers are used to protect circuits or devices from (positive\/negative) input voltages that must not exceed specified levels.\nThe voltage across resistor R1 is (E \u2013 Vo), and the resistor current is the sum of the load current and the diode forward current (IL + IF). As in other diode circuits, a minimum level of IF is selected, and the resistor value is calculated as,\nZener Diode Shunt Clipper:\nA Zener diode shunt clipper produces the same kind of result as a biased shunt clipper without the need for bias voltages.

{"text":"If the familiar, colorful spinning reels and bright lights are spinning and the music is blaring Why do people go to casinos? Although I think casino slots are a legitimate form of gambling, they\u2019re not as thrilling as real mone trustly withdrawal casinoy gambling. While you can get pretty comfortable with slots by playing them in the presence of a lamp or sipping your favorite drink but ultimately, it\u2019s the ability that will win. Here are some information about slots.\nThere are two fundamental sets of spins no matter the casino where you play at home: one for the console, one for the computer and the other for consoles. The ball spins for one time when you place your wager. Then it stops. The staff at the casino will inform you when the ball needs to stop and begin with the next spin. The direction that the ball spins depends on the symbols that are visible on the reels. The symbol the ball is spinning on determines the direction it will take. If the symbol for up is used to indicate that the ball is moving upwards, that is the direction in which the ball will travel.\nAt online casinos you will see a random number generator (RNG). It is a set of computer software that generates numbers that determine the symbols that will be displayed on the reels. When a player plays at casinos online, they utilize one of these random numbers generators. This software ensures pay by mobile casino free spins that the bets placed upon random chance.\nRandom number generators determine the outcome of every spin on the casino slot machine. At online casinos , the outcome of each spin is decided by a program which is downloaded on your PC. A random number generator is installed on your PC, and you can begin spinning a slot machine whenever you wish. Many people believe that because they know the outcome of the random number generator, they are somehow cheating. You could increase your chances of win by cheating the machine.\nYou have a higher chance of winning than the house edge of the casino. The house advantage refers to the percentage of slot machine profits that casino owners make. Casinos have a higher percentage of slots playing, which means they are more likely to be successful. Casino owners earn more from their progressive slots due to the fact that they own more of them.\nCasinos online are designed to allow players to play for as long as they like. You can quit playing in the event that you become bored. Many players prefer to benefit from bonuses that do not require deposit that some casinos online offer. Online slot players who wager big winnings have a better chance of double their initial bet.\nPlaying for free or progressive slots can allow you to make real money. There are no limitations on how much money you can earn. You will need an Internet connection to play for free online slot machines at casinos.\nEach machine spins an entirely different set of coins. Random elements will determine the combinations that the machines generate. While the casino will attempt to create as random a spin as is possible by using only the most likely options, no machine is perfect. Multi-bets are the most effective method to increase your chances of winning the jackpot. You can increase your winnings by knowing what the odds of a slot machine are for every spin on a particular machine.","metadata":{"date":1709196344000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947474795.48\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240229071243-20240229101243-00398.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9442362785,"token_count":666,"url":"https:\/\/shamanlodgeresortecuador.com\/find-out-which-slots-are-paying-more\/"},"score":2,"id":"21"}
{"text":"\"Kapila said, 'The Vedas are regarded as authoritative by all. People never\ndisregard them. Brahma is of two kinds, viz., Brahma as represented by sound, and Brahma as Supreme (and intangible). 1 One conversant with Brahma represented by sound succeeds in attaining to Supreme Brahma. Commencing with the rites of Garbhadhana, that body which the sire creates with the aid of Vedic mantras is cleansed (after birth) by Vedic mantras. 2 When the body has been cleansed with purificatory rites (performed with the aid of Vedic mantras), the owner there of come to be called a Brahmana and becomes a vessel fit for receiving knowledge of Brahma. Know that the reward of acts is purity of heart which only leads to Emancipation. I shall presently speak to thee of that. Whether purity of heart has been attained or not (by performance of acts) is what can be known to the person himself who has attained it. It can never be known with the aid of either the Vedas or inference. They that cherish no expectation, that discard every kind of wealth by not storing anything for future use, that are not covetous, and that are free from every kind of affection and aversion, perform sacrifices because of the conviction that their performance is a duty. To make gifts unto deserving persons is the end (right use) of all wealth. Never addicted at any time to sinful acts, observant of those rites that have been laid down in the Vedas, capable of crowning all their wishes with fruition, endued with certain conclusions through pure knowledge, never giving way to wrath,--never indulging in envy, free from pride and malice, firm in Yoga, 3 of unstained birth, unstained conduct, and unstained learning, devoted to the good of all creatures, there were in days of yore many men, leading lives of domesticity and thoroughly devoted to their own duties, there were many kings also of the same qualifications, devoted to Yoga (like Janaka, etc.), and many Brahmanas also of the same character (like Yajnavalkya and others). 4 They behaved equally towards all creatures and were endued with perfect sincerity. Contentment was theirs, and certainty of knowledge. Visible were the rewards of their righteousness, and pure were they in behaviour and heart. They were possessed of faith in Brahma of both forms. 5 At first making their hearts pure, they duly observed all (excellent) vows. They were observant of the duties of righteousness on even occasions of distress and difficulty, without failing off in any particular. Uniting together they used to perform meritorious acts. In this they found great happiness. And inasmuch as they never tripped, they had never to perform any expiation. Relying as they did\nupon the true course of righteousness, they became endued with irresistible energy. They never followed their own understandings in the matter of earning merit but followed the dictates of the scriptures alone for that end. Accordingly they were never guilty of guile in the matter of performing acts of righteousness. 1 In consequence of their observing unitedly the absolute ordinances of the scriptures without betaking themselves ever to the rites laid down in the alternative, they were never under the necessity of performing expiation. 2 There is no expiation for men living in the observance of the ordinances laid down in the scriptures. The Sruti declares that expiation exists for only men that are weak and unable to follow the absolute and substantive provisions of the sacred law. Many Brahmanas there were of this kind in days of old, devoted to the performance of sacrifices, of profound knowledge of the Vedas, possessed of purity and good conduct, and endued with fame. They always worshipped Brahma in the sacrifices, and were free from desire. Possessed of learning they transcended all the bonds of life. The sacrifices of these men, their (knowledge of the) Vedas, their acts performed in obedience to the ordinances, their study of the scripture at the fixed hours, and the wishes they entertained, freed as they were from lust and wrath, observant as they were of pious conduct and acts notwithstanding all difficulties, renowned as they were for performing the duties of their own order and mode of life, purified as their souls were in consequence of their very nature, characterised as they were by thorough sincerity, devoted as they were to tranquillity, and mindful as they were of their own practices, were identical with Infinite Brahma. Even this is the eternal Sruti heard by us. 3 The penances of men that were so high-souled, of men whose conduct and acts were so difficult of observance and accomplishment, of men whose wishes were crowned with fruition in consequence of the strict discharge of their duties, became efficacious weapons for the destruction of all earthly desires. The Brahmanas say that that Good Conduct, which is wonderful, whose origin may be traced to very ancient times, which is eternal and whose characteristics are unchangeable, which differs from the practices to which even the good resort in seasons of distress and represents their acts in other situations, which is identical with heedfulness, over which lust and wrath and other evil passions can never prevail, and in consequence of which there was (at one time) no transgression in all mankind, subsequently came to be distributed into four subdivisions, corresponding with the four modes of life by persons unable to\npractise its duties in minute detail and entirety. 1 They that are good, by duly observing that course of Good Conduct after adoption of the Sannyasa mode of life, attain to the highest end. They also that betake themselves to the forest mode reach the same high end (by duly observing that conduct). They too that observe the domestic mode of life attain to the highest end (by duly practising the same conduct); and, lastly, those that lead the Brahmacharya mode obtain the same (end by a due observance of the same conduct). 2 Those Brahmanas are seen to shine in the firmament as luminaries shedding beneficent rays of light all around. Those myriads of Brahmanas have become stars and constellations set in their fixed tracks. In consequence of contentment (or Renunciation) they have all attained to Infinity as the Vedas declare. If such men have to come back to the world through the wombs of living creatures, they are never stained by sins which have the unexhausted residue of previous acts for their originating cause. Indeed, one who has led the life of a Brahmacharin and waited dutifully upon his preceptor, who has arrived at settled conclusions (in respect of the soul), and who has devoted himself to Yoga thus, is truly a Brahmana. Who else would deserve to be called a Brahmana? When acts alone determine who is a Brahmana and who is not, acts (good or bad) must be held to indicate the happiness or misery of a person. As regards those that have by conquering all evil passions acquired purity of heart, we have heard the eternal Sruti that in consequence of the Infinity to which they attain (through beholding the universal soul) and of the knowledge of Brahma (they acquire through the declarations of Srutis), they behold everything to be Brahma. The duties (of tranquillity, self-restraint, abstention from acts, renunciation, devotion, and the abstraction of Samadhi) followed by those men of pure hearts, that are freed from desire, and that have Emancipation only for their object, for acquisition of the knowledge of Brahma, are equally laid down for all the four orders of men and all the four modes of life. Verily, that knowledge is always acquired by Brahmanas of pure hearts and restrained soul. 3 One whose soul is for Renunciation\nbased upon contentment is regarded as the refuge of true knowledge. Renunciation, in which is that knowledge which leads to Emancipation, and which is highly necessary for a Brahmana, is eternal (and comes down from preceptor to pupil for ever and ever). 1 Renunciation sometimes exists mixed with the duties of other modes. But whether existing in that state or by itself, one practises it according to the measure of one's strength (that depends upon the degree of one's absence of worldly desires). Renunciation is the cause of supreme benefit unto every kind of person. Only he that is weak, fails to practise it. That pure-hearted man who seeks to attain to Brahma becomes rescued from the world (with its misery).' 2\n\"Syumarasmi said, 'Amongst those that are given up to enjoyment (of property), they that make gifts, they that perform sacrifices, they that devote themselves to the study of the Vedas, and they that betake themselves to a life of Renunciation after having acquired and enjoyed wealth and all its pleasures, when they depart from this world, who is it that attains to the foremost place in heaven? I ask thee this, O Brahmana! Do thou tell me truly.'\n\"Kapila said, 'Those who lead a life of domesticity are certainly auspicious and acquire excellence of every kind. They are unable, however, to enjoy the felicity that attaches to Renunciation. Even thou mayst see this.' 3\n\"Syumarasmi said, 'Ye depend upon knowledge as the means (for the attainment of Emancipation). Those who lead lives of domesticity have planted their faith in acts. It has, however, been said that the end of all modes of life is Emancipation. 4 No difference, therefore, is observable between them in respect of either their superiority or inferiority of puissance. O illustrious one, do thou tell me then how stands the matter truly.'\n\"Kapila said, 'Acts only cleanse the body. Knowledge, however, is the highest end (for which one strives). 5 When all faults of the heart are cured (by acts), and when the felicity of Brahma becomes established in knowledge,\nbenevolence, forgiveness, tranquillity, compassion, truthfulness, and candour, abstention from injury, absence of pride, modesty, renunciation, and abstention from work are attained. These constitute the path that lead to Brahma. By those one attains to what is the Highest. That the cure of all faults of the heart is the result of acts becomes intelligible to the wise man when these are attained. That, indeed, is regarded as the highest end which is obtained by Brahmanas endued with wisdom, withdrawn from all acts, possessed of purity and the certitude of knowledge. One who succeeds in acquiring a knowledge of the Vedas, of that which is taught by the Vedas (viz., Brahma as represented in acts), and the minutiae of acts, is said to be conversant with the Vedas. Any other man is only a bag of wind. 1 One who is conversant with the Vedas knows everything, for everything is established on the Vedas. Verity, the present, past, and future all exist in the Vedas. 2 This one conclusion is deducible from all the scriptures, viz., that this universe exists and does not exist. To the man of knowledge this (all that is perceived) is both sat and asat. To him, this all is both the end and the middle. 3 This truth rests upon all the Vedas, viz., that when complete Renunciation takes place one obtains what is sufficient. Then again the highest contentment follows and rests upon Emancipation, 4 which is absolute, which exists as the soul of all mortal and immortal things, which is well-known as such universal soul, which is the highest object of knowledge as being identical with all mobile and immobile things, which is full, which is perfect felicity, which is without duality, which is the foremost of all things, which is Brahma, which is Unmanifest and the cause also, whence the Unmanifest has sprung, and which is without deterioration of any kind. 5 Ability to subdue the senses, forgiveness, and abstention from work in consequence of the absence of desire,--these three are the cause of perfect felicity. With the aid of these three qualities, men having understanding for their eyes succeed in reaching that Brahma which is\nuncreate, which is the prime cause of the universe, which is unchangeable and which is beyond destruction. I bow to that Brahma, which is identical with him that knows it.'\" 1","metadata":{"date":1709008676000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947474670.19\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240227021813-20240227051813-00797.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9777814746,"token_count":2612,"url":"http:\/\/bharatadesam.com\/spiritual\/mahabharata\/mahabharata_12b097.php"},"score":2,"id":"22"}

{"text":"The Mississippi State Baseball program has been one of the best in the country for decades, and it is time for it to return to its rightful place in 2016.\nCan the Mississippi State baseball team get back to being one of the best in the country in 2016? If you believe the polls, then we should see the Bulldogs return to a place of prominence in the college baseball landscape.\nIf you\u2019re hesitant to get fully back on board, I completely understand. The team was ranked highly in the preseason, just like they are in 2016, for the 2015 season. And things got off to a great start in 2015, but once the Mississippi State baseball team lost to Arkansas Pine Bluff, things went sour quickly.\nBut the 2016 team saw almost every major contributor for the team make incredible strides during the offseason. The players who were supposed to be the leaders of the team showed they can live up to the potential almost everyone saw in them when they were first brought to campus as freshmen.\nMore from Maroon and White Nation\n- College football schedule week 4: 3 must-watch under-the-radar games\n- Meeting the Opponent: Week 4 \u2013 South Carolina Gamecocks\n- Mississippi State football vs LSU: The good, bad, and ugly\n- M&WN Staff \u2013 Week 3 SEC Picks and Best Bets\n- Mississippi State football film study: Why did MSU\u2019s defense fail vs. LSU?\nGetting back to the top of the Collegiate baseball mountain will not be easy for the Mississippi State baseball team. The Bulldogs have road trips to LSU, Florida, and Vanderbilt, all of whom are projected to be better than the Bulldogs. And the teams that are supposed to be lower in the SEC pecking order are certainly no slouches.\nThe SEC is stacked from top to bottom with talent. But the Bulldogs have plenty of talent of their own, and if John Cohen is the right man for the job, the players on the 2016 Mississippi State baseball team will start to show off that talent in front of the fans at Dudy Noble Field.\nWinning the SEC Championship is asking a bit much of this team, but there isn\u2019t any reason this year\u2019s Mississippi State baseball team can\u2019t find themselves in the mix. Everything is there for the team to make a resurgence in 2016. If the Bulldogs don\u2019t get back to being one of the elite teams in the country this season, who knows when it will ever happen. The climb back to the top starts today against Florida Atlantic.","metadata":{"date":1708540088000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947473524.88\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240221170215-20240221200215-00898.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9602484703,"token_count":523,"url":"https:\/\/maroonandwhitenation.com\/2016\/02\/19\/mississippi-state-baseball-needs-to-restore-order-in-2016\/"},"score":0,"id":"29"}

I'm Woody LaBounty.\nDavid: And I'm David Gallagher.\nWoody: And this is the podcast\u2026\nDavid: Wait, wait.\nWoody: You're not?\nDavid: I'm David Gallagher. There that's better.\nWoody: That's your podcast voice?\nDavid: That's right, Woody.\nWoody: This is the podcast for the Western Neighborhoods Project. We do this once a week. We talk about history. We say things off the top of our heads, and sometimes we make mistakes.\nWoody: Well, last week, in particular, we made a mistake. What was it, David?\nDavid: Well, we were talking about the 1906 earthquake and we talked about, briefly, I said something about martial law being declared. And it was pointed out by an astute listener and sometime contributor, Paul Rosenberg, that martial law was not declared during the aftermath of the 1906 earthquake. [00:01:00] Though General Funston did behave in ways that were iffy.\nWoody: Uh oh. Here we go.\nDavid: But that's it. That's all I'm gonna say.\nWoody: Well see, we can correct ourselves. So, if you hear us make a mistake, please, by all means, tell us. We will correct it.\nDavid: If you even hear us, tell us.\nWoody: You have this thing that people aren't hearing this, but obviously people are hearing this.\nDavid: Paul Rosenberg for one.\nWoody: That's right. But what are we gonna talk about today? That was last week. This week we have some new, interesting West Side historic topic. What is it, David?\nDavid: We're gonna talk about the Sunnyside Conservatory.\nWoody: Conservatory? Is that a place where perhaps music is played?\nDavid: It could be.\nWoody: But not in this particular case, I don't think.\nDavid: I think sometimes it is played there.\nWoody: Aha! What is the Sunnyside Conservatory? Okay, wait. I know where the Sunnyside is and we should probably talk about that first. The Sunnyside is, despite its name, a foggy part of [00:02:00] town.\nDavid: That's not right.\nWoody: It is. Trust me. It's north of, well, it's kind of on both sides of Monterey Boulevard.\nWoody: Between Glen Park and roughly City College.\nWoody: Right, that area, that's called the Sunnyside.\nDavid: Monterey Boulevard is the main artery through the Sunnyside.\nWoody: In fact, Monterey Boulevard used to be called Sunnyside Avenue.\nWoody: When it was first, when that little tract was being developed, it was named by Joost. Behrend Joost was the guy who was behind the Sunnyside.\nDavid: So, he named Sunnyside Avenue? Did he name Joost Street? Is it Street?\nWoody: Yeah, that's named after him. I don't even know if it's Sunnyside Avenue. It could be Sunnyside Street, now I think about it. But yeah, Joost.\nDavid: We're just gonna hedge our bets on every fact we have from now on.\nWoody: We don't wanna be corrected ever again. It's always sunny in the Sunnyside. Anyway, but it was an 1890s land development scheme to create the [00:03:00] Sunnyside neighborhood. And so, that is where the Sunnyside Conservatory is, I assume.\nDavid: That's right. It's right on Monterey Boulevard. You can't miss it.\nWoody: 236, I believe is the address, and I think it was built, see, I do know something about it. I'm revealing that I do know something about this. This building was built in the early 1900s, probably just after 1900. So, what\u2019s a conservatory? The other conservatory I think of is the Conservatory of Flowers in Golden Gate Park.\nWoody: And so, a conservatory is a place where you might grow plants or something.\nDavid: Right. And anyway, it's kind of a, the Sunnyside Conservatory is an octagonal building, does it have eight sides? It's kind of octagonal, it's a tall\u2026\nWoody: I think it does have eight sides.\nDavid: Window, window-lined building that lets the light in. And I believe that it was made to grow plants in, by the owners.\nWoody: Right. [00:04:00] The guy who bought it, a little research was done, and the gentleman who first bought that land bought a number of lots in the Sunnyside neighborhood together. So, he had a big plot of land and his last name was Merralls. And the conservatory seemed to have been a building that was built to probably raise hot house flowers or plants that would thrive in a sort of conservatory environment.\nDavid: Right. So, it was private.\nDavid: It was his own place in his own yard.\nWoody: That's right. And it has some interesting little stories that have been passed down through the years though. But your memory of the Sunnyside Conservatory, when you first became aware of it, was it being used as a conservatory?\nDavid: No, it was kind of a, it was a public park-ish place where you could walk in. They had one of the park, I think Park and Rec ran it.\nDavid: Except that it was very decrepit. It was open to the elements. A lot of the windows were broken. There really wasn\u2019t, there weren't [00:05:00] many people hanging around there except for people drinking beer and stuff, I think.\nWoody: Were these people your friends?\nDavid: Some of them. Some of the people drinking beer there were my friends. Some of them were just acquaintances.\nWoody: Yeah, so the time you're remembering, it's the time I remember probably in the early \u201880s, mid-\u201880s. And it was this kind of park land that was right along Monterey Boulevard with this building and all the trees and everything were overgrown and the building kind of was just sticking out of this bushy tree, technically a city park.\nWoody: Because the conservatory was actually made a city landmark, a San Francisco city landmark in 1975.\nWoody: So, it had been noted as a notable building.\nWoody: In San Francisco. And it was the landmark of the Sunnyside District for sure. It really kind of sticks out as an interesting building. And we talk about it being octagonal and, you know, people used to think that eight [00:06:00] sided buildings were somehow more healthy. There was this strange sort of belief, and for a long time, people were, there was a fad of building eight-sided houses because they thought it brought in more light and it was just better for your health. So, the conservatory, maybe the gentleman thought that an eight-sided conservatory was better for his plants. I don't know.\nWoody: Anyway, I was gonna say there's some interesting stories that have kind of, it's more legends and lore that have come down through the years about the conservatory. One story that I\u2019ve heard, which I really don't believe, but I like, was that a woman who bought the land after Merralls had died and she had just bought the land and the lots and all the plants around it. There was a house also on the lot. She didn't know the conservatory was there because it was so overgrown, the patch of land, until her dog ran into the bushes and she went to retrieve him and said, \u201cWhat the heck? There's a giant octagonal building in the middle of my plot of land.\u201d [00:07:00]\nWoody: I don't think that's true, but that is a good story.\nWoody: Yeah. I guess I was trying to say how sort of decrepit and overgrown the land was. But the first, let's talk a little bit about what was going on there. The other story I had heard was the guy who originally owned it, who I think was the original owner, was an inventor. And one of the things he was trying to invent was a balloon or an aircraft. You know, everybody was trying to build aircraft.\nDavid: A dirigible.\nWoody: Yeah. Something in the early 20th century. And that was, he was\u2026\nDavid: I don't know if a dirigible is a balloon or not, or if it's an air ship. I don't know.\nWoody: Yeah. Anyway, I don't think he was a great inventor. And he actually got run over by a train, was how he actually died unfortunately.\nDavid: One of Joost\u2019s trains running up Sunnyside Avenue?\nWoody: It might have been because Behrend Joost also brought the first electric streetcar system to San Francisco. Another sideline there.\nDavid: Right. So, I've seen pictures of [00:08:00] Sunnyside Avenue. I want to branch out a little bit onto, into the Sunnyside. And so, where was, the two main structures around that time in Sunnyside was the conservatory and Joost\u2019s powerhouse.\nWoody: Right. For the electric railway you're saying?\nWoody: Yeah. And that was all the way at the edge, like near Acadia, kind of going over towards where you can get on 280 now, getting towards the Glen Park side. Yeah, but there was a giant powerhouse for the electric railway that Behrend Joost had. That went from San Francisco all the way down to I think San Mateo. And it was a big move forward in transit technology in San Francisco, the first electric streetcar.\nDavid: Was it the precursor to the old interurban San Mateo car?\nWoody: I don't know if it ran on the same track or not. I get to talk to one of my transit historian friends about that. The first guy who owned those lots though was actually a streetcar guy. A streetcar gripman, somebody who worked on streetcars, [00:09:00] Charles H. Taylor. And I think he might have had bought the land so that it was a larger plot of land. But we think it was this guy W.A. Merralls who built the conservatory. He was British and I think he had a background in the mining industry and he invented gasoline motors. You know, one of these tinkerers. Yeah, sort of Thomas Edison types. But definitely was into aircraft and biplanes and tried to form a company.\nDavid: Okay, so, Taylor buys the land from Joost, and then Merralls builds a conservatory.\nDavid: And then what?\nWoody: And originally it was an octagon building, but it had a couple of wings on each side. And he was interested, I think, in exotic plants and trees. And he just created this pleasure ground essentially as part of the land. And he had a separate house that was part of it all.\nDavid: But he, so he got killed?\nWoody: He did. He got run over by a train. [00:10:00]\nWoody: And then his wife, his widow, her name was Temperance. And this is going to give you an idea of what her plans are for the conservatory. She wanted to create a sanitarium there, using the conservatory building as a sanitarium.\nDavid: It's just a part of it. I mean, it's not that big.\nWoody: Like a private sanitarium, I think, where people go, and this was a sanitarium, a place where alcoholics could go and sort of dry out. So, she was very much against alcohol.\nDavid: So, Sunnyside was out in the country.\nDavid: Only there was a couple of buildings, a few buildings out there.\nWoody: A lot of farm land.\nDavid: A lot of farms.\nWoody: And, you know, back then people didn't know about alcoholism as much as they know now. And so, there were all these different methods and treatments that people would try to come up with to cure it. You know, it wasn't thought of, you know, we didn't have the 12 steps and programs and all that. So, this was one of these treatment programs she came up with. She wanted to [00:11:00] call it the Sunnyside Laboratories and have sort of a, a treatment program for alcoholics using the conservatory building.\nDavid: Huh? Well, I'm glad I didn't know that when my acquaintances were drinking beer there.\nWoody: They wouldn't have been inspired to stop?\nDavid: No. But so what, but she ran out of money?\nWoody: Right. Right. She went bankrupt.\nDavid: And she lost the whole place.\nWoody: Right. Lost it to the bank. I think she was foreclosed on.\nWoody: That's right. And then in, I think in 1920s roughly, new people moved in, and that's where I think that dog story came from. The people who bought it after her supposedly bought the land from the bank and then found out there was this big conservatory building in the middle of the patch of wilderness next to their house. So, that was the Van Becks, that was their name, Van Becks. But they were kind of well-known in the Sunnyside. They were, I guess you could consider, like they had the biggest place and the biggest land. And so, they had a [00:12:00] lot of influence on improvements in trying to make the Sunnyside a nicer neighborhood at the time.\nDavid: Right. And over the time, I mean, so the original person, Taylor, bought seven lots around and built the, or did not build the conservatory, but had, it was a big plot of land. And over time, these successive owners each built their own homes and subdivided those, I mean, not subdivided, but they were all lots by themselves.\nDavid: And so, the conservatory wilderness land those lots, that it was on, successively got smaller. The park.\nWoody: Yeah. Yeah. And actually, the guy, one of the owners down the line, the old house that was part of the conservatory land\u2026\nWoody: Actually got separated out at some point and was not part of the land anymore. And the guy who kind of helped fix up the conservatory, cause remember we're talking about a glass building at some point\u2026\nDavid: Well, it's made of wood with a lot of windows.\nWoody: Right. But it had had been broken and people were throwing rocks through them. And this guy, [00:13:00] Walter Anderson, who owned the land, did a lot of restoration, which included boarding up a lot of the window openings, because he was just trying to keep it up and make it a nicer looking building. He died in 1973 and his wife sold the property to another couple for $70,000. This is great. In 1973, you could buy all this land for $70,000.\nDavid: Yeah, but we only made a dollar and a quarter an hour.\nWoody: Yeah, I had a paper route. No, I didn't have paper route. Anyway, the guy who bought it from them for $70,000, they wanted to tear down the conservatory because you know, it's valuable land. You could build a bunch of houses and stuff. And that really got the Sunnyside neighborhood all riled up. They formed a neighborhood association. And they really fought to save the building, and that's when it was made a landmark. Remember I said it was a landmark in \u201875?\nDavid: Oh yeah. City Landmark Number 78.\nWoody: Yeah. Anyway, so there was a big push to save it. There was still some scares about it being [00:14:00] demolished. The wings got taken down in the late \u201870s.\nDavid: But there's some weird stuff there. I mean, it's a landmark in 1975.\nDavid: But then the owner still was able to secure a demolition permit in 1978?\nWoody: There was some mistakes made, I think. I think it was some bureaucratic errors. He wasn't supposed to get the demo permit, cause it was a city landmark.\nDavid: Right. So\u2026\nWoody: He did, and he started tearing it down.\nDavid: Today there's one wing on the eight-sided building, but in 1975 there were two wings. There was another wing on the other side.\nDavid: And in 1978, the other wing that's gone now was demolished by the owner in that sketchy demolition permit.\nWoody: Yeah. It shouldn't have been issued. And then a lot of the original window sashes, a lot of stuff was done to it to kind of tear off original material. But it was saved, thank goodness, in the late \u201870s, early \u201880s. And then, that's when the park was sort of added to the Rec and Park [00:15:00] land. Because the building was saved as a, in a sense, as a landmark, but all the land around it wasn't a park until the 1980s. And, but as you know David, city parks have a way of sometimes going through good times and bad times.\nWoody: And so, even after it was a city park, we have a city landmark. People like you were going in that park.\nDavid: Who appreciated the place for its solitude and a pastoral environment.\nWoody: Yes. So, it was a good place for teenagers trying to drink, to hide in the bushes and drink. Right? So\u2026\nDavid: It wasn't a convenient place for me to go. Okay. I mean, I went there because I had an interest in history. I'm like, what's this place? Sunnyside Conservatory.\nWoody: Oh, so you're saying it was your, your interest in history that had you drinking beer in these parks.\nDavid: And my interest in drinking beer.\nWoody: You know, it's funny, we're doing this and I see here on your desk you have a six pack of Rock & Roll beer [00:16:00] that I think probably dates from\u2026\nDavid: 1980, I think.\nWoody: 1980. So, you could have been drinking this Rock & Roll beer. It's all rusty now. You could have been drinking in \u201982, drinking this at the Sunnyside Conservatory.\nDavid: Yeah, it's possible. It's possible.\nWoody: But as I remember, even though in the \u201880s, even into the \u201890s, it was still kind of run down. I think there was still homeless people kind of camping in there occasionally. Vandalism, graffiti. It had kind of fallen on hard times.\nDavid: Yeah, it was all open, as I say, it was open to the elements and, and t was kind of like you're in a gazebo sort of thing. I mean, it wasn't really an enclosed building.\nWoody: Right. But that's changed. And you were at the big dedication. So, there was a bond issue and there was a lot of work put into it. And then in 2009, December 5th, they had the rededication, reopening of the Sunnyside Conservatory. And it's a very different place now, isn't it?\nDavid: Yeah, yeah. It's beautifully remodeled and [00:17:00] restored. It's sealed, it's locked up. So, the inside and outside is taken care of. There's a community group there that takes care of the gardens and you can have, you can have your party there and you could still drink beer there, but you have to clear it with the group and probably have to pay something too.\nWoody: Get a permit?\nDavid: Yeah. Get a permit.\nWoody: But yeah, it's like a neighborhood gathering space now, a community space where you can go and have a party or an event.\nDavid: And the gardens are open to the public all the time. And I'm not sure about the inside of the conservatory, whether that's open every day or not, but it's a really beautiful spot over in the Sunnyside.\nWoody: They did a great restoration, little finial on the top, and the windows, the wood, all the kind of like exposed beams are really neat. So, they did a great job on it. It has a gate to the park.\nWoody: There's a gate to get in, so it's got a little bit more security. But it's really a success story. And it's [00:18:00] really a tribute to the neighbors of the Sunnyside that fought really hard for a long time to get that building and that park fixed up.\nDavid: Absolutely. I'm glad it's there.\nWoody: Yeah, and so if you're in the Sunnyside, if you're driving a Monterey Boulevard, pull over and take a look at the Sunnyside Park there and the Sunnyside Conservatory. It's the second biggest conservatory, I think, in San Francisco. Think so?\nDavid: Don't quote me. Please don't.\nWoody: That could be another correctable error. So, before we sign off, David, I wanna mention that we're going to have a movie night at the Balboa Theater on Tuesday, May 14th, 2013.\nDavid: That's coming up soon.\nWoody: Yeah. So, buy your tickets, $10, and we're gonna show a lot of old news reels, interesting history minutes from our website. Other things of a historical interest.\nDavid: Right. So, if you enjoy the sort of banter that you hear on the Outside Lands podcast, you will probably enjoy this movie night. Because Woody and I will be crackin\u2019 wise all night.\nWoody: Yeah. [00:19:00]\nDavid: From the stage.\nWoody: Yeah. With our friend Katherine Petrin. But we're gonna show a lot of interesting old history stuff too.

Should we buy a big bottle, and pour the juice into your go-cup for school lunch?\u201d\nMake Financial Concepts Tangible\nTry the \u201cThree Jar Approach.\u201d Label the jars \u201csaving,\u201d \u201cspending,\u201d and \u201cgiving.\u201d Each time your child earns or is gifted money, divide it evenly between the jars. Count the money together when you make a deposit.\nAllow your child to spend the funds in the \u201cspending\u201d jar as they like. Ask your child who they would like to share the \u201cgiving\u201d money with. It may be a religious organization, a charity, or a GoFundMe project. Have them choose a bigger-ticket item or experience to purchase with the accumulated money from the \u201csaving\u201d jar.\nConsider Giving Kids an Allowance\nWill your child have to complete chores to earn money? Will they receive a weekly or monthly allowance? In other words, will they need to manage their money over a shorter period or a longer period of time? Will you extend credit, giving your child an advance on their allowance? Will you charge interest?\nInvolve Kids in Family Budgeting\nShow your child your bills. Explain how much you make an hour and how many hours you have to work to pay a particular bill. Talk about ways you can get lower that bill, such as taking showers instead of baths, opening windows instead of running the air conditioner, or turning off lights when you leave a room.\nIf your family is saving for something, such as a vacation or a pontoon boat, tell your child about it. Have a conversation about how much you put towards the goal and how often. Make a savings chart to keep on the refrigerator or family bulletin board.\nOpen a Bank Account with Farm Bureau Bank\nIf your child has $100, they can open an account with Farm Bureau Bank. Banking services are offered online or by phone, so they can manage their own account from the family computer or a smartphone. They can watch their balance change in real time as they deposit funds, use their debit card, or withdraw money from an ATM. Frequent balance checks teach your child to look out for account fraud. Ready to get started?\nMore Money Management Resources\nThe Federal Financial Literacy and Education Commission has a collection of great resources to teach kids of all ages about personal finances.","metadata":{"date":1708596418000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947473738.92\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240222093910-20240222123910-00399.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9531173706,"token_count":771,"url":"https:\/\/floridafarmbureau.com\/2020\/03\/teach-kids-money-management\/"},"score":4,"id":"33"}
{"text":"Core Values & Issues we care about\nUnity, Representation, and Support\nWe're professional collaborators by the nature of our work, plus our collective slate of candidates is inclusive of Democrats and Independents. We are looking to foster greater communication between the township and the school district.\nUnity means that we provide space and opportunity for everyone at USC, regardless of race, gender, ethnicity, religious, political or sexual orientation. We cannot be united if members of our community - new and old - feel unwelcome, underrepresented, or unable to be themselves in our public spaces.\nThe USC community has grown and evolved in its diversity. We are committed not only to welcoming and celebrating this diversity, but also to seeing it as the rich resource that it is to offer great learning opportunities for our children. This election can make this important community leadership position more balanced and ideologically representative of the township as a whole.\nSupport the staff and empower the experts\nWe will continue to attract, hire, and retain the most highly-qualified school staff and teachers. We will respect them and support them as the educated and well-trained professionals that they are. We will empower them to do the good work they were hired to do. That is, to provide the best possible education to all children using evidence-based practices.\nWe\u2019ve each subscribed to this philosophy in the business world and would bring that to the table as school board directors. This stands in stark contrast to many school districts around the country where school boards and\/or constituents are waging sterile culture wars to the detriment of their students. We want to ensure the staff have health and well-being services, and meaningful opportunities for continuing education. This will ensure that we continue to amplify the tradition of educational excellence that has defined USC schools for many years.\nModernize community engagement\nWe strongly believe in the American ideal of Government of, by, and for the people. We believe that engaging with and hearing from our community is critical to the success of our township and school district. We also know that school board and council meetings are not always convenient for many people in our communities due to busy work and family schedules, so their voices aren't heard. This is a problem we can and will fix.\nWe will put our collective decades of experience in technology (media, communication, and instructional technology) to work, deploying common-sense solutions that ensure more access for everyone. We will work to ensure that all township and school board meetings are webcast with the ability for remote attendees to participate during the community feedback portion. We will develop community surveys and parent feedback surveys when necessary on important issues facing our township and school. We will host ongoing webcast Q&A sessions with our leaders along with developing a Community Digital Engagement Strategy for ongoing feedback and communication. We will answer your emails.\nOpen dialogue is critical to keeping our community and schools safe and thriving. We are looking forward to having that dialogue with all of our neighbors.\nInvest in the Future\nTechnology is changing at an extremely rapid pace and revolutionizing our world. The ever-evolving job market and career paths of today and the future means thinking not only about the tools we use to teach our kids but also the tools we teach them to use (e.g., AI and other forms of digital technology) as this will prepare them to find their place in a new professional world where they may take jobs that don\u2019t exist today. If we want to prepare our children to face the challenges of tomorrow and prepare them to adapt to -- and shape -- a rapidly changing world, we need to make sure that we continue to evaluate what we teach our students and make sure we stay abreast of current trends in educational research, scientific knowledge, and the demands of the occupational world. This does not mean an upheaval of the current curriculum, but rather a careful analysis and forecast of what fresh high school graduates will face when they enter the real world.\nIn the age of information, investing in the future also means making sure our children are equipped, through a robust education, with the critical literacy skills necessary to understand the world they live in: information literacy to understand the messages they are exposed to outside of the school context. Financial literacy and budgeting so that they make wise money choices as they enter adulthood. Civic literacy so that they understand the system of government and how they can be full citizens in the world, that is to say people who can participate in the government of, by, and for the people and for greater justice for all. Interpersonal skills so that they are equipped to navigate today\u2019s world, a world that is multicultural and multilingual, and a world where solutions to the complex problems we face will come from people who are trained to work collaboratively and creatively in a mutually respectful and nurturing manner, both locally and beyond.\nIn sum, investing in the future is enabling our children to solve complex problems to compose their own lives and be active \u201cauthors of understanding\u201d rather than passive \u201crecipients of information\u201d so that they can truly shape the modern world. This takes time, patience, perseverance, poise, and resources.\nWe will not be a board of \u201cyes-people,\u201d accepting the administration's every recommendation without question, but we will perform true due diligence on each proposal, prevent frivolous spending, and represent the best interests of the community residents who fund the district.\nA high-quality education, like the one that USC students receive, takes enormous resources. We will value every tax dollar paid by our community members and ensure that your taxes are spent in a fiscally responsible manner with transparency, while continuing to further improve educational outcomes for our children.","metadata":{"date":1709537975000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947476432.11\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240304065639-20240304095639-00299.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9596589804,"token_count":1160,"url":"https:\/\/www.usc-unites.org\/platform"},"score":2,"id":"34"}

{"text":"Historians and theologians have long recognized that at the heart of the sixteenth-century Protestant Reformation were five declarations, often referred to as the \u2018solas\u2019: sola scriptura, solus Christus, sola gratia, sola fide, and soli Deo gloria. These five statements summarize much of what the Reformation was about, and they distinguish Protestantism from other expressions of the Christian faith. Protestants place ultimate and final authority in the Scriptures, acknowledge the work of Christ alone as sufficient for redemption, recognize that salvation is by grace alone through faith alone, and seek to do all things for God\u2019s glory. In God\u2019s Glory Alone\u2014The Majestic Heart of Christian Faith and Life, renowned scholar David VanDrunen looks at the historical and biblical roots of the idea that all glory belongs to God alone. He examines the development of this theme in the Reformation, in subsequent Reformed theology and confessions, and in contemporary theologians who continue to be inspired by the conviction that all glory belongs to God. Then he turns to the biblical story of God's glory, beginning with the pillar of cloud and fire revealed to Israel, continuing through the incarnation, death, and exaltation of the Lord Jesus Christ, and culminating in Christ's Second Coming and the glorification of his people. In light of these wonderful biblical themes he concludes by addressing several of today's great cultural challenges and temptations\u2014such as distraction and narcissism\u2014and reflecting on how commitment to God's glory alone fortifies us to live godly lives in this present evil age.\n\u201cAnyone who wishes to know the great God of glory must see him through the humility of the cross.\u201d (Page 16)\n\u201cThe Reformers may not have spoken explicitly of \u2018the five solas,\u2019 but the magnification of Christ, grace, faith, Scripture, and God\u2019s glory\u2014and these alone\u2014suffused their theology and ethics, their worship and piety. Christ alone, and no other redeemer, is the mediator of our salvation. Grace alone, and not any human contribution, saves us. Faith alone, and no other human action, is the instrument by which we\u2019re saved. Scripture, and no merely human word, is our ultimate standard of authority. God\u2019s glory alone, and that of no creature, is the supreme end of all things.\u201d (Page 14)\n\u201c\u2018the glory of God is the weight of the majestic goodness of who God is, and the resulting name, or reputation, that he gains from his revelation of himself as Creator, Sustainer, Judge, and Redeemer, perfect in justice and mercy, loving-kindness and truth.\u2019\u201d (Page 23)\n\u201cThe alleged problem is this: the emphasis on God\u2019s glory and God\u2019s glory alone seems to demean human beings. If God\u2019s glory implies humanity\u2019s debasement, is such a God really worthy of our praise?\u201d (Page 18)\n\u201c\u2018Glory to God\u2019 was the theme of the angelic host that announced Jesus\u2019 birth to the shepherds in the field and of the heavenly throng whose songs John recorded in Revelation.\u201d (Page 13)","metadata":{"date":1708636197000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947473824.45\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240222193722-20240222223722-00699.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9382609725,"token_count":689,"url":"https:\/\/www.logos.com\/product\/189275\/gods-glory-alone-the-majestic-heart-of-christian-faith-and-life"},"score":3,"id":"36"}

{"text":"Check out 20 amazing cannabis facts you won\u2019t believe are real.\nWant some fun facts? We do, too! We rounded up a couple of interesting cannabis facts so you can expand your knowledge on this wonderful plant. You might think you know a lot about marijuana, but chances are you don\u2019t know everything. Here are 20 things you didn\u2019t know about cannabis.\n20 Interesting Cannabis Facts\n1. Cannabis Goes Back At Least 12,000 Years\nThis means that cannabis is one of mankind\u2019s oldest crops, according to the book Marihuana: The First Twelve Thousand Years by E. L. Abel.\n2. Weed Was The First Online Sale\nOf course, it was illegal back then. In the early 1970s, Stanford students bought a bag of weed from MIT students. This means that the first product ever sold online was cannabis!\n3. You Can Eat Cannabis Raw\nGranted, it tastes a lot better when prepared with yummy edibles like brownies, bread, or cake. But cannabis can be consumed raw. One more thing is that if you eat it raw, it won\u2019t get you high, but it will provide you with all the medicinal benefits.\n4. Modern-Day Cannabis Is A Lot Stronger\nWe talked about this on the cannabis flower and its influence in the 60s. For one, it\u2019s purer than the illegal \u201chippie weed\u201d that was imported into the United States. And it\u2019s also been cultivated to increase its THC content, so the high you get from marijuana today is a lot stronger than what your parents or grandparents consumed.\n5. Not All Weed Gets You High\nYou read that right. THC is not the same as CBD, which means that the type you choose to consume will have different effects on your body. One will provide all the relaxing and medicinal benefits, while the other will provide the psychoactive effects of the high.\n6. Cannabis Has Tons Of Nicknames\nDue to its illegal status, cannabis is one of the drugs with the most nicknames out there. Weed, ganja, pot, grass, dope, reefer, hash, and even sandwiches if you\u2019re a How I Met Your Mother fan are just a few of the slang terms that have become a part of the beloved cannabis culture.\n7. Shakespeare Smoked Cannabis\nMaybe his source of inspiration? Marijuana residues were found in William Shakespeare\u2019s home, which we believe could have been an enormous aid in writing all the screenplays and poems.\n8. Bob Marley Was Buried With Grass\nThe musical star was buried with his red Gibson guitar, a cannabis bud, and a Bible open on the 23rd Psalm, which reads: \u201cThe Lord is my shepherd, I lack nothing. He makes me lie down in green pastures\u201d. Way to go, Marley.\n9. Cannabis Can Both Relax & Invigorate You\nThis mainly depends on the type of strain you use to consume. Indica is more relaxing and sedating, while Sativa is more uplifting and energetic. You can choose either or a mix or both for interesting results!\n10. You Can\u2019t Lethally Overdose On Cannabis\nDon\u2019t get us wrong. You can overdose on cannabis, which means consuming more than the recommended amount. What it means is that it\u2019s practically impossible for you to consume the amount of cannabis it would take to kill a person.\n11. Cannabis Has Over 100 Active Cannabinoids\nIn fact, over 120. The most famous ones are (you guessed it!) THC and CBD.\n12. LA Is Weed Wonderland\nLos Angeles, aside from being the city of stars, has more marijuana dispensaries than Starbucks. Welcome to LaLa Land.\n13. California Banned First\nA century ago, California was the first state in the United States to ban cannabis. This is a bit ironic when we look at the fun fact above. But it looks like Cali learned its lesson!\n14. Cannabis Can Be Used In Construction\nAnd clothing. And plastic. And the best part is that all of these options are eco-friendly. Learn more about hemp and its benefits here.\n15. Cannabis Can Improve Senior Life Quality\nFrom providing relaxation to becoming a more natural approach to pain relief treatments, cannabis is definitely here to improve the life quality of our senior citizens.\n16. Cannabis Has Medicinal Benefits\nIncluding being a natural analgesic.\n17. Weed Is Beer\u2019s Cousin!\nBeer hops are in the same family of flowering plants as cannabis. We thought the plants looked similar\u2026 and now we know why.\n18. Uruguay Was The Future\nIn 2013, Uruguay became the first country in the world to legalize growing, selling, and consuming cannabis.\n19. USA Grows The Most\nAccording to Civilized Life, the United States is the top marijuana-producing nation in the entire world. Behind it are Morocco, Afghanistan, Mexico, and Colombia. Who would have thought?\n20. George Washington Grew Cannabis\nThat\u2019s right. The first president of the United States of America grew hemp. His farms at Mount Vernon were used to grow hemp in order to make paper, rope, sail canvas, clothing, and fishing nets.\nSo there you have it! 20 very interesting and fun cannabis facts you probably didn\u2019t know. If you would like to know more about CBD and cannabis use in general, then one of our certificate programs & courses may suit your curious mind.

{"text":"The failure of countrywide basic literacy campaigns to enhance social mobility has led to the promotion and development of localized, comprehensive functional literacy campaigns. These campaigns are particularly applicable to marginalized groups; as they aim to empower communities by providing them with the necessary skills to navigate their socioeconomic and political environments. This qualitative study examines the long-term impact of one such functional literacy campaign on the semi-nomadic pastoral Van Gujjar community. I use the Assets, Opportunity Structure, and Degrees of Empowerment (DOE) method to investigate community members\u2019 perceptions of the level of political empowerment that followed their participation in a functional literacy program. Participatory Rural Appraisal(PRA) techniques such as focus groups(n3), semi-structured interview (n30), observation, and key informant interviews(n3) provide a comprehensive understanding of the perceived link between functional literacy and political empowerment in the Van Gujjar community.

{"text":"Latte purists, before you roll your eyes at the golden milk latte trend, know this is not just another coffee fad lurking in the glittery shadow of the unicorn-frap!\nFact: Turmeric has a long history of healing and has been consumed in hot-drink form in India for centuries. I learned this from Deepi Harish\u2019s article, Turmeric Was India\u2019s Cure-All Long Before Hipsters Made It a Latte. Turmeric \u201clattes\u201d were something her mom, who grew up in the village of Punjab, called haldi doodh, which translates to turmeric milk.\nHarish writes, \u201cTurmeric is often prescribed by Ayurvedic practitioners to support the blood, liver, joints, immune system and digestive tract. In India, about 80 per cent of the rural population depends on traditional Ayurvedic medicine.\u201d So, making drinks out of it was a simple way to reap the health benefits\u2013and it\u2019s not surprising that, after ghee, coconut oil and chai, turmeric would find its place in the Western wellness world.\nWill your local indie coffee dealer (see a few of them below) be able to serve you a drink that heals what ails you? Maybe not like the haldi doodh in India, but consuming more turmeric, latte or not, could definitely help you feel more vital. According to Ayurveda, turmeric balances the three doshas; vata, pitta, and kapha (the energies that circulate throughout the body and govern our activity).\nHolistic healing homeboy and Indian native Deepak Chopra refers to turmeric as a pharmacy unto itself. It is naturally anti-inflammatory and antioxidant, which supports our physical health in a host of ways. So let the golden milk trend grow and evolve. But if you want to start with the latte, peep this recipe from Toronto dealer Nutbar\u2019s kitchen:\n1 cup milk (or milk alternative of your choosing)\n3\/4 tsp turmeric\n1\/4 tsp cinnamon\n1 tbsp raw honey\n1\/2 tsp vanilla\na pinch of black pepper\nCombine all ingredients except milk, add a few tablespoons of hot water to mixture and stir to make a paste.

{"text":"Canning Foods At High Altitude\nIf you live at altitudes higher than 1000 feet above the sea, canning foods must be a whole different ball game for you. Making jams and preserves, veggies and tomato soups, or anything else is a unique experience when living so far above the surface of the sea.\nWe are here to help you figure out why that\u2019s the case and how you can make up for the higher elevation.\nHigh Altitude Canning \u2013 What\u2019s Different?\nThe boiling point of water changes due to lower atmospheric pressure and lower boiling temperature at higher altitudes. This affects your canning abilities because the boiling water bath method depends on the temperature and the food\u2019s high acidity to safely preserve it.\nUp until 1000 feet above sea level, the boiling temperature for water is at 212 \u00b0F. But it changes to 207.1 \u00b0F at 2500 feet.\nIn water bath canning, ensuring these temperature levels maintains food safety; making up for the difference is essential. If the boiling water isn\u2019t hot enough, the foods won\u2019t be effectively sterilized.\nPressure canning also requires temperatures higher than that of boiling water to preserve low-acid foods safely. Also, expect the light atmospheric pressure at high altitudes to affect pressure canning, which means you need to increase pressure accordingly.\nHigh-Altitude Canning Adjustments\nThere are two types of canning that you need to take care of when making adjustments to the recipes at high altitudes:\n- At high altitudes, add processing time for boiling water bath canning\n- At high altitudes, raise the pressure for pressure canning\nBoiling Water Bath\nThe altitude you are on and the recipe\u2019s processing time determine the adjustments you have to make with the boiling water bath canning.\nFor a recipe with a processing time of over 20 minutes:\n- 1,001\u20133,000 feet above sea level: raise time by 5 minutes\n- 3,001\u20136,000 feet above sea level: raise time by 10 minutes\n- 6,001\u20138,000 feet: raise time by 15 minutes\n- 8,001\u201310,000 feet: increase time by 20 minutes\nFor a recipe with a processing time of under 20 minutes:\n- 1,001\u20136,000 feet above sea level: raise time by 5 minutes\n- Over 6,000 feet: increase time by 10 minutes\nIn the case of pressure canning recipes, you will usually find a processing pressure of 10 pounds-per-square-inch gauge (PSIG) compared to the surrounding environment. This pressure is essential to produce a 240 degrees F boiling temperature at sea level.\nA deadweight gauge pressure canner raises the pressure to 15 PSIG at over 1000 feet sea level.\nUse the following pressure increments for dial gauge pressure canners.\n- 1,001\u20133,000 feet: raise pressure by 2 PSIG\n- 3,001\u20135,000 feet: increase pressure by 3 PSIG\n- 5,001\u20137,000 feet: increase pressure by 4 PSIG\n- Above 7,000 feet: increase pressure by 5 PSIG\nSome Tips For High Altitude Canning\nTo save your time while canning at high altitudes, follow our tips:\n- At high altitudes, jellies reach the gelling stage faster, and the candy thermometer does not help get an accurate reading. Remember that a gel point at sea level is different than that above 1000 feet and gives a pasta-like consistency instead.\n- At high altitudes, canning sessions take longer because of the higher boiling point of water. So keep in mind that both types of canning take a longer time to get ready than you anticipate.\nIf you live on high altitudes and want to enjoy delicious canned foods, don\u2019t be bummed about the recipe\u2019s requirements.\nFollow our guide to safely use the food by making some easy adjustments to the recipes.

{"text":"The Cubical Lattice Concept\nOne of the first things that had to be determined was how best to place the uranium in the reactor. Fermi and Szilard suggested placing the uranium in a matrix of the moderating material, thus forming a cubical lattice of uranium. This placement appeared to offer the best opportunity for a neutron to encounter a uranium atom. Of all the materials which possessed the proper moderating qualities, graphite was the only one which could be obtained in sufficient quantity of the desired degree of purity.\nThe study of graphite-uranium lattice reactors was started at Columbia in July, 1941, but after reorganization of the uranium project in December, 1941, Arthur H. Compton was placed in charge of this phase of the work, under the Office of Scientific Research and Development, and it was decided that the chain reactor program should be concentrated at the University of Chicago. Consequently, early in 1942 the Columbia and Princeton groups were transferred to Chicago where the Metallurgical Laboratory was established.\nIn a general way, the experimental nuclear physics group under Fermi was primarily concerned with getting a chain reaction going; the chemistry division organized by F. H. Spedding (later in turn under S. K. Allison, J. Franck, W. C. Johnson, and T. Hogness) with the chemistry of plutonium and with separation methods, and the theoretical group under E. P. Wigner with designing production piles. However, the problems were intertwined and the various scientific and technical aspects of the fission process were studied in whatever group seemed best equipped for the particular task.\nAt Chicago, the work on subcritical size piles was continued. By July, 1942, the measurements obtained from these experimental piles had gone far enough to permit a choice of design for a test pile of critical size. At that time, the dies for the pressing of the uranium oxides were designed by Zinn and ordered made. It was a fateful step, since the entire construction of the pile depended upon the shape and size of the uranium pieces.\nIt was necessary to use uranium oxides because metallic uranium of the desired degree of purity did not exist. Although several manufacturers were attempting to produce the uranium metal, it was not until November that any appreciable amount was available. By mid-November, Westinghouse Electric and Manufacturing Company, Metal Hydrides Company, and F. H. Spedding, who was working at Iowa State College at Ames, Iowa, had delivered several tons of the highly purified metal which was placed in the pile, as close to the center as possible. The procurement program for moderating material and uranium oxides had been handled by Norman Hilberry. R. L. Doan headed the procurement program for pure uranium metal.\nAlthough the dies for the pressing of the uranium oxides were designed in July, additional measurements were necessary to obtain information about controlling the reaction, to revise estimates as to the final critical size of the pile, and to develop other data. Thirty experimental subcritical piles were constructed before the final pile was completed.","metadata":{"date":1709001516000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947474670.19\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240227021813-20240227051813-00799.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9714081287,"token_count":626,"url":"https:\/\/www.atomicarchive.com\/history\/first-pile\/firstpile_04.html"},"score":4,"id":"46"}
{"text":"Black Friday \u2013 a story that starts with a crash, continues with discontent and ends in excitement\nIt is one of the characterizing events of a digital era. These days, it involves people from all around the world in a consumerist pursuit of happiness. But what\u2019s the complete story of Black Friday?\n2019, 29th of November, Black Friday. One of the largest shopping events in the world, with a worldwide coverage in the last decade. Busy shoppers, busy stores, complex marketing campaigns elaborated within the offices of large enterprises and businesses across six continents. Consumerism and technology seem to be good friends, since technology facilitates globalization and globalization flattens the demand by universalizing trends, products, services and, ultimately, people.\n1869, 24th of September, Black Friday. In an attempt to speculate in the gold price, two Wall Street investors recklessly determined a crash on the stock market. Even if, in the end, they didn\u2019t suffer any punishment or economic loss, the crash affected the US economy for the next following years, leaving many people bankrupt. Subsequently, the public opinion started to refer to this date as the \u201cBlack Friday\u201d.\nHowever, the term has a positive connotation nowadays, so you will probably wonder how that happened and also how Black Friday became associated with shopping? Well, it all started with a correlation between the shopping season and the holiday season. The official debut? The day after Thanksgiving, or the last Friday in November.\nAt the turn of the twentieth century, the day after Thanksgiving was marked as the starting point of the holiday shopping season, with thematic parades and Santa Clauses metaphorically announcing that shops, companies or retailers can finally start advertising their businesses. But hold on for a little longer, we\u2019re not there yet.\nAs revenue, hence profit, is one of the fundamental aspects of most businesses, a shorter holiday shopping season can seriously affect the market. It happened in 1939, when Thanksgiving fell during the fifth week of November, which would\u2019ve shortened the season. The matter reached Franklin Delano Roosevelt\u2019s ears, so he postponed Thanksgiving by one week. The immediate reaction of the public opinion was negative, as the change interfered with everyone\u2019s holiday plans. However, two years later, Thanksgiving was settled by law on the fourth Thursday of November.\nWith a fixed date now in mind, everyone knew what to expect for and how to prepare, every year. But society was constantly expanding, information was spreading faster and cities were becoming more and more crowded. In post-war times of peace and prosperity, economy was growing and people were eager to spend.\nTherefore, during the sixties, the day after Thanksgiving started to cause more problems in terms of order and smoothness. Handling traffic jams, crowded streets and enthusiast groups of people required more law enforcement was logically required. That\u2019s why police officers were not so happy about the scale and proportion of these events. For some of these policemen, especially for those in Philadelphia, this day got the name of \u201cBlack Friday\u201d. Eventually, as every publicity is good publicity, the media saw the opportunity and turned the connotation of this name into a positive one, over the following decades. Today, we all know how it is. What\u2019s more to it is that many retailers extended the Black Friday period, so now it can start before or end after the fourth Friday of November.\n2019, 29th of November, Black Friday. Almost hypnotised by discounts and advertisement campaigns, people feel the effects of an age of consumerism, as they comply to an urge to buy everything \u2013 from electronic gadgets (smartphones, laptops, gaming consoles) to washing machines, microwaves and in some places even frying pans or chainsaws. All of this in a sort of pursuit of happiness, which takes place both online and offline. Apparently, at the end of the day, everyone is happy: people feel like they\u2019ve fulfilled a goal with their new products and companies are satisfied with their successful campaigns, growing profits and thicker wallets. This is how the holiday shopping season starts.\nSubscribe to the Blog\nJoin for the latest tech, design and industry news straight to your inbox.\nOur UX team designs customer experiences and digital products that your users will love.","metadata":{"date":1708627113000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947473824.13\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240222161802-20240222191802-00598.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9670284986,"token_count":885,"url":"https:\/\/www.uxconnections.com\/black-friday-a-story-that-starts-with-a-crash-continues-with-discontent-and-ends-in-excitement\/"},"score":3,"id":"47"}
{"text":"Picture it\u2014you design an exciting, collaborative lesson that that you\u2019re sure your students are going to love. The best part about it? They get to work together in groups! Everything is going amazingly until:\n- One group has that slacker who\u2019s not doing their fair share.\n- Another group has that student does all of the work while the others look on.\n- And in the end, one group\u2019s project turns out awful, and the group turns on each other.\nWhile working cooperatively with others is an important life skill, it can definitely be tricky when it involves kids whose abilities (and attitudes) vary wildly. Middle school teacher Sara recently wrote into our WeAreTeachers HELPLINE! with a group work dilemma involving one student who was bulldozing the other members of the group. Not only that, but when she was recently absent the group had no access to the project\u2019s materials and no idea how to proceed without her. Here are some words of wisdom our teachers offered to conduct successful group work in the classroom.\nTop \ud83d\udcf8 credit from Beyond Traditional Math\u2014check out their site for additional tips for group work!\n1. Assign roles.\n\u201cAssign each student in the group a unique role so that everyone has to work together to make the project a success,\u201d said Jaime L. Being solely responsible for a portion of the work gives students ownership over the project\u2019s success. The nature of the project will dictate the roles, but some examples are: proofreader, fact-checker, and scribe.\n2. Make sure every group member has access.\nTechnology makes it easy for each group member to have access to all work and collaborate. \u201cI have each member share any and all work on Google drive,\u201d advised Sonja L. This helps facilitate the notion of working together and contributing equally.\nIf your students don\u2019t have daily access to technology, make sure they have a system to store hard copies of their group work in the classroom. \u201cWhen I do group work, I have a work-in-progress folder for each class. That way, they always have the work even if someone is absent.\u201d \u2014Karen K.\n3. Ask for input.\nBecky M. shares, \u201cAt the end of a project, I have each student write a reflection. What was easy about the project? What was challenging? What grade would you give each person in your group, and why?\u201d Let students know the contents of their letter will remain confidential but will also factor into their final grade. Listening to your students can help give you insider information about who really worked and who didn\u2019t. It can also help you structure your project differently next time, if necessary.\n4. And grade accordingly.\nInclude a participation grade into your rubric and make a point of observing each group\u2019s activity during class. When students know that their grade is dependent on their participation, they are more likely to work toward the project\u2019s success. \u201cIf I see that only one member is doing most of the work, I absolutely adjust grades to incorporate that information,\u201d says Sonja L..\n5. Speak to outliers privately.\nSlackers are easy to redirect, but students who can\u2019t help themselves from taking over have their own set of issues that need addressing too. \u201cSometimes high-achieving students are afraid of letting others do any work for fear it won\u2019t be good enough,\u201d says Mark J., \u201cand so they control all of the work, which leads to them doing everything.\u201d If that\u2019s the case, talk with the student about the importance of collaboration and letting go.\nWhat do you do to ensure successful group work in the classroom?

{"text":"A Chinese Long March 2D rocket lifts off with the Shiyan 13 satellite. Credit: CASC\nChina launched a Long March 2D rocket Monday with another classified satellite, deploying the spacecraft into a polar orbit on the first of more than 40 Chinese Long March rocket missions planned in 2022.\nThe Long March 2D rocket took off from the Taiyuan launch base in Shanxi province of northern China at 0435 GMT Sunday (11:35 p.m. EST Sunday), according to the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corp. or CASC.\nLiftoff occurred at 10:35 a.m. Beijing time Monday.\nCASC, China\u2019s largest state-owned space industry contractor, said the Long March 2D rocket delivered the Shiyan 13 satellite into orbit. Chinese officials did not disclose details about the purpose of the mission, other than claiming Shiyan 13 will be used for space environment data collection and technology tests.\nChina\u2019s series of Shiyan satellites, which began launching in 2004, have been used for technology demonstrations and experiments. Many of the Shiyan missions to date have likely had a military purpose.\nThe 134-foot-tall (41-meter) Long March 2D rocket that carried Shiyan 13 into orbit lifted off with more than 650,000 pounds of thrust from its hydrazine-fueled first stage engines. Heading south from Taiyuan over Chinese territory, the two-stage launcher climbed through the atmosphere accelerated to a speed of nearly 5 miles (8 kilometers) per second.\nThe U.S. military, which publishes orbital data online, said it tracked the Shiyan 13 satellite in an orbit between 287 miles and 309 miles (463 by 498 kilometers) at an inclination of 97.4 degrees to the equator.\nChinese officials declared the launch a success, and the U.S. military tracking data confirmed the mission reached orbit.\nCASC said in a statement that the launch was the first of more than 40 missions the organization plans to perform this year. CASC builds and oversees the Long March rocket family, China\u2019s most-flown launch vehicle.\nMore than 15 of the launches will use the Long March 2D rocket configuration, according to CASC. The Long March 2D is designed to carry payloads weighing up to 2,900 pounds (about 1.3 metric tons) into a polar sun-synchronous orbit.\nAccomplishing 15 or more Long March 2D launches this year would set an annual record for this type of rocket.\nOther major Chinese space missions scheduled for launch in 2022 include six Long March rocket flights to build and outfit China\u2019s space station.\nThe station\u2019s Tianhe core module launched last April on a heavy-lift Long March 5B rocket. China launched a Long March 7 rocket with a Tianzhou cargo ship in May to dock with the Tianhe module, delivering supplies for first three astronauts who launched to the station in June.\nThat crew returned to Earth in September, the same month China launched another Tianzhou cargo mission.\nThree more astronauts on China\u2019s Shenzhou 13 spacecraft launched and docked with the station\u2019s Tianhe core module in October to begin a six-month stay, the longest China human spaceflight mission to date.\nThis year, China aims to launch two more large space station modules \u2014 each weighing more than 20 tons at launch \u2014 on Long March 5B rockets from the Wenchang space center on Hainan Island.

A liter is a unit of volume in the metric system, and it\u2019s equal to 1000 milliliters. An ounce, on the other hand, is a unit of volume in the imperial system, and it\u2019s equal to 28.35 milliliters or 1\/128th of a U.S. gallon.\nHow Many Ounces in 1.2 Liters?\nTo convert liters to ounces, you\u2019ll need to know that one liter is equal to 33.814 ounces. Therefore, to calculate how many ounces are in 1.2 liters, you\u2019ll need to multiply 1.2 by 33.814. The answer, in this case, is 40.5768 ounces.\nHow Many Ounces Are in 1\/2 Liter?\nTo convert 1\/2 liter to ounces, you\u2019ll need to multiply 0.5 by 33.814. The result is 16.907 ounces.\nHow Many Ounces in 1 Liter?\nIf you want to know how many ounces are in one liter, you don\u2019t have to do any calculations because we know that one liter equals 33.814 ounces. So, if you have one liter of liquid, it\u2019s the same as having 33.814 ounces.\nHow Many Liters in 1 Ounce?\nTo convert ounces to liters, you\u2019ll need to divide the number of ounces by 33.814. For example, if you have 16 ounces of liquid and want to know how many liters that is, you\u2019ll need to divide 16 by 33.814. The answer is 0.473 liters.\nHow to Measure Liquid in Ounces and Liters\nIn cooking, measuring the right amount of liquid is crucial to ensure the recipe\u2019s success. You can measure liquid in both ounces and liters, depending on the recipe\u2019s requirements. Measuring cups and spoons are widely used to measure liquid in ounces, while measuring jugs or cups are used for liters. Here are some tips for measuring liquid:\nMeasuring Liquid in Ounces\n- Fill the measuring cup to the desired amount, holding the cup at eye level to ensure accuracy.\n- Avoid shaking the cup to level the liquid as it can introduce more air into the mixture.\nMeasuring Liquid in Liters\n- Place the measuring jug or cup on a flat surface and make sure it\u2019s stable.\n- Pour the liquid slowly to the desired amount, making sure it\u2019s level with the markings on the jug or cup.\nConversion Table for Liters to Ounces\nTo make the conversion process easier, we\u2019ve created a table with some common conversions of liters to ounces. You can refer to this table whenever you need to make a quick conversion.\nWhy is it important to measure accurately?\nCooking is a science, and the success of the recipe depends on accurate measurement. If you add too much or too little liquid to a recipe, it can affect the texture, flavor, and consistency. For instance, if you add too much liquid to a cake recipe, it might turn out dense and chewy. On the other hand, if you add too little liquid, the cake might be dry and crumbly. Therefore, it\u2019s essential to measure accurately to ensure the recipe\u2019s success.\nIn conclusion, converting liters to ounces is simple if you know the conversion rate. One liter is equal to 33.814 ounces, and you can use this conversion rate to make any necessary calculations. It\u2019s essential to measure liquid accurately in cooking to ensure the recipe\u2019s success. Now that you\u2019ve learned how to convert liters to ounces, you can use this knowledge in your cooking and baking endeavors!\nFrequently Asked Questions\n- How many ounces are in 1.2 liters?

{"text":"The Right Business Lawyer for My Business\nWhen I started my business 3 years ago, I knew absolutely nothing. A friend connected me with Maura, and I am glad they did. Maura helped me with everything I needed to start my business, from the creation of the corporation and govermental requirements, to contracts with vendors and employees. Now, with 19 employees, she conitnues to offer advice and counsel to ensure I stay out of trouble. But if am ever in a lawsuit, I know I can count on her. She is, without a doubt, the right lawyer for me and my busines and I can\u2019t thank her enough.\nBrian M, Pompano Beach\nShe Helped Me with a BAD Real Estate Situation\nI was in a bad situation with the office and warehouse space I had leased. Ultimately, I needed to sue the property management company and Maura was a pro throughout. While nobody likes to go through that type of stuff, she made it as good as possible with a very favorable outcome. Then, she reviewed my next series of leases to ensure that never happens again. At this point, I think of her and one of the team and call her with anything and everything. She is fair, smart and saavy. She is awesome.\nSandy F, Hollywood\nShe Saved the Deal!\nWhen I moved to Florda and decided to buy my next business, I had planned on hiring a larger firm that came well recommended to handle the transaction. My neighbor suggested I speak with Maura before I did. We met and she was great, but I was still reluctant of going with a one person firm and went with the larger firm. Big mistake. Everything with the deal was going badly and the other side was ready to walk away. On a whim, I called Maura and asked if she could get involved. She did, and within a 48 hours the deal was back on track and we closed 2 weeks later. I truly believe that the deal would not have happened had Maura not gotten involved. I will never judge a firm\u2019s capability by their size and I will be her client for as long as she will have me.\nJon F, Dania Beach","metadata":{"date":1708571098000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947473690.28\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240222030017-20240222060017-00198.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9884818196,"token_count":457,"url":"https:\/\/mmbpa.com\/testimonials\/"},"score":0,"id":"54"}

{"text":"NASA\u2019s Hubble Telescope has captured an image of the lenticular galaxy NGC 3489, 30 million light-years away. This galaxy, exhibiting traits of both spiral and elliptical galaxies, houses a Seyfert type active galactic nucleus, allowing its surrounding galaxy to remain visible despite the black hole\u2019s radiation emissions.\nThis image of the lenticular galaxy NGC 3489 was captured by the Hubble Space Telescope. Lenticular galaxies aren\u2019t quite spiral galaxies or elliptical galaxies. They lie somewhere in between, exhibiting traits of both. Lenticular galaxies have a central bulge of tightly packed stars and a thin, circular disk of stars, gas, and dust, like spiral galaxies, but they lack arms. And like elliptical galaxies, lenticular galaxies have older stellar populations and little ongoing star formation.\nNGC 3489 has an active galactic nucleus, or AGN. The AGN sits at the center of the galaxy, is extremely bright, and emits radiation across the entire electromagnetic spectrum as the black hole devours material that gets too close to it.\nThis lenticular galaxy is a Seyfert galaxy, which is a class of AGN that is dimmer than other types of AGNs. They generally don\u2019t outshine the rest of the galaxy, so the galaxy surrounding the black hole is clearly visible. Other types of AGNs emit so much radiation that it is almost impossible to observe the host galaxy.\nNGC 3489 is about 30 million light-years away in the constellation Leo.","metadata":{"date":1709557034000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947476442.30\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240304101406-20240304131406-00399.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9017857313,"token_count":314,"url":"https:\/\/scitechdaily.com\/hubbles-stunning-glimpse-into-a-rare-galactic-hybrid\/"},"score":4,"id":"56"}
{"text":"What is it about miniature representations that make our hearts explode with happiness? It might be the amount of work and patience that goes into each piece, or it might be the sheer size of it. Whatever it is, we\u2019re always delighted to run into miniature artists.\nMost recently, we\u2019ve come across Dina Brodsky\u2019s miniature paintings. As it turns out, painting small comes naturally to Brodsky. \u201cWhen I paint small I\u2019m like a fish in water,\u201d she shared with Whitehot Magazine. \u201cI am much less comfortable painting on a larger scale, and very few of my large works hold up as well as the miniatures.\u201d\nHer miniatures include representations of natural landscapes, animals, and architecture. There\u2019s also a series dedicated to seemingly empty rooms, finely painted\u2014a sort of peephole, presenting snapshots of everyday life.\nAccording to Brodsky, her painting technique relies on a combination of classical oil painting techniques (15th century Northern Renaissance methods and 17th-century Venetian techniques) alongside contemporary materials such as mylar and plexiglass.\n\u201cWhen I was studying, the things I had trouble with had more to do with drawing, proportion, perspective, anatomy, architecture,\u201d she notes. \u201cI feel like I am still catching up and trying to master a lot of those things. But color has always come organically.\u201d\nBorn in Minsk, Belarus, Brodsky moved to the US in 1991 where she studied at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, before earning her MFA at the New York Academy of Art.

{"text":"My shopping cart\nYour cart is currently empty.Continue Shopping\nAs much as one may plan, there are certain things one can only prepare for. Truthfully speaking, one can only demand things from businesses, not people. Bride and Grooms usually encounter difficult wedding guests on what should be their special day, an invitation that should be taken as an honor. Unfortunately, some guests do not understand the value of attending a wedding. Here is our list of the worst wedding guest types.\nThere\u2019s a reason why wedding invitations are a huge industry: bride and grooms carefully plan who they want attending their wedding. Unfortunately, not everyone who is invited RSVPs, or those who do attend may bring more attendees than allowed. In both instances, it can cause a few issues.\nOne of the main benefits of using wedding invitations is to determine how many people will attend your wedding. You ask possible attendees to RSVP in advance in order to estimate how many wedding guests you will have, where to seat them, and whether some guests will not attend. If someone isn\u2019t attending but you have another guest who may want to bring one or two more guests, the bride and groom can decide to allow the extra guests since another guest declined.\nHaving an accurate number of wedding guests is crucial since your venue most likely has a limit on guests as well as an average cost per guest. Out of 100 sent out invitations, roughly 60 people RSVP. On the day of your wedding, you may be surprised to find out that there are almost 150 people in the room! Some guests may have missed the number of allowed guests on their invitation and figure they could bring a family member or two. Especially applicable for guests with children, parents with newborns will most likely attend as a family while young children could potentially be guests at your wedding if the parents could not find a babysitter. You may run into issues such as running out of chairs, tables, and food. It could also hurt you financially since you already set your budget to a maximum of 100 people (for example).\nWedding etiquette is extremely important though an unwritten rule. Some guests feel they are attending a party instead of an intimate gathering. They party as if they are in the night club and do not respect the solemnity of the event. Some enjoy the free alcohol and may act inappropriately with your venue staff or guests.\nFor some insensitive relatives, your wedding day is treated as their moment to vent familial grudges. Some may even have the courage of making a scene in your wedding! Ask your closest relatives for whom they feel should be invited. Try to include characters you feel will enjoy your beautiful ceremony and participate in accordingly. Be prepared to exclude certain people from you wedding day even if you are faced with opposition.\nUnfortunately, your bridesmaids can also bring about stress; they may complain about unflattering cut off their dresses, the color and fabric of their gown not matching their skin tone, or how they don\u2019t approve your future husband. The lesson here is whenever picking your bridesmaids, make sure that you know them for a long time. They should be taking care of you during that day and not the other way around.\nSo how to handle these shenanigans? First and foremost, try to inhale and exhale in order to clear your mind. Remember to deal with those unexpected situations with grace and poise. Make sure you have someone to go to when things become too stressful, someone who will listen and calmly help you solve any issues.

{"text":"Are you looking for a free business email you can rely on?\nA business email is one of the best ways to help build trust for your company. It can quickly show people that you are serious about your business. Since your company name will be part of the professional business email address, it can help build your brand further.\nTo add to this, business emails often have better security protocols and come with additional tools to help you manage your emails better.\nIn this article, we will show you 2 of the best ways to get a free custom business email and how to set it up in less than five minutes.\nBut first, let us look at what a business email is.\nWhat is a Business Email?\nA business email uses your own domain name instead of an email service provider like Gmail or Yahoo.com. For example, a business email would be structured like \u2018[email protected]\u2019 for individual email addresses.\nHowever, you can also structure business emails in different ways.\n- Departments: [email protected]\n- Position: [email protected]\n- Function: [email protected]\n- Product: [email protected]\n- Location: [email protected]\n- Role: [email protected]\nYour email client will know exactly who they are talking to from the business email, further building your reputation and trust and, in the long run, improving your SEO and brand.\nBefore we look at how to get a free business email, it is important to understand what to look for when picking the right business email provider.\n- User-friendly interface: Ensure the email service provides an easy-to-use interface for smooth communication and efficient use.\n- Cost of upgrades: Check the pricing structure and potential expenses for upgrading your business email service. Consider features like increased storage, cloud storage, or addons.\n- Additional tools: Look for features such as calendars and task management. Also, check for collaboration tools to help with productivity within the email platform.\n- Backups and restoration: Confirm that the service includes dependable backup and restoration options to safeguard important data in case of accidents or system failures.\n- Support: Check the quality and availability of customer support, ensuring timely assistance for any technical issues or other problems that may arise.\n- Integration: Check for integration with other business tools and software your team uses to help with workflow.\n- Mobile use: Ensure the email platform offers reliable and user-friendly mobile apps, allowing team members to stay connected and productive on the go.\n- Storage space: Check the available storage space and whether it meets your business\u2019s current needs. Also, check if the storage is enough for future growth without incurring excessive costs.\n- Uptime: Verify the email service\u2019s uptime guarantee to minimize disruptions, ensuring your team can access their emails without downtime.\n- Ad-free: Go for an ad-free business email service to maintain a professional appearance and eliminate distractions that may be associated with free email providers.\nWith that said, the 2 options we have provided below meet all the requirements mentioned above. Now, let\u2019s jump into learning how to get a free business address.\nHow to Get a Free Business Email Address\nWith most popular web hosting providers, a business email comes completely free with the hosting plan you get. However, even though the business email is free, you still need to pay for hosting.\nOn the other hand, Google Workspace is a great option if you are just starting out. You do not need a website to host your business email, but you need a domain name, which comes at a cost.\nGoogle Workspace is also not free; it starts at $6 a month. But since you do not need a website hosting service, like in the case of Bluehost, it balances out in the end.\nBut as an added bonus, you can work with both Bluehost and Google Workspace to meet your emailing needs. This relationship ensures you enjoy the best features of both of these business powerhouses.\nFor example, you can access all your favorite Google apps from an easy-to-use Bluehost control panel. This means you can store or back up all your emails and content on the Google Cloud drive offered through this partnership.\nYou can also schedule blog posts, newsletters, and so on with Google Calendar. At the same time, enjoy the speeds, uptime, and security that come with Bluehost emailing and hosting. As a result, working with Bluehost and Google Workspace can help improve team collaboration.\nDespite these many advantages, using the two can lead to an increase in costs, especially if you are just starting out. For this reason, let us focus on how to set up free emails with both tools separately.\nIf you want to jump to one of the methods listed below, click the links below.\n- Method 1: Get a Free Business Email with Bluehost\n- Method 2: Get a Business email with Google Workspace\nMethod 1: Get a Free Business Email with Bluehost\nBluehost is a domain registrar and hosting service popular for offering WordPress sites and eCommerce stores fast speeds and great uptime at affordable prices.\nTo use its free business email service, you first need a domain name, email hosting, and email storage, which come as part of any hosting plan you get from Bluehost.\nBluehost also offers you a limited number of business emails with the basic plan and unlimited business emails with every plan after that.\nThis web hosting company stands out for its many integration abilities, connecting with widely used tools such as Outlook, Gmail, and Mailchimp. This helps you enjoy a smooth and convenient email experience as you can manage your inbox with tools you already know and use.\nAdded to that, Bluehost uses strong data privacy protocols to protect your sensitive information and maintain high security. These privacy measures cover every part of your emailing, providing you with peace of mind.\nIt also comes with advanced spam protection. This feature filters out spam, improving your email score. This, in turn, ensures your content lands in the primary inboxes of people actually interested in your content.\nWith the use of smartphones being so important today for a business owner or a startup, Bluehost allows you to access your email on your phone. Whether iOS or Android, setting up your business email account on your mobile device is easy, ensuring you stay connected wherever you are.\nStep 1: Set Up Hosting and Domain Name\nAs mentioned, the free business emails from Bluehost are tied to a hosting package. Therefore, the first step is to purchase a hosting plan.\nTo do this, head over to the Bluehost website and select Get Started Now, which will redirect you to the pricing page.\nBluehost has four options: Basic, Choice Plus, Online Store, and Pro; select one that suits your business needs and budget.\nAfter you select a plan, Bluehost will ask you to enter your existing website URL or create a new one. Remember that Bluehost gives you a free domain name with every web hosting plan you purchase. If you create a new custom domain at this point, you will not be charged extra.\nBluehost will check the availability of the custom domain name you want to create on the next page. If available, it will be Added To Cart. Follow this up by filling out the Account, Package, and Package Extras information.\nFinally, key in your payment details to purchase and create your account. With Bluehost, you can either pay with a Visa Card, Master Card, American Express Card, Discover Card, or Paypal. This makes it convenient for you to pay with whatever method you find best.\nYou will receive a confirmation email with details on how to log into your Bluehost dashboard and cPanel account, where you will manage your professional email address, hosting, and domain moving forward.\nStep 2. Create a Free Business Email Address\nOnce you confirm your account in your email inbox, head to the Bluehost dashboard. Then, on the left menu, select Cpanel Email, and a popup menu will appear.\nHere, select \u2018Email Accounts,\u2019 then hit Continue to take you to cPanel.\nNext, in your cPanel, find the Email tab. Here, you will find various emailing tools such as Forwarders, Spam filters, Mailing Lists, and more. To get started setting up your free business email, select Email Accounts.\nOn the next page, you will see the number of free emails available, the number of email addresses you have already used, and the option to create a new professional email address. Since this is your first business email, select Create.\nOn the next page, first, select the domain you want to create a business email for in the dropdown menu.\nNext, enter the username for your business email account and then enter or generate a password. Finally, select Create to proceed.\nBluehost should redirect you back to the Email Accounts page automatically. A green popup window should appear, letting you know the process was successful. You should also see the email account you just created added to this page with options to Check Email, Manage, and Connect Devices.\nTo add to that, you will also see the number of used email accounts increase by one and the number of email accounts you can still create displayed. This can help you plan out how you will use your email addresses better.\nIn this case, we have used one email and still have infinite emails we can create.\nCongratulations! You have just created a free business email with Bluehost.\nStep 3. Use the Business Email Account\nWith your free business email account created, the next step is sending and receiving messages.\nTo do this, click Check Email next to the business email name you have just created to be redirected to the webmail interface.\nUnder the Roundcube logo, select Open to log into your inbox.\nHere, you will quickly notice that the webmail interface is very similar to most email inboxes, meaning you will not experience any learning curve.\nIn the left-hand menu, you will see your Inbox, Sent, Draft, Spam, Delete, and Archive folders, like with most other email providers.\nThe top-most menu contains options like Calendar, Contacts, and Settings at the top right. Below that is the email taskbar with options to Refresh, Compose, Reply, Reply All, Forward, Delete, Archive, Mark, and more.\nUse this email interface as you would any other email provider, such as Gmail. You can send and receive emails, archive them, leave emails as drafts, and so on.\nStep 4: Connect Bluehost Email with Gmail or your Device\nSometimes, using webmail may be difficult since it may not be a tool you use every day. As a result, Bluehost allows you to connect your business email to your devices or Gmail for easier management.\nTo connect your devices, go back to the Email Accounts page in cPanel and find the business email you want to connect. At its far right, select Connect Devices.\nOn the setup page, you will find Mail Client Automatic Configuration Scripts. You will see a script to connect your business email to your iOS devices, Mozilla Thunderbird, Outlook, and more. You will also find Mail Client manual settings configurations as well below it.\nTo use Email applications like Microsoft Outlook 2010 and Mail for Windows, you will need to run the configuration scripts. The application will then automatically detect the email account\u2019s settings and also provide detailed instructions to complete the setup process.\nHowever, for iOS, you will also need to set up the Bluehost email account on your device. If you want to learn more about this setup process, follow this tutorial on how to set up email on iOS Devices.\nNext, let us connect the business email to Gmail.\nTo do this, log in to your Gmail account and proceed to the Settings icon. Once selected, you will see a dropdown menu displaying plenty of customization options. Here, select \u2018See All Settings.\u2019\nIn the Settings window that will load next, go to the Accounts and Import tab. Next, scroll to \u2018Check mail from other accounts\u2019 and select Add a Mail Account.\nA new window will appear where you enter your Bluehost business email address in the \u201cEmail address\u201d field. Proceed by selecting \u201cNext.\u201d\nIn the next window, select \u201cImport emails from my other account (POP3)\u201d and then select Next to proceed.\nYou will then be required to enter your username, password, POP Server, and port 995. Finally, select Add Account.\nOnce this is done, Gmail will then send an email to your Bluehost webmail for verification. Open the link and click it to confirm you are the owner.\nFinally, if you want to, configure the Bluehost emails in your Gmail account by adding a label so you can always identify them.\nThe final step is to Save the setting in your Gmail account. You can now receive your business emails from Bluehost right in your Gmail account.\nCongratulations! You have just fully set up a business email for free with Bluehost.\nNext, let us use Google Workspace to set up a business account.\nMethod 2: Get a Business email with Google Workspace\nAs mentioned, if you use Google Workspace to set up your business email, you will need to purchase a plan starting from $6 a month. However, with a 14-day free plan trial to test it out before you make your decision, you have nothing to lose.\nYou can use this cheap business email, even without a business website. However, the costs may add up as you also need to purchase an email domain.\nBut on the bright side, it comes with all the amazing app integrations and productivity tools you have come to expect from Gmail, such as Google Meet, Google Calendar, Google Drive, and more. These tools can help streamline workflow and everyday business activities to help improve productivity.\nOn the other hand, Google Workspace also comes with more business-focused tools such as Google Analytics, Google Tasks, and Google Cloud Search.\nSuch business solutions can help you get more insight into your business, helping you understand your audience better. They can also improve management by simplifying your team\u2019s working experience by reducing the need for many tools.\nNow that you understand more about Google Workspace let\u2019s see how you can create a business email with it.\nStep 1: Get a Google Workspace Plan\nHead to Google Workspace\u2019s official site and select one of the 4 plans offered by clicking the Get Started button.\nOn the next page, enter the Business Name, Number of Employees, and Region.\nIf you are alone or starting out, under \u2018Number of Employees\u2019, we suggest you go with \u2018Just You\u2019 to avoid increased monthly fees.\nFollow this by filling in your name and current email address, and then proceed to the next page.\nNext, you will be asked whether you have a domain name. If you do not have one, Google will direct you on how to purchase one when you select \u2018No, I Need One.\u2019 Again, this will incur additional costs on top of the Google Workspace monthly cost.\nFor this tutorial, we will select \u2018Yes; I have One I Can Use,\u2019 which will start the verification process.\nOn the next page, type in your domain name and hit Next. Google Workspace will first verify your domain name before proceeding to the next page.\nNext, Google Workspace will ask you if you want to stay up to date by sending you occasional tips and offers. Select either \u2018OK\u2019 or \u2018No Thanks.\u2019\nYou will do the same thing on the next and similar page, where Google Workspace will ask you if you would like to educate your users. Here, the tool will send your users information about Google Workspace apps, new features, and tips to help improve productivity. Again, select \u2018OK\u2019 or \u2018No Thanks.\u2019\nOn the new page, you will enter a username and password for your new email. This username will also act as your first business email address. Once you make your decision on the username to use, select Agree and Continue.\nNext, add your personal information and go through the checkout process to pay for the plan you want.\nOnce this is done, select Continue. At this point, you should have successfully created a business email with Google Workspaces.\nStep 2: Verify Domain Name\nNext, use the business email account you have just created to log in to your Google Admin Console (admin.google.com). Here, Google Workspace will show you a tutorial on how to set up your business email. Go through it and make sure you have everything ready.\nThe first step is to verify your domain name. To do this, select Verify Domain on the warning message on your Google Admin Console dashboard homepage.\nIn the next window, you will see 3 options to set up your Google Workspace.\n- Verify your domain\n- Create new users\n- Active Gmail for your domain\nFor this setup tutorial, we will focus on verifying the domain and activating Gmail since we only have one user.\nLet us start the verification process of the domain by selecting \u2018Verify.\u2019\nOnce you hit verify, you will be redirected to a step-by-step verification page with codes to complete the process. Again, read through the steps and ensure you have everything set.\nNext, scroll down the page and copy the verification code provided. This code will always end with mx-verification.google.com. So check on this to make sure you have the right code.\n- Important: Leave this verification page open; use it as a guide and copy the codes.\nNext, head back to your Bluehost dashboard to locate TXT records in the domain settings so you can add the verification code.\nTo do this, go to Domains in your Bluehost dashboard. On the page, scroll down to locate the domain name you want to connect to the business email and select Settings.\nOn the new window, scroll to the bottom and find Advanced Tools. Then, select the dropdown arrow to expand the options. Then, go to \u2018Manage\u2019 Advanced DNS Records on the right.\nIn the next window, select Add Records to access Advanced DNS records. Next, type in the following information in the fields provided.\n- Type: TXT\n- Refers to: @\n- TXT Value: Insert the verification code you copied earlier from Google Workspace ending with mx-verification.google.com.\n- TTL: 1 hour (here, insert the number recommended by your web hosting provider. However, the number will not affect the process.\nFinally, hit Add to add the verification code to the DNS records.\nWith this complete, head back to Google Workspace\u2019s verification page you left open and select Verify my Domain.\nOnce the page reloads, you should be redirected to the Google Workspace setup page. You will notice a blue tick next to your domain name, confirming it is verified.\nYou will also spot a circle chart at the very top, displaying the verification progress. You can use this chart to gauge what else you need to do and how many steps you will need to take.\nStep 3: Activate Gmail\nWith the domain verified, let\u2019s proceed to set up emails to Gmail servers by selecting \u2018Activate.\u2019\nGoogle Workspace will then redirect you to the Activate Gmail process. The first page of this process is the Overview. Here, all you have to do is check the two boxes and select Continue.\nThis will take you to the \u2018Route Emails to Gmail page.\u2019 Here, you will be provided with instructions and codes to add to your Bluehost dashboard.\nAgain, we suggest you leave this page open to ensure you follow all the instructions and add the codes correctly.\nGoogle Workspaces will automatically detect the domain host you are using, offering you better and customized instructions to complete the setup process.\nCarefully read the \u2018Route Emails to Gmail page\u2019 first before you do anything else.\nRemember, these steps can change, so it is important to use the current instructions displaced on the page. Once done, you will see 5 MX records displayed at the bottom of the page. You will copy these codes one by one and add them to your Bluehost dashboard.\nWith your MX records ready and opened, proceed back to your Bluehost account. To change MX records, you will follow the same path you used above for TXT records.\n- Go to Domains, then select the domain you want to use\n- Select Settings.\n- Scroll down to Advanced Settings and select \u2018Manage\u2019 Advanced DNS Records on the right.\n- Finally, hit the Add Records button to open the \u2018Advanced DNS Records\u2019 popup.\nNext, enter the first MX record from the \u2018Route Emails to Gmail\u2019 page, similar to the ones displayed in the screenshot above.\n- Type: MX\n- Refer to: @\n- Mail Server: ASPMX.L.GOOGLE.COM\n- Priority: 1\n- TTL: 1 Hour\nOnce you have filled out all the fields, Select the Add button to connect the code to the MX records.\nRemember that you have 5 MX records you still need to add. Follow the same process as above to add the remaining 4.\nOnce complete, delete any default MX records provided by your host so that the new Google Workspace servers do not conflict with them. After this, the final MX records should look similar to the screenshot below.\nNow, head back to the \u2018Route Emails to Gmail\u2019 page in your Google Workspace dashboard and select \u2018Activate Gmail.\u2019\nNext, Google Workspace will direct you to the Checking Settings page to confirm if you have followed the right process. It will check each individual server address and priority number. It will also check to confirm you deleted the default MX records from your host.\nAfter the check is complete and every MX record is verified, the page will reload to direct you back to the Google Workspace setup page.\nYou will notice the progress chart has increased, and blue check marks next to your verified domain and Gmail activation, letting you know that the process was a success.\nGoogle Workspace will then log you out automatically and take you to the admin.google.com login page so that you can start managing your emails from your Google Admin Console.\nRemember that you should log in with the business email you have just set up. An \u2018@gmail.com\u2019 or personal email address will not work.\nOnce logged in to Google Admin Console, the first thing you should do is confirm if both the domain connection and Gmail activation were a success.\nTo do this, go to Domains \u00bb Manage Domains. On the right, you will see your domain listed. Check under the Status column, you should see the primary domain \u2018Verified\u2019 and \u2018Gmail Activated.\u2019\nCongratulations! You have just set up your business email using Google WorkSpace. Now, the only thing left to do is to send and receive emails.\nLuckily, it is super easy to access your business emails with Google Workspace.\nAll you have to do is log in the same way you would log in to any personal Gmail account. You will also find out that the inbox layout is similar to the personal Gmail inbox. From the layout, you can also add an email signature easily, to ensure you look more professional.\nIf you want to test if emailing is working, you can always send an email to your personal email and then send another from your personal email to your new business Google Workspace email.\nPlus, you can easily access all of Google Workspace by selecting the App Launcher icon at the top right corner of your inbox, just as you would with your personal Gmail inbox.\nYou can use Google Docs, Sheets, Slides, Meet, and more.

{"text":"Why Are We Waiting? The Logic, Urgency and Promise of Tackling Climate Change\nMIT Press, 448pp, \u00a319.95\nRecent temperatures have once again broken all records for a British July. We are now approaching the 370th month in succession that global temperatures have been above the 20th-century average. Yet, across the news channels, economists are insisting that London must expand an airport (but which one?) to sustain the inevitable growth in aviation. After 25 years of procrastination, why are we still waiting for policymakers and economists to accept the overwhelming evidence about climate change?\nLord Stern makes a strong argument for the economic and moral justification for action, just as he has done for close to a decade since he published his groundbreaking 700-page Review on the Economics of Climate Change. Stern argues repeatedly that it is an unprecedented threat and that a transition to low-carbon fuels will lead to a world that is \u201ccleaner, quieter, safer, more energy-secure, more community-based and more biodiverse\u201d. Hurrah for that.\nYet none of this is new: we have seen it in hundreds of reports, conferences and symposiums. Barack Obama, Margaret Thatcher, Robert Mugabe, Osama Bin Laden and now the Pope \u2013 surely the most improbable coalition in history \u2013 have all warned us. The most interesting question (and the promise of the book jacket) is \u201cwhy it has been so difficult to tackle climate change effectively\u201d.\nStern often seems perplexed by the question he seeks to answer. His rhetorical style is to present to us, in a neutral and noncommittal voice, a range of answers that \u201cseem wise\u201d, \u201cuseful\u201d or \u201cmay have implications\u201d. He frequently spirals into convoluted constructions such as: \u201cIf this interpretation is correct, then it would suggest that the task . . . may be more challenging than many believe.\u201d This style exemplifies all too well why many people remain unengaged with such a dry, abstract and distant-seeming policy debate. Nobody talks about terrorism in this way.\nStern adheres to the central belief that \u201csound argument should be a necessary condition for sensible and rational action\u201d. It is, he writes, \u201cthe arguments that matter\u201d. Thus, for him, the polarisation and denialism that are throttling the political process across the English-speaking world are fuelled by faulty logic: \u201csimple-minded objections\u201d, based on a \u201chandful of erroneous papers\u201d. Challenging the sceptics, he outlines four criteria which can show that \u201cbasic common sense . . . points strongly to action\u201d.\nBehind this carefully modulated language, one can sense a frustration with many people\u2019s inability to think rationally. In interviews, he is far more candid, referring to those who disagree with him as \u201cidiots\u201d and \u201cpolitically naive\u201d.\nThis is, I fear, to misunderstand the nature of climate-change denial, which is in fact highly politically astute, well-informed and strategic. Denialism is not about bad information. Nor is it irrational. It is about the defence of deeply entrenched cultural values and economic power. Nowhere in this book does Stern deal adequately with this raw identity politics, even though few people have had such a sustained opportunity to see the political sausage-making process at such close quarters.\nIt is somewhat ironic that his title \u2013 Why Are We Waiting? \u2013 echoes the chant, sung awkwardly to the tune of \u201cOh, come, all ye faithful\u201d, that accompanied so many social-rights campaigns of the 1970s. Stern makes only passing mention of the brutal political struggles of the past and ascribes the success of campaigns against slavery and apartheid to a change in \u201csocial attitudes\u201d.\nThe examples he proposes when seeking case studies of previous \u201cbig, difficult structural changes\u201d \u2013 smoking, lead in petrol and drink-driving \u2013 have little in common with climate change but much in common with his world-view. Each of them illustrates the dominant role of expert guidance, or, as Stern writes (with regard to smoking), the \u201cexpert-led, top-down, professional route to formulating policy\u201d, combined with a moral calling to social responsibility.\nAs Stern confesses in the final chapter, however, cognitive psychology shows that all of us \u2013 expert professionals included \u2013 can be highly irrational. His friend Daniel Kahneman (to whom Stern refers breezily as \u201cDanny\u201d) won a Nobel prize for showing how cognitive bias permeates high-level economic decision-making. In Kahneman\u2019s experiments, people consistently reject the arguments that seem so \u201crational\u201d to Stern; driven by their cognitive bias, they avoid short-term costs even when they are told that this may lead to far higher costs in the long term. This innate bias is then reinforced by the social norms among policymakers, false optimism and selective storytelling.\nTechnocratic cultural bias may explain Stern\u2019s greatest lacuna, a failure to recognise the central role that fossil-fuel production continues to play in corrupting the political process. Stern welcomes the removal of subsidies for fossil fuels \u2013 these distort the free market, after all \u2013 but gives no thought to a cap on their production or the $1trn per year that still pours into their expansion. Nor is he alone in this. The World Bank, his former employer, now routinely warns of catastrophic climate change while continuing to fund fossil-fuel production and carbon-based energy production \u2013 providing, by one estimate, up to $3bn per year.\nStern rightly complains that economists attempt to force everything into a cost-benefit analysis and notes, \u201cWhen someone has a hammer, every problem looks like a nail.\u201d He tries gamely to adopt other analytical tools yet there is no avoiding the reality: his life has been spent in the elite hammer culture of economic liberalism.\nSo, he brusquely discards the powerful critique of unlimited economic growth by his fellow economist Tim Jackson because it would \u201cdivert attention\u201d into an \u201cartificial race between growth and climate responsibility\u201d. His commitment to the competitive market as the spur for innovation leads him to ignore the success of the Second World War\u2019s command economies in transforming production. Surely these provide a better economic precedent for \u201cbig, difficult structural changes\u201d than drink-driving?\nThat said, his critique of mainstream economics is still valuable and pertinent. Throughout his book, Stern keeps returning to the same core theme: that conventional economics is lousy at coping with intergenerational equity, in which the affluence of one generation is obtained at the cost of the others that will follow.\nHe is scathing about conventional economic models that have \u201cgrossly underestimated\u201d the risks of future climate change. In a lengthy and often impenetrable section on discount rates (the rate at which utility declines over time), he shows that conventional theory so heavily discounts the future that it \u201ccomes close to saying, \u2018Forget about issues 100 years or more from now\u2019\u201d.\nStern finds solace in moral philosophy, drawing on Kant and Aristotle to argue the ethical grounds for action in defence of the rights of those as yet unborn. His arguments, although maintaining his air of donnish abstraction, are an important attempt to place this nebulous issue within an intellectual tradition. It is when he drops the passive voice of the technical expert and speaks of his personal concerns for the vulnerable or future generations, however (as he charmingly showed in his Ted talk, standing next to his two-week-old grand-daughter), that he becomes most persuasive. Economics is a vital tool for implementation but it is these non-negotiable emotional values that are most likely to propel us into action.\nSo, why are we waiting? Because climate change is damned hard. It challenges us at almost every level of our identity and forces us to rethink what we assume to be true. Stern is a decent man struggling, like all of us, to cope with the immensity of this change and the challenge it poses to his world-view. I\u2019m glad he is on our side.\nGeorge Marshall is a co-founder of the Climate Outreach and Information Network and the author of \u201cDon\u2019t Even Think About It: Why Our Brains Are Wired to Ignore Climate Change\u201d (Bloomsbury)","metadata":{"date":1709057835000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947474676.79\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240227153053-20240227183053-00198.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9572967291,"token_count":1764,"url":"https:\/\/www.newstatesman.com\/culture\/2015\/07\/why-are-we-still-waiting-solution-climate-change-because-it-s-hard"},"score":2,"id":"61"}

{"text":"The Ultimate Checklist for Choosing an Art Consultant\nArt is a form of expression that can be used to capture the moment and express one's creativity. It has been around for centuries and will continue to evolve as we explore new ways to create art. For those who want an expert opinion on their artwork, it is important to choose the right person for them. This checklist for choosing an art consultant will help you make your decision.\nWhat To Consider In Choosing An Art Consultant?\nGallery openings, art auctions, and artist studio tours, if you're an art lover, then these events are the highlight of your social calendar. But unless you're a professional art buyer, it can be tough to know how to evaluate and purchase art. That's where an art consultant comes in. Art consultants can help you navigate the often-confusing world of art buying, and can provide expert advice on what pieces will best suit your taste and budget. If you're thinking of hiring an art consultant, use this checklist to make sure you choose the right one for you.\nConsider what type of art consultant you need.\nThere are two main types of art consultants, those who deal in contemporary art and those who deal in traditional art. Contemporary art is that which has been created within the past few decades, while traditional art is from earlier periods in history. If you're not sure what type of artwork you like best, it might be a good idea to consult with a consultant who specializes in the type of art you're interested in. Not all consultants are experts in every area of the art world. Some may specialize in only modern or only traditional artwork, while others may have more general knowledge about a range of styles. It's important to find a consultant whose area of expertise matches your interests and\nAsk around for recommendations.\nThe best way to find a good art consultant is by asking for recommendations from people you trust. Chances are, if someone you know has had a positive experience with an art consultant, they'll be more than happy to recommend that person to you. Ask your friends and family members if they have any recommendations, or do a quick Google search for art consultants near me.\nCheck the consultant's qualifications.\nNot all art consultants are created equal. Before you hire someone, make sure to check their qualifications and experience. Many consultants have degrees in art history or a related field, while others may have years of experience working with clients in the art world. Ask the consultant about their background and what type of work they do. This will give you a better idea of whether or not they're qualified to help you with your purchase.\nRead reviews online.\nOne of the best ways to get a sense of whether or not an art consultant is right for you is to read reviews online. Look for review websites or forums where people have discussed their experiences with different art consultants. This will give you a better idea of what to expect from the consultant and whether or not they're worth working with.\nGet an estimate.\nBefore you hire an art consultant, ask for a quote on how much they will charge to help you with your purchase. Most consultants charge either hourly or by the project, depending on what type of work they do and whether it's part-time or full-time employment. Make sure that their fee makes sense given the services they're providing and is worth hiring them for. Also, make sure to read any fine print in your contract so that there aren't any hidden fees involved.\nBy Dru Bloomfield - https:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/athomeinscottsdale\/3836187025\/in\/photostream\/, CC BY 2.0, https:\/\/commons.wikimedia.org\/w\/index.php?curid=95427764\nNo matter how qualified an art consultant may seem, it's always a good idea to ask them questions about their services and what they can do for you. This will help ensure that you're both on the same page and that you're getting the most out of your consultation. Ask about the consultant's experience, what type of artwork they specialize in, and what kind of budget you should have in mind. If there are any other questions you have, don't be afraid to ask them. A good consultant will be more than happy to answer all of your questions.\nTrust your gut.\nAbove all, trust your gut when it comes to choosing an art consultant. If something about the consultant doesn't feel right, or if you're not getting good vibes from them, it's probably best to move on and find someone else. Trusting your intuition is an important part of any purchasing decision.\nChoosing an art consultant is a big decision, so it\u2019s important to be thorough in your research. We hope this checklist helped you narrow down the options and get started on finding the perfect match for both you and your home or business. If not, let us know.

{"text":"python3-pip package like this:\nsudo add-apt-repository universe\nsudo apt install python3-pip\nThere are numerous ways to install software on Ubuntu. You can install applications from the software center, from downloaded deb files, from PPAs, from Snap packages, using Flatpak, using AppImage and even from the good old source code.\nHere\u2019s another way to install packages on Ubuntu. It\u2019s called PIP and you can use it to install Python-based applications.\nWhat is pip?\nPip stands for \u201cPip Installs Packages\u201d. Pip is a command-line based package management system. It\u2019s used to install and manage software written in the Python language. You can use pip to install packages listed in the Python Package Index (PyPI).\nAs a software developer, you can use pip to install various Python modules and packages for your own Python projects.\nAs an end user, you may need pip for installing some applications that are developed using Python and can be installed easily using pip. One such example is the Stress Terminal application, which you can easily install with pip.\nLet\u2019s see how you can install pip on Ubuntu and other Ubuntu-based distributions.\nHow to install pip on Ubuntu, Linux Mint and other Ubuntu-based distributions\nFirst, make sure that Python 3 is installed on Ubuntu. To check that, use this command:\nIf it shows you a number like Python 3.x.y, Python 3 is installed on your Linux system.\nNow you can install pip3 using the command below:\nsudo apt install python3-pip\nYou should verify that pip3 has been installed correctly using this command:\nIt should show you a number like this:\npip 22.0.2 from \/usr\/lib\/python3\/dist-packages\/pip (python 3.10)\nThis means that pip3 is successfully installed on your system.\npip command defaults to pip3 in Ubuntu 20.04 and above.\nInstalling Python packages [Recommended Way]\nRecently, a change has been done on distributions like Ubuntu 23.04 and upcoming Debian 12, regarding the installation of python packages.\nFrom now on, you should install Python packages either from native repositories, install in a virtual environment or use\nThis was implemented to avoid the conflict between OS package managers and Python-specific package management tools like pip. These conflicts include both Python-level API incompatibilities and conflicts over file ownership.\nUsing pip commands\nNow that you\u2019ve installed pip, let\u2019s quickly see some basic pip commands. These commands will help you use pip commands for searching, installing and removing Python packages.\nInstall a package with pip\nThere are two ways to install a package with PIP. You either install it for the currently logged-in user, or you install system-wide.\nIf you use\n--user option, it installs the package for the logged-in user, i.e., you, without needing sudo access. The installed python software is available only for you. Other users on your system (if any) cannot use it.\npip3 install --user python_package_name\nIf you remove the\n--user option, the package will be installed system-wide, and it will be available for all the users on your system. You\u2019ll need sudo access in this case.\nsudo pip3 install python_package_name\nPIP doesn\u2019t support tab completion by default. So you need to know the exact package name that you want to install. How do you get that? I show that to you in the next section.\nSearch for packages in PyPI\nTo search for packages in the Python Package Index, you can go to their official package search website.\nFor example, if you search on \u2018stress\u2019, it will show all the packages that have the string \u2018stress\u2019 in their name or description.\nPip had provided a command line search option, which was disabled due to excessive web traffic issues. So, if you try to use\npip search package-name, you will come across an error, as shown in the screenshot below.\nSo, use the PyPI website instead, as mentioned above.\nUpgrade Packages installed via pip\nTo upgrade packages installed via pip, use the command below:\npip3 install --upgrade <package-name>\nRemove packages installed via pip\nIf you want to remove a Python package installed via pip, you can use the remove option.\npip3 uninstall <installed_package_name>\nUninstall Pip from Ubuntu\nTo remove pip from Ubuntu, open a terminal and run:\nsudo apt remove python3-pip\nsudo apt autoremove\nPipx is better! Start using it instead of Pip\nActually, if you want to use Pip for installing Python-based GUI applications, you should use Pipx. It complies with the new Python guidelines.\nUsing Pipx is similar to Pip so it should feel familiar.\nI hope you like this tutorial on installing and using Pip on Ubuntu and hopefully on other distributions, too.

The Meiji period marked a time of modernization and Westernization in Japan, as the country opened up to the world after centuries of isolation.\nMeiji prints often depicted scenes of rapid modernization, such as industrialization, urbanization, and the introduction of Western technology and fashion. The prints reflected the changing society and the fascination with Western culture that emerged during this period.\nThe subjects of Meiji prints expanded beyond traditional ukiyo-e themes.

The prints also depicted scenes from the Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895) and the Russo-Japanese War (1904-1905), reflecting Japan's military successes and nationalistic sentiments.\nIn terms of style, Meiji prints incorporated elements of Western art techniques and aesthetics. The use of perspective, shading, and realistic portrayal of figures became more prevalent. The prints also started to incorporate new materials and techniques, such as lithography and photography, alongside traditional woodblock printing.\nWhile Meiji prints were not as prolific or popular as ukiyo-e prints during the Edo period, they played a significant role in documenting and reflecting the societal changes and cultural shifts of the time.

{"text":"FarmBeats: Automating Data Aggregation\nDigital agriculture offers one of the most promising approaches to address the challenge of sustainably increasing food production by 70% by 2050 (from 2010 production levels). Using the latest advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), the farmer can be empowered with predictions that can improve farm processes, from planning until harvest.\nSatellite data and remote sensing techniques can provide agricultural insights, by using advanced image processing algorithms and AI algorithms on multiple spectral bands in satellite imagery to estimate crop health. However, satellite imagery alone is unable to capture all the data from the farms. Recent work has investigated the use of in-field sensors and imagery to complement satellite data, along with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), cameras and sensors on tractors. These data are streamed to the cloud using the latest Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, where they are processed to provide valuable insights to the farmer.\nHowever, there are two key challenges in enabling this IoT-enabled vision of data-driven farming. First is the ability to get data from the farm, as most farms have poor Internet connectivity. The second is how to make data from different modalities actionable by the farmers. The heterogeneous sensor streams need to be merged and analysed together with satellite data. In addition, data collection and analysis need to be done in a way that does not add to the farmer\u2019s workload, but instead streamline efficiency.\nThe FarmBeats solution at Microsoft uses new technologies, such as TV white spaces and Azure IoT Edge, to collect large amounts of data from the farm via sensors, tractors, cameras, drones and other devices.

{"text":"Perhaps without even realising it, you\u2019ve probably encountered radiography at some point in your life - whether that was getting an X-ray in A&E or knowing a family member who was receiving cancer treatment. While most of us are more familiar with the side that takes x-rays of bones, the field actually breaks down into two distinct disciplines: Therapeutic and Diagnostic Radiography.\nDespite diagnostic radiographers and therapeutic radiographers having very different roles, many people may not be aware of how these two important disciplines differ. In a nutshell, diagnostic radiography involves X-rays to diagnose disease and injury, such as broken bones, whilst therapeutic radiography deals with the delivery of cancer treatment.\nBelow, we go into some more detail which will hopefully give you a better understanding of these two fascinating areas of the radiography healthcare profession.\nSo, what is therapeutic radiography exactly and how does it differ from diagnostic radiography?\nTherapeutic radiography focuses on the planning and delivery of cancer treatment with radiation. Radiotherapy is one of the common ways to treat cancer, alongside surgery and chemotherapy, and involves applying targeted doses of radiation to kill cancer cells.\nThere are two main stages to a course of therapeutic radiography: planning and delivery. During the planning stage, scans are taken to determine exactly where the affected area is, create a treatment schedule before precisely calculating the dosage of radiation and where the beam will enter and exit the body.\nIn the delivery stage, a patient will attend daily radiotherapy sessions over their treatment schedule, which can often take weeks. An important part of the role is helping a patient manage any side effects and generally support them during their treatment.\nSince these courses of treatment are often a prolonged process, with patients seeing their therapeutic radiography every day for weeks at a time, therapeutic radiographers can get to know their patients quite well. Often, they become an important part of a patient\u2019s support network while they go through a very difficult time in their lives.\nThis means that developing a deep connection with your patients is an important part of the discipline and therapeutic radiography offers people the opportunity to support their patients in ways that go further than the treatments themselves.\nDiagnostic radiography, on the other hand, focuses on using specialised technology to take high quality images of the inside of the body. Working alongside doctors, these scans and X-rays are used to diagnose and monitor illnesses and injuries, ensuring a patient gets the correct treatment.\nDiagnostic radiographers work in dedicated radiography departments as well as being an important part of A&E clinics. Rather than focusing specifically on the treatment of cancer, or any one illness, diagnostic radiographers will use advanced machinery to diagnose everything from broken bones to brain bleeds.\nThe role can often be fast paced and incredibly varied. Particularly when working in an A&E clinic, it is common to see many patients over the course of a single shift. Typically, a diagnostic radiographers will only see a patient once before they are passed onto another part of the hospital for treatment, which means they will see a range of different problems in a single day, so it\u2019s a very varied and fast paced profession to work in.\nImportant distinction between these two healthcare professions\nWhere therapeutic radiographers are focused on cancer treatment and will often see the same patients on several occasions throughout their treatment period, diagnostic radiologists will constantly see different people with different injuries such as broken ankles, fractured wrists or more serious internal injuries. So, one of the very distinct differences between the roles is that a therapeutic radiographer has the opportunity to develop a supportive relationship with their cancer patients over the course of their treatment period, which could be up to several months; whereas a diagnostic radiographer is constantly dealing with many different patients with a wide range of different injuries or illnesses.\nFind out more about the undergraduate radiography courses at Queen Margaret University by visiting:","metadata":{"date":1709602111000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947476592.66\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240304232829-20240305022829-00798.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.959060967,"token_count":801,"url":"https:\/\/www.qmu.ac.uk\/campus-life\/blogs\/staff-louisa-armstrong\/the-difference-between-diagnostic-and-therapeutic-radiography\/"},"score":4,"id":"68"}
{"text":"Effects of radiation damage\non SIS performance\nT. Dotani and A. Yamashita (ISAS) and\nA. Rasmussen (MIT)\nand the SIS team\nSIS performance is gradually degrading due to the accumulated radiation damage. The effects of radiation damage are extensive: changes of energy scale, energy resolution, and detection efficiency. Details of these effects are explained together with the related calibration issues.\n1 Radiation damage\nIn the space environment, X-ray detectors are exposed to high energy particles. Particle flux is especially large in the South Atlantic Anomaly, and charged produce lattice defects in solid state detectors, such as the SIS onboard ASCA. The SIS utilizes X-ray CCDs, and lattice defects in CCDs mainly have two effects on performance: charge traps and dark current.\nLattice defects make an intermediate energy level in the forbidden band, and such an intermediate level can work as an electron trap. This means that if a charge packet encounters an empty trap during the transfer, an electron will be caught in the trap and is removed from the packet in the subsequent transfer unless it is released immediately. Thus traps lead to loss of electrons from the charge packet, and hence charge transfer efficiency (CTE) becomes lower than unity. In the case of the SIS, charge packets are typically transferred 10^3 times before read-out. Very small degradation of CTE (eg ~0.99999) will lead to significant loss of charge. Hereafter, we use charge transfer inefficiency (CTI [[equivalence]] 1-CTE) instead of CTE for convenience.\nLattice defects can also increase dark current. Even without X-ray (or optical light) irradiation some thermally excited electrons are accumulated in the pixel. This charge is called dark current. In the case of the SIS, dark current was negligibly small before launch compared to the typical size of charge packet produced by X-rays. However, dark current has been gradually increasing after launch due to accumulated radiation damage. The immediate effect of the dark current may be excess noise due to the statistical fluctuation of the dark current and hence degradation of the energy resolution. Note that dark current itself will not introduce an offset of energy scale in principle. The zero point of the energy scale is estimated onboard, but as seen later this onboard estimate is systematically low. A positive pulse-height offset is thereby introduced in the energy-pulse-height relation that turns out to be mode dependent.\nRadiation damage brings a lot of changes in SIS performance, such as change of energy scale, energy resolution and detection efficiency through these two effects. These changes are described in detail in the following sections.\n2 CTI measurements with Cas A\nBecause CTI causes systematic reduction of X-ray photon energy, we can use the reduction to measure the CTI. If we put an X-ray source having prominent and stable emission lines on several different positions on a CCD chip, the line center energies are expected to show small but systematic shifts depending on the source positions. We can estimate CTI from these systematic shifts. We selected the supernova remnant Cas A as a target for CTI calibration; it is bright and relatively compact, and has strong emission lines.\nWhen we measure CTI, we should be careful about the relation between clock\nspeed and CTI. As explained in Section 1, CTI results from the charge traps.\nEven if an electron is caught in a trap, it will not produce CTI if the\nelectron is released while the charge packet stays on the pixel. Therefore,\ntraps which easily release an electron will not contribute to CTI. At the other\nextreme, if the trap is very slow in releasing an electron, it is effectively\nkept filled and again contributes little to CTI. Thus, only the traps whose\ntime scale of releasing electron is comparable to the clock time scale is\nexpected to contribute significantly to CTI. In other words, we need to measure\nCTI for each clock of CCD.\nFigure 1Three kinds of clocks used in SIS are explained. The ST clock moves the charge packets from imaging region to frame store region, the parallel clock transfers the charge packets line by line to serial register, and the serial clock shifts the charge packets pixel by pixel in the serial register to the read-out gate.\nThe SIS uses 3 kinds of clock: ST clock, parallel clock and serial clock. The function of each clock is explained in Figure 1. These three clocks have different periods (the time between \"ticks\"). The ST clock and the pixel clock are fast, but the parallel clock is slow. The periods of each clock are listed in Table 1.\nObservations of Cas A were carried out in August 1993 and July 1994. The SIS was set in 1-CCD faint mode in both sets of observations. In the 1994 observations, there were three pointings for each chip, but the data were taken only with the standard chips in 1993. Two out of three pointings are arranged to differ only in h\/v-address. Thus we can measure the shift of line center energy due to parallel\/serial CTI separately. The CTIs determined from the line center shifts are listed in Table 2. Although it was not obvious how CTI depends on the X-ray photon energy, we found that the data are consistent with constant CTI. In other words, charge lost by CTI is proportional to the original size of the charge packet. Parallel and serial CTIs were determined from the data in 1994, but ST CTI cannot be determined from 1994 data only because the number of transfers by the ST clock is the same for all the pixels. We determined degradation of the ST CTI by comparing 1993 and 1994 data, and converted the degradation to an absolute value assuming that the CTI was zero at launch and increased linearly with time. This assumption turned out to be good because serial\/parallel CTIs determined from 1993 and 1994 observations are consistent with no CTI at launch.\n*Estimated value assuming that ST CTI increases proportionally to time after the launch.\nThe above determination of CTI assumes that CTIs are uniform over the chip. However, we suspect that there may be significant variations of CTI over the chip. Negative values of serial CTI in S1C3 may be due to this non-uniformity.\n3 Relative gain\nIn the previous section, we used only the difference of line center energies to determine the CTIs. It is a different problem whether or not line center energies become consistent between chips after CTI correction. Figure 2 shows the line center energies of Si K[[alpha]], S K[[alpha]] and Fe K[[alpha]] of Cas A obtained with 1994 data after CTI correction.\nFigure 2 Line center energies of Cas A after CTI correction. CTI values used were determined from the same observations (1994 data). Three data points in a chip correspond to three different pointings, denoted as h, v, and o. Line center energies in a chip are almost same, which means consistency between CTI determination and correction.\nIt is clear from the figure that the line center energies are different from chip to chip by at most 2%. However, we adjusted the relative gain of chips to better than 0.5% using W49B data in 1993. So, some systematic errors which we were not aware of should have been present in the gain calibration with W49B (this systematic error is explained in the next section). This motivated us to monitor the long-term history of the gain.\n4 Gain history\nNi fluorescence lines in the SIS background are effectively the only structure in the energy spectrum available to monitor long-term history of the gain. Because 1-CCD mode data were taken only with standard chips, we accumulated the Ni line data only for the standard chips. Ni line data were accumulated from all the available data until November 1994 except for those close to the bright Earth or including bright target in the FOV.\nThere is one thing we need to keep in mind when we analyze Ni line data. The Ni line is believed to originate from the kovar which covers the frame store region of the chips (see figure 2 on page 6 in ASCANews no.2). However, some part of the Ni line was suspected to originate in the exposure region. The ratio of the Ni line flux between the exposure region and the frame store region can be determined in principle by comparing the Ni line fluxes of 1-CCD and 4-CCD modes. When we compare the fluxes, we need to correct the decrease of the detection effeciency due to RDD (see Section 7). We found that the flux ratio is F^(FS)_Ni ): F^(IM)_Ni) ~ 3 : 1, where F_Ni is defined as a flux in unit area (not pixel).\nWe cannot directly correct CTI for Ni line events because the number of transfers is not known for events produced in the frame store region. However, we can estimate the average shift of Ni line energy ([[Delta]] ENi) due to CTI using the flux ratio (F(^FS)_Ni : F^(IM_Ni) ) estimated above. In what follows, CTI correction for Ni line is done by simply adding [[Delta]] ENi to the apparent center energy of the Ni line.\nFigure 3 Long-term history of Ni line energy for standard chips in 1-CCD mode (Figure 3a) and in 4-CCD mode (Figure 3b). Broken lines are apparent Ni line center energy and solid lines are that corrected for CTI and systematic energy shift in frame store region due to different pixel size. The dotted line is the expected K[[alpha]] line energy from neutral Ni (7.4723 keV).\nThe long-term history of the Ni line energy is shown in Figure 3. The Ni line energy in 1-CCD mode is almost constant after CTI correction, although there is a slight indication of annual variations. Systematic difference from the expected Ni K[[alpha]] line energy may be a calibration error. The difference of the gain between s0c1 (sensor 0, chip 1) and s1c3 (sensor 1, chip 3) is about 0.5% and is consistent with the Cas A results. On the other hand, 4-CCD mode data show clear contrast. The apparent line energy is almost constant, which means it increases after CTI correction. The difference of Ni line energies between 1 and 4-CCD modes is as large as 100 eV by the end of 1994. These results agree surprisingly well with the expected systematics stemming from zero-level errors outlined in the following section, specifically the upper panel of Figure 6. Thus, the constancy of the apparent Ni line energy (in 4-CCD mode) is very likely to be due to competing effects of CTI and the RDD. However, it is desirable to have independent measurements of CTI in 4-CCD mode (and also in 2-CCD mode), which is planned in August 1995.\nThe discrepancy between Ni line energies for 1- and 4-CCD mode may explain the calibrated gain error between chips (Figure 3): The W49B data used to calibrate gains were gathered from the various clocking modes. However, the subtle, mode- dependent systematics were not corrected for in the analysis, so it is certain that the unremoved systematics translated into small gain calibration errors.\n5 Residual dark distribution\nSIS Image data usually contain a small number of X-ray and charged particle events and most of the pixels are blank. The zero level of the energy scale, or dark level, is calculated onboard as an average pulse height of blank pixels. Only the blank pixels whose pulse height falls between -40 ADU and 40 ADU are used for this calculation. Dark level is calculated for a region of 16x16 pixels to accommodate the global variation of dark level over a chip. Onboard calculation of the dark level sometimes can not follow up the rapid change of the dark level due to the optical light leak, and this produces so-called dark frame error (DFE). DFE can be in principle corrected in the course of ground data analysis for faint mode data. The dark level of individual pixels has a statistical fluctuation around the global mean. In the ideal case, this fluctuation has a gaussian distribution and the width of the distribution corresponds to the read-out noise of the CCD.\nRadiation damage increases the dark current. This means that blank pixels tend to have higher pulse height. However, a global increase of the pulse height of the blank pixels does not affect the energy scale, because the zero level of the energy scale is determined as an average of the blank pixels. The problem is the increased scatter of dark levels among pixels. We found that the dark level distribution became wider and asymmetric with increasing radiation damage. We refer to this distribution which remains after DFE correction as residual dark distribution (RDD).\nFigure 4 Examples of the residual dark distribution (RDD) in 1-CCD and 4-CCD modes at two different epochs. Normalization of the plot reflects exposure time and source flux, and should be regarded as arbitrary. The solid line is the best-fit model function (eq. 1).\nExamples of the RDD are shown in Figure 4. These are corner pixel distributions of grade 0, 2, 3, 4 events in faint mode data after DFE correction. The corner pixels of these grades are considered to be almost free from charges produced by X-rays or charged particles. Therefore, the pulse height distribution of corner pixels is a good approximation of the RDD. RDD is wider and more asymmetric in 4-CCD mode than in 1-CCD mode. This is natural because longer exposure (16 sec for 4-CCD mode and 4 sec for 1-CCD mode) means larger dark current. Similarly, recent data show larger asymmetry than the older data. It may be worth mentioning that RDD is closely connected to flickering pixels. The high energy tail of the RDD extends beyond the event threshold (=100 ADU). This means that some pixels have large dark current which can mimic an X-ray event. Thus the flickering pixels are in fact just the high energy tail of the RDD. In this sense, pixels with large dark current are sometimes referred to as micro-flickering pixels.\nWe found that RDD can be approximated by the following model function.\nThis model function is a convolution of a d-function plus an exponential hard tail with a gaussian of width [[sigma]]. Fraction (f) represents the ratio of micro-flickering pixels, centroid (q0) is the true zero of the energy scale, and the exponential scale (Q) is a measure of the accumulated charge with RDD.\nRDD has various effects on SIS performance. We explain systematics brought by the RDD in detail in the following sections.\n6 Energy scale shift\nRDD brings two kinds of effect on the energy scale. One is a zero level offset and the other is a systematic shift of line energy through the distortion of the line profile.\nIt is easily understood that onboard calculation of the dark level suffers from systematic offset due to the asymmetry of the RDD because the onboard calculation is just a truncated mean of the pulse height of blank pixels. This offset is further modified by data reduction at ground through DFE correction. DFE correction software cross-correlates the corner pixel distribution of the data being processed and a template distribution. The template is in fact a corner pixel distribution of 1-CCD data in early 1993 and hence its distribution is almost symmetric and peaked close to zero. Thus the current DFE correction effectively aligns the distribution peak close to zero, which is always less than the truncated mean: the effective DFE \"correction\" correspondingly introduces a positive pulse height offset equal to this difference. Thus, while the on-board dark level underestimates the \"best\" zero level, the current DFE correction underestimates it by a larger measure: the offset in the gain solution is inflated as a side-effect of using FAINTDFE. Incidentally, this is no accident. The original need for FAINTDFE was to align data for which the dark level calculation was out of equilibrium. In order to align faint mode data, for example, with bright mode, with a significant equilibrium DFE, appropriate models for the cross-correllation template must be used.1 These templates are currently under development and testing for use with FAINTDFE.\nFigure 5 Line profile change due to RDD for grade 0 events. Simulated energy spectrum of SIS is shown for a model of a power law (photon index 1.7) plus a narrow line. Note that only the RDD effect related to the energy resolution is demonstrated here; degradation of the detection efficiency is not simulated.\nThe RDD also changes the line profile. The usual line profiles were originally determined by considering effects of charge generation, drift and collection, readout noise and details of the ASCA SIS event selection and pulse height recipes. Because an incident X-ray strikes a CCD pixel and thereby samples the RDD at random, the line profiles may still be predicted, provided that the readout noise distributions are replaced by the RDD everywhere. A line profile should still exhibit a low pulse height shoulder located within about a split threshold (~ 140 eV) of the peak, but as the RDD becomes broader and less symmetric, the profile grows a tail on the high pulse height side. Thus the line profile may become approximately symmetricby coincidence. We show a simulated spectrum of SIS in Figure 5 to demonstrate the RDD effect on the line profile. Note the high energy tail of the line profile and the shift of the line center. The decrease of the detection efficiency due to RDD (see Section 7) is not included in this demonstration.\nFigure 6(Upper panel) Systematic offsets of the line center energy at 6.6 keV due to the RDD are shown for various clocking modes and analysis methods. Solid, dashed, dotted lines correspond to 4-CCD, 2-CCD and 1-CCD mode data, respectively. Note that DFE correction increases systematic offsets. (Lower panel) Degradation of the energy resolution at 6.6 keV due to the RDD.\nThe current versions of SIS response matrices do not include the RDD effects. Thus, if we fit an energy spectrum affected by RDD with a model function, the line center energy suffers from a systematic shift. As mentioned above, the RDD effectively underestimates the \"best\" zero, and the first moment of the response undergoes a systematic shift in the positive pulse height direction. Figure 6 (upper panel) shows the expected systematic offset of the line center energy due to the RDD for a narrow line at 6.6 keV in various clocking modes. The amount of the shift is not very sensitive to the line energy. As seen from the figure, DFE correction increases systematic offset of the line center energy.\nFigure 6 also shows the degradation of the energy resolution due to the RDD at 6.6 keV. RDD is much broader than the distribution of the read-out noise at launch and hence degrades the energy resolution. Although FWHMs for DFE-corrected data are not shown here, we expect moderately worse resolving power for this grade combination: For a given grade, the DFE correction introduces only a shift in pulse height, so the resolution should not be affected. In the standard grade combination g0234 however, we combine single-pixel pulse height calculations with two-pixel calculations, so the pulse height shift carries along with it an additional broadening. This broadening is certainly energy dependent, because the grade branching ratios vary with energy.\n7 Detection efficiency\nRDD not only changes the energy scale\/resolution of SIS, but also changes the detection efficiency. An X-ray photon produces a charge cloud which extends at most a few pixels. The onboard processor looks for a pixel which exceeds the event threshold (=100ADU ~ 0.35 keV) and, if found, examines neighboring 8 pixels. If the pixel is a local maximum among 3x3 pixels, it is regarded as an event. Further processing may be done by the onboard processor (bright mode) or on the ground (faint mode). The surrounding 8 pixels are compared with the split threshold (=40 ADU), and the events are classified into grades according to the number and pattern of pixels which exceed the split threshold. If no pixel exceed the split threshold, the event is classified as grade 0, and higher grade is assigned to event which have larger number of pixels exceeding the split threshold. Because X-ray events usually do not extend more than 4 pixels, high grade events are regarded as non X-ray events. In the case of the SIS, grades 1, 5, 6, and 7 are regarded as non X-ray events.\nFigure 7Estimated long-term variations of the detection efficiency at 6.6 keV due to RDD. Solid, dashed, dotted lines correspond to 4-CCD, 2-CCD and 1-CCD mode data, respectively. Echo virtually adds a certain fraction of charge to the next read-out pixel, and tends to change the grade of event to higher one (filled symbols). This effect can be corrected at the ground for faint mode data (open symbols).\nThe RDD effect increases the probability of a pixel exceeding the split threshold. Lower grades of events, which are mostly X-ray events, may become higher grade of events if some of the 8 surrounding pixels exceed the split threshold. If X-ray events are changed to grades 1, 5, 6, 7, they are regarded as non X-ray events and hence removed from later processing. Thus the RDD effect alters the grade branching ratio and hence detection efficiency of the X-ray events. Figure 7 shows the long-term variations of the detection efficiency due to RDD at 6.6 keV. Reduction of the detection efficiency is most prominent in 4-CCD mode data without echo correction. In the case of 1-CCD mode data, only the reduction of detection efficiency due to the echo is seen. Increase of the echo ratio was saturated by about a year after launch.\nTo illustrate the overall effect of the RDD on the SIS broadband response, we show in Figure 8 several semi Monte Carlo spectra of 3c273 in various clocking modes. Because 1-CCD mode data are little affected by the RDD, we can get a rough idea how RDD modifies the apparent energy spectrum by comparing 1-CCD and 4-CCD results. Detection efficiency is reduced in overall energy range and the instrumental sharp structures in the spectrum (oxygen K, silicon K, and gold M edges) are smoothed out due to the degraded energy resolution. In addition, the low-energy efficiency suffers substantially as a significant fraction of the response profile falls below detection threshold. This is a direct result of the asymmetric RDD: down-shifted pulse height medians close to pulse height thresholds are stochastically rejected, which effectively smears out and inflates these thresholds. Noninflated thresholds currently stand at 120 and 160 ADU in 4-CCD mode, corresponding to 440 and 580 eV for single pixel and two-pixel events, respectively.\n8 Calibration database and analysis software\nTo cope with the degradation of SIS performance due to radiation damage, updates of calibration database and analysis software are now in progress.\nBecause the relative gain between chips was calibrated using all 1\/2\/4-CCD mode data of W49B, which are now known to have different CTI\/RDD effects, it includes relatively large systematic error. As explained so far, we have calibrated the gain with Ni line in the background and Cas A observations. The new gain will be released after consistency check with the previous calibration.\nFigure 8 Simulated spectra of 3c273 (in December 1993) in various clocking modes at two different epochs. Left panel shows the spectra expected at 2 years after the launch, and right panel those of 4 years after the launch. These histograms are of actual flight faint mode (3 x 3) data. Expected RDD effects were introduced by Monte Carlo corruption of all pixels, such that the corner pixel distributions are consistent with current, best projections (by Yamashita and Dotani) of the RDD evolution. Naturally, this includes the RDD-driven, self-consistent onboard zero level error. Onboard processing of this data was also simulated to produce these histograms.\nThe current program of DFE correction introduces a systematic offset in the energy scale when applied to the data with RDD. We need to use an appropriate template depending on the clocking modes and time after the launch. Because the template is in fact RDD itself, we can use the model function in equation 1. We have found analytic formulae which can describe the long-term variations of the parameters in equation 1 for 1\/2\/4-CCD modes. The new DFE correction program will use the model function, which is determined by the clocking mode and observation time, as a template.\nCTI in 1-CCD mode was measured with Cas A data. But, as explained in Section 4, CTI may depend on the clocking mode of CCD. Because we do not have appropriate data to determine the CTI in 2\/4-CCD modes, we are planning to observe Cas A once again in August in 1995. CTI in 2\/4-CCD modes will be determined with these new data.\nBecause RDD effects are not easy to correct at ground data processing, the effects should be included in the response matrices. This means that SIS matrices would become clocking mode and time dependent. The effort of upgrading the response builder is continuing.\nWe have made substantial progress in understanding the effects of radiation damage on SIS performance. As has been shown in sections 6 and 7, the RDD has degraded 4-CCD mode data so as to make this mode unusable; 2-CCD mode may also become unusable in the foreseeable future. Unfortunately, this severely limits the scope for future observations of extended sources with the SIS. However, 1-CCD mode continues to function well and, therefore, point source observations are affected little. We will be issuing updated calibration software and data, notably a new response builder that generates time and mode dependent matrices, to enable more accurate analyses of the existing SIS data.\nSee ftp:\/\/benz.mit.edu\/asuka\/sis\/rdd\/RDD_memo_6_16_94.ps for details regarding these models and a thorough analytical formulation of the RDD.\nProceed to the next article Return to the previous article","metadata":{"date":1708853066000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947474594.56\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240225071740-20240225101740-00498.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9240626097,"token_count":5609,"url":"https:\/\/heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov\/docs\/asca\/newsletters\/rad_dam_sis3.html"},"score":4,"id":"69"}

{"text":"|The Thursday Friends are a group of quilters who get together regularly to learn new techniques and to share ideas and projects. The group serves as volunteer coordinators for the annual fall quilt show at Olbrich Gardens in Madison and has made some of the large quilts which Olbrich raffles every year. Rosemary Schmidt, former MATC instructor, serves as facilitator of the informal group. Members are also part of the larger quilt guild of Madison, \"Mad City Quilters.\" For this exhibit the Friends are pleased to add Rumi O'Brien's special story quilt to those done by members of the group.\n|Quilts have been made for many hundreds\nof years. In this country the quilting tradition really took off\nin the nineteenth century as pioneer women sought interesting ways to use\nup fabric scraps while keeping their families warm. Over the years\nquilting evolved into a highly personal folk art form entailing craft\nas well as creativity, and exhibiting a wide range of traditional and innovative\nQuilts are composed of three layers: a top, a backing, and some kind of batting or filling. They are often described as a textile sandwich, and the quilting is actually the stitching that holds the three layers together and prevents the filling from shifting. Pieced quilts are quilts whose tops are made from the stitching together of many individual pieces of fabric. Applique quilts are made with a foundation fabric onto which many individual pieces are sewn. Quilts today can be HAND PIECED, MACHINE PIECED, HAND APPLIQUED, MACHINE APPLIQUED, and HAND QUILTED or MACHINE QUILTED. You will see examples and combinations of each in this exhibit.\n|Quilting today involves more than just creating coverings for beds. Many traditional and contemporary designs are being made on a smaller scale as wall hangings, draperies, tablecloths, and clothing. The pieces on display here reflect this range, and demonstrate a wide variety of techniques. Rumi O'Brien's story quilt is an example of a large wall hanging completely hand appliqued and hand quilted.\n|Ginny Riker's kaleidoscope is a bed-sized\nquilt which is machine pieced and machine quilted. The exhibit includes\ntraditional patterns such as Wedding Ring, Mariner's Compass, Trip Around\nthe World, and Stars, as well as more modern techniques such as Stained\nGlass, Bargello (tapestry-like), Watercolor (Monet inspired\nusing small blended flower fabrics), and Three-dimensional Applique with\nfolded fabric and embellishments.\nThe exhibit also includes a style of quilting called the landscape quilt. With this modern technique the quilter essentially paints a picture with fabric and uses extensive machine quilting to help achieve depth and definition. Donna Willadsen's landscape demonstrates these techniques using some of the many fabrics now on the market designed especially for quilters.\n|Although many simple and utilitarian quilts\nare still made today, most contemporary quilts can be considered\nhighly sophisticated art forms. The ability to design and to manipulate\ncolor, harmony, scale, pattern, and texture are skills inherent in the\nquilt artist. There are many quilt shows each year in the Madison\narea and in southern part of Wisconsin that showcase the talents of both\nmen and women quilters.\nThis exhibit was put together by the Thursday Friends.

{"text":"Peter Fabulian was a doctor of osteopathy who practiced in Kennett Square, Pennsylvania. As is typical for those considered \u201cLyme literate\u201d, Fabulian had no recognized advanced credentials in infectious disease. A 2010 Police Criminal Complaint alleged that Fabulian touched several female patients in a suggestive or sexual manner during medical examinations without consent.\nIn December 2010, Fabulian pled guilty to two counts of indecent assault. He was sentenced to 1-23 months imprisonment followed by five months electronic home confinement, and probation for two years.\nThe Pennsylvania Board of Osteopathic Medicine indefinitely suspended Fabulian\u2019s license to practice medicine for no less than five years. The Board also discovered that Fabulian \u201cactively practiced medicine for about six years without malpractice insurance.\u201d\nAccording to an Order Continuing Suspension by the Board, prior to pleading guilty, Fabulian \u201cdenied any improper sexual misconduct with Patients #1 and #2\u201d and \u201cpresented a packet of patient testimonials as to the efficacy of his practice.\u201d\nAs reported in a 2006 article, Fabulian claimed to have treated Lyme patients for 6 years. He was quoted as saying, \u201cI see at least 200 Lyme patients a month here, probably 15 new patients a week.\u201d\nThis is an absurd number of Lyme patients for one family doctor to be treating, even in a state like Pennsylvania with many real cases of Lyme disease. Remember, real Lyme disease is curable with a short course of generic antibiotics.\nThe Board Order alleged of Fabulian (\u201cRespondent\u201d):\n- According to the police criminal complaint, a female patient (Patient #1) reported to the Kennett Square Police Department that during an appointment she had with Respondent in October 2008, Respondent grabbed the collar of her blouse and looked down at her breasts, and that Patient #1 pushed his hands away from her body.\n- Patient #1 reported that Respondent hugged her and kissed her on the neck, that Respondent kissed her approximately ten times, that Respondent licked her neck, and that Respondent told her, \u201cYou taste so good.\u201d\n- According to the police criminal complaint, a female patient (Patient #2) reported to the Kennett Square Police Department that during an appointment she had with Respondent in May 2010, Respondent hugged her tightly during the examination and kissed her on the lips, telling her he wanted to take in her scent, and that Patient #2 pulled away from Respondent.\n- Patient #2 reported that Respondent kissed her on her neck and grabbed her right hand and placed it on his groin area, and that Patient #2 could feel his erection.\nThe Inquirer described Fabulian\u2019s sentencing as follows:\nAssistant District Attorney Andrea Cardamone, who sought a six-month jail term, said that after Fabulian was charged with assaulting two women, others came forward. She said that two were within the statute of limitations and that the District Attorney\u2019s Office agreed not to file additional charges in exchange for Fabulian\u2019s cooperation.\nShe said the agreement also included a provision that the court would hear about the other two cases to show a pattern.\nDuring a hearing that lasted nearly three hours, Cardamone presented two witnesses and read a letter from a third. The women are not being identified by The Inquirer because of the nature of the offenses.\nBoth described Fabulian\u2019s sexual overtures as an excruciating breach of trust. The first woman said she had to wait a year and a half for charges to be filed after contacting police because authorities said another victim would bolster her case.\nThe Delaware County Daily Times reported:\nSpeaking to Judge David Bortner before he imposed sentence, the victims said the assaults left them severely traumatized.\n\u201cWhat he did to me will affect me for years to come,\u201d said a patient who Dr. Peter Fabulian groped after she came to him for treatment. \u201cHe has taken away the sacred trust that a patient has with a physician.\u201d\n\u201cI felt dirty, foolish and embarrassed for something I didn\u2019t do,\u201d another woman wrote to Bortner. She said she still feels nauseous when she thinks of his smile as he began fondling her. \u201cHis behavior was purposeful, calculated and chronic.\u201d\nThe Delaware County Daily Times: Kennett Square doc gets jail for fondling patients\nThe Southern Chester County Weeklies: Kennett Square doctor loses license for sexual assault\nThe Philadelphia Inquirer: Doctor sentenced in indecent assaults on patients\nLancasterOnline: Strasburg doc to prison\nThe Philadelphia Inquirer: Lyme disease underreported, experts say\nPennsylvania State Board of Osteopathic Medicine: Peter Fabulian Final Order\nPennsylvania State Board of Osteopathic Medicine: Peter Fabulian Memorandum Order Continuing Temporary Suspension\nNew Jersey State Board of Medical Examiners: Peter Fabulian Final Order of Discipline\nUnited States Bankruptcy Court: Opinion about one of Fabulian\u2019s patients","metadata":{"date":1709471226000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947476374.40\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240303111005-20240303141005-00699.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9670795202,"token_count":1075,"url":"https:\/\/lymescience.org\/peter-fabulian-lyme-literate-doctor-llmd\/"},"score":1,"id":"80"}
{"text":"Recent events in the House of Commons have reignited discussions about the power of public figures to shape public discourse and inclusivity. While avoiding politicisation remains crucial, open and respectful dialogue about the impact of words and actions on diverse communities is essential.\nBeyond \u201cUs vs. Them\u201d:\nIt\u2019s vital to acknowledge that humans are intricate beings with multifaceted identities shaped by experiences, beliefs, and characteristics far beyond singular aspects like gender or biology. Reducing someone to a single aspect fuels harmful stereotypes and hinders understanding.\nAcceptance as a Bridge:\nAcceptance doesn\u2019t equate to agreeing with everything someone says or does. It signifies creating safe spaces for genuine dialogue and understanding, even amidst differing perspectives. Advocating for \u201cacceptance without understanding\u2122\u201d resonates deeply as it fosters empathy and opens doors to genuine curiosity and learning. This approach recognises the intrinsic value of every individual, regardless of their background or identity.\nEcho Chambers and the Power of Perception:\nEcho chambers, where individuals primarily encounter information reinforcing their existing beliefs, threaten understanding and inclusivity. When public figures, wielding influence and authority, use language that excludes or disrespects certain groups, they inadvertently solidify these echo chambers and amplify existing biases. This can significantly impact public perception and understanding, potentially hindering meaningful dialogue and amplifying divisions.\nThe Anchoring Effect and Confirmation Bias:\nOur initial impressions, influenced by \u201canchoring bias,\u201d can shape how we perceive subsequent information. Public figures\u2019 actions and statements can set an \u201canchor\u201d for how specific topics are perceived, potentially skewing public interpretation.\nAdditionally, \u201cconfirmation bias,\u201d the tendency to seek out information confirming existing beliefs, can further create echo chambers, limiting exposure to diverse perspectives. This highlights the importance of public figures fostering open and respectful dialogue, promoting understanding, and challenging harmful stereotypes and misinformation.\nBuilding Bridges with Data:\nStatistics paint a powerful picture of public opinion on LGBTQ+ rights and acceptance. Consider these:\n73% of Britons believe same-sex couples deserve equal marriage rights (YouGov poll).\n82% of Britons believe transgender individuals should have the right to live according to their chosen gender identity (Stonewall Report).\nThese figures indicate an apparent disconnect between public opinion and certain narratives amplified within echo chambers. Public figures engaging in behaviour aligning with those narratives can further widen this gap and hinder meaningful dialogue and understanding.\nMoving Forward: A Shared Journey:\nBuilding a more inclusive and compassionate society necessitates fostering respectful dialogue and understanding across diverse groups. Public figures play a crucial role by being mindful of the impact their words and actions can have. They can actively promote understanding by:\nEngaging in open and respectful dialogue: This entails listening actively, seeking diverse perspectives, and promoting civil discourse.\nChallenging harmful stereotypes and misinformation: Combating biases and amplifying accurate information fosters a more inclusive and informed society.\nCreating platforms for diverse voices to be heard: Inclusivity thrives when individuals from various backgrounds and perspectives actively shape public discourse.\nWith over 25 years of dedicated leadership in the corporate, feminist, and LGBTQ+ realms, with a profound commitment to LGBTQ+ and women\u2019s rights, I\u2019m thrilled to be recognised by the British Diversity Awards. I stand ready to support, consult, educate, and advise on your next diversity challenge. Your journey towards inclusivity begins with a conversation.

{"text":"Physical library spaces are designed to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), hence the wide aisles, low checkout stations, and ramps. In contrast, alt tag awareness is low and web accessibility not a priority for most librarians. Yet for visually or otherwise impaired users, an improperly coded website can be like wandering into a maze and hitting a brick wall of frustration.\nWith accessibility in mind, I\u2019ve been teaching myself to assess and retrofit webpages, aligning my library\u2019s website with the W3C\u2019s Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), the U.S. Rehabilitation Act\u2019s Section 508, and this WebAIM Infographic aimed at accessible design as well as code. For best practices, these are your first stops.\nDesign for Users\nCrucially, designing with accessibility in mind makes for websites that are more usable for everyone, not just for disabled users. Questioning trendy design elements can pay off too. Do image-heavy carousels and page-spanning images really enhance UX enough to justify the space they fill and the accessibility problems they may engender?\nOut-of-the-box products may come with their own access problems. WordPress themes often provide low contrast. LibGuides omits the HTML lang attribute on some templates. Developers forget alt tags and form labels. Sometimes it\u2019s easier just to fix stuff yourself.\nAnd I use the word \u201ceasier\u201d advisedly. \ud83d\ude42\nW3C Markup Validator\nFirst, copy and paste your webpage\u2019s URL into the free W3C Markup Validation Service to check the HTML for conformance to W3C web standards. Optimally, your code would be up to HTML5 (and CSS3) standards. This makes for cleaner aesthetics, no deprecated elements, and fewer errors when you run accessibility evaluation tools in the next stages of this process. The Validator will tell you which lines of code need correcting, and lead you to relevant documentation. Once your code is sound (imperfections are ok), break out the WAVE tool.\nPlug in a URL, and the WAVE web accessibility evaluation tool from WebAIM will scan your code, flagging errors, marking structural elements, and alerting you to potential issues. WAVE will flag link texts that say \u201cClick here\u201d or \u201cMore,\u201d redundant or empty links, PDFs that may or may not be optimized for accessibility, missing alternative text and form elements, and other problems. WAVE also says what the page does right (for example, WAI-ARIA features, helpful alternative text, and the like).\nBrowser Developer Tools\nTo dig deeper into your code, I suggest using a browser developer tool (Bryan Brown wrote an excellent LITA Blog post on such tools). Google Chrome\u2019s Accessibility Developer Tools are particularly good at auditing for color contrast and recognizable links. Add these to your browser and you can test any page for accessibility and discover exactly what could be improved. Note that these tools can be really nitpicky, and again, functionality rather than perfection is our goal.\nCan you turn off the CSS and still make sense of the page design? Did nothing disappear? Can you manually resize the font to at least 150% without spectacularly messing up the design? Can you navigate using only the keyboard? Are any videos close captioned and any audio files accompanied by transcripts? Can you run pages or sections of pages through a screen reader and still make sense of the content? Try it, and congratulations! You just became a web accessibility guru.\nYou\u2019re not a web developer, you say? Neither am I. But even if your job has nothing to do with digital services, librarians need to know about these technical matters so as to make the case for prioritizing web accessibility and to be able to speak the language of colleagues (often the IT department) who do engage in web development. Web accessibility builds equal access and diverse communities. These are enduring values for librarians, and why I joined the profession.\nWhat about you?

{"text":"Serotonin syndrome, also called serotonin toxicity, is a potentially serious reaction usually caused by medications that increase serotonin. Too much serotonin can negatively affect the brain, muscles, and other parts of the body.\nWhat is serotonin syndrome?\nSerotonin syndrome, also called serotonin toxicity, is a potentially serious drug reaction. It\u2019s believed to occur when too much serotonin builds up in your body. Nerve cells produce serotonin.\nSerotonin is a neurotransmitter, which is a chemical that helps regulate:\n- blood flow\n- body temperature\nIt also plays an important role in the functioning of nerve and brain cells and may impact mood.\nIf you take different prescribed medications together, you may end up with too much serotonin in your body. The types of medication that could lead to serotonin syndrome include those used to treat depression and migraine, and manage pain.\nToo much serotonin can cause a variety of mild to severe symptoms. These symptoms can affect the brain, muscles, and other parts of the body.\nSerotonin syndrome can occur if you take too much medication that boosts serotonin levels.\nIt could happen if:\n- you start a new medication that interferes with serotonin\n- your doctor increases the dosage of a medication you\u2019re already taking\n- you combine two substances that lead to increased serotonin levels, whether medications, supplements, or illegal drugs\nThe condition is most likely to occur when two or more drugs are taken together.\nSerotonin syndrome can be fatal if you do not receive prompt treatment.\nYou may have symptoms within minutes or hours of starting a new medication or having the dosage of an existing medication increased. The symptoms may include:\n- a rapid heart rate\n- muscle rigidity\n- dilated pupils\n- twitching, jerking or muscle spasms\n- a dry mouth and throat\n- flushed skin\n- increased bowel sounds or diarrhea\n- roving eye movements\n- a stretching upward of both big toes on stimulation, known as Babinski sign\nIn more severe cases, symptoms may include:\n- loss of consciousness\nIn severe cases, it can be life threatening.\nSymptoms tend to appear quickly after exposure to a drug. Most people who experience toxicity will develop symptoms within\nFor this reason, it is essential to seek help immediately if anyone shows symptoms that could indicate serotonin syndrome.\nSerotonin syndrome results from the use of drugs, supplements, and other substances.\nIt can happen if you:\n- accidentally use medications that are not suitable or at a dosage that is too high\n- combine two drugs that boost serotonin\n- intentionally take too much of a drug\nTypically, the condition occurs when you combine two or more medications, illegal drugs, or nutritional supplements that increase serotonin levels.\nFor example, you might take medication to help with a migraine after already taking an antidepressant. Some prescription medications, such as opioid pain relievers, may also increase serotonin levels, according to a\nOther examples of drugs and supplements associated with serotonin syndrome include:\nAntidepressants associated with serotonin syndrome include:\n- selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), such as Celexa and Zoloft\n- serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), such as Effexor\n- tricyclic antidepressants, such as nortriptyline and amitriptyline\n- monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), such as Nardil and Marplan\nMigraine medications (triptan category)\nExamples of triptans include:\n- almotriptan (Axert)\n- naratriptan (Amerge)\n- sumatriptan (Imitrex)\nCertain illegal drugs are associated with serotonin syndrome.

Your doctor may begin by reviewing your medical history and symptoms.\nThey will consider:\n- physical symptoms\n- any medication you\u2019re taking\n- any other substances that may contribute to the condition, such as supplements\nBe sure to tell your doctor if you\u2019re taking any medications or have used recreational drugs or supplements in recent weeks. This information can help your doctor make a more accurate diagnosis.\nYour doctor will usually perform several other tests. These will help your doctor find out if certain organs or body functions have been affected. They can also help your doctor rule out other conditions.\nTests your doctor may order include:\n- a complete blood count (CBC)\n- a blood culture\n- thyroid function tests\n- drug screens\n- kidney function tests\n- liver function tests\nSome conditions have similar symptoms to serotonin syndrome. These include:\n- drug overdose\n- hormonal problems\nA condition known as neuroleptic malignant syndrome also has similar symptoms. It\u2019s an adverse reaction to medications used to treat some mental health conditions.\nIf you have a very mild case of serotonin syndrome, your doctor may only advise you to immediately stop taking the medication causing the problem.\nIf you have severe symptoms, you\u2019ll need to go to the hospital. At the hospital, your doctor will closely monitor your condition. You might also receive the following treatments:\n- withdrawal of any medication that caused the condition\n- intravenous fluids for dehydration and fever\n- medications that help relieve muscle stiffness or agitation\n- medications that block serotonin\nIn severe cases, a doctor may recommend using cyproheptadine, which is an antidote.\nIn severe cases, serotonin syndrome\n- rhabdomylosis, in which muscle tissue breaks down, releasing myoglobin, a substance that can damage the kidneys\n- metabolic acidosis\n- kidney failure\n- respiratory failure\n- acute respiratory distress syndrome\n- blood clots\nIn some cases, it can be fatal. If this happens, it is usually within\nThe outlook for serotonin syndrome is good if a person receives a prompt diagnosis and treatment. A person who has no symptoms 6 to 8 hours after exposure is unlikely to experience severe poisoning.\nMost people recover fully and have no further problems once serotonin levels return to normal.\nWhen a fatality occurs, the situation is more likely to have happened with MAOI use than with an SSRI. SSRIs alone are unlikely to cause death, but they can do so if they\u2019re taken alongside another drug or substance.\nYou cannot always prevent serotonin syndrome. Make sure your doctor knows what medications you\u2019re taking. Your doctor should closely monitor you if you\u2019re taking a combination of medications known to increase serotonin levels. This is especially important right after you start a new medication or right after your doctor increases your dosage.\nThe FDA requires warning labels on products to warn people of the risk of serotonin syndrome.\nSerotonin syndrome is a type of poisoning that can occur if a person takes too much of a medication that boosts serotonin levels or if they combine two such drugs. Examples include antidepressant medication, various illegal drugs, and some supplements.\nThe symptoms usually appear quickly. In some cases, they can be life threatening. They include restlessness, twitching, changes in heart rhythm, and so on.\nIf anyone develops symptoms after using drugs that boost serotonin, they or someone else should seek immediate medical help.\nWith prompt treatment, most people make a full recovery.","metadata":{"date":1708587324000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947473735.7\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240222061937-20240222091937-00298.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9126053452,"token_count":1575,"url":"https:\/\/www.healthline.com\/health\/serotonin-syndrome?utm_source=ReadNext"},"score":4,"id":"84"}

{"text":"- Understanding Cloud Migration\n- Understanding Cloud Infrastructure Migration\n- Executing the Migration\n- Challenges and Considerations in Cloud Infrastructure Migration\nCloud migration is a process that involves moving digital business operations into the cloud. This process can be complex and multifaceted, involving various strategies, tools, and considerations. This glossary entry aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of cloud migration, specifically focusing on cloud infrastructure migration.\nCloud infrastructure migration is a subset of cloud migration that specifically deals with moving an organization\u2019s physical or virtual servers to a cloud environment. This process can involve various steps and considerations, including assessing the current infrastructure, planning the migration, executing the migration, and monitoring the new environment.\nUnderstanding Cloud Migration #\nBefore delving into the specifics of cloud infrastructure migration, it\u2019s important to understand the broader concept of cloud migration. Cloud migration is the process of moving data, applications, and other business elements from an organization\u2019s onsite computers to the cloud, or moving them from one cloud environment to another.\nCloud migration is often a strategic move made by organizations to take advantage of the benefits offered by cloud computing. These benefits can include cost savings, increased flexibility, improved collaboration, and access to advanced technologies and services.\nTypes of Cloud Migration #\nThere are several types of cloud migration that an organization might choose to undertake. The choice of migration type will depend on the organization\u2019s specific needs and circumstances. The three main types of cloud migration are public, private, and hybrid.\nPublic cloud migration involves moving data and applications to a cloud environment that is owned and managed by a third-party cloud service provider. Private cloud migration, on the other hand, involves moving data and applications to a cloud environment that is owned and managed by the organization itself. Hybrid cloud migration involves a combination of both, with some data and applications remaining on-premise or in a private cloud, and others being moved to a public cloud.\nCloud Migration Strategies #\nThere are several strategies that an organization might use when undertaking a cloud migration. These strategies, often referred to as the \u201c5 R\u2019s\u201d, include rehosting, replatforming, refactoring, repurchasing, and retiring. Each strategy has its own benefits and considerations, and the choice of strategy will depend on the organization\u2019s specific needs and circumstances.\nRehosting, also known as \u201clift-and-shift\u201d, involves moving applications and data to the cloud without making any changes. Replatforming involves making some changes to optimize for the cloud, but not changing the core architecture of the application. Refactoring involves re-architecting an application to take full advantage of cloud-native features. Repurchasing involves moving to a different product that\u2019s already cloud-based. Retiring involves getting rid of applications or data that are no longer needed.\nUnderstanding Cloud Infrastructure Migration #\nCloud infrastructure migration is a specific type of cloud migration that involves moving an organization\u2019s physical or virtual servers to a cloud environment. This process can involve various steps and considerations, including assessing the current infrastructure, planning the migration, executing the migration, and monitoring the new environment.\nCloud infrastructure migration can offer several benefits, including cost savings, increased flexibility, and access to advanced technologies and services. However, it can also be a complex and challenging process that requires careful planning and execution.\nAssessing the Current Infrastructure #\nThe first step in a cloud infrastructure migration is to assess the current infrastructure. This involves understanding what servers and applications the organization currently has, how they are used, and what dependencies exist between them. This information is crucial for planning the migration and ensuring that the new environment will meet the organization\u2019s needs.\nAssessing the current infrastructure also involves understanding the organization\u2019s business requirements and objectives. This includes understanding what the organization hopes to achieve through the migration, such as cost savings, increased flexibility, or access to new technologies and services. This information will help guide the migration strategy and decision-making process.\nPlanning the Migration #\nOnce the current infrastructure has been assessed, the next step is to plan the migration. This involves deciding on a migration strategy, choosing a cloud service provider, and designing the new environment. The migration plan should also include a timeline for the migration, a budget, and a plan for managing risks and issues that may arise during the migration.\nPlanning the migration also involves preparing the organization for the change. This can involve training staff, communicating the plan to stakeholders, and setting expectations for the migration process and outcomes. It\u2019s important to ensure that everyone involved understands the plan and is prepared for the migration.\nExecuting the Migration #\nOnce the migration has been planned, the next step is to execute the migration. This involves moving the servers and applications to the new cloud environment, according to the migration plan. This process can be complex and time-consuming, and it\u2019s important to have a clear plan and process in place to manage the migration.\nExecuting the migration also involves testing the new environment to ensure that everything is working as expected. This can involve running tests to check that applications are functioning correctly, that data has been transferred correctly, and that performance is meeting expectations. Any issues that are identified during testing should be addressed before the new environment is put into production.\nMonitoring the New Environment #\nOnce the migration has been executed and the new environment is in production, the final step is to monitor the new environment. This involves keeping an eye on performance, managing any issues that arise, and continually optimizing the environment to meet the organization\u2019s needs.\nMonitoring the new environment also involves measuring the outcomes of the migration. This can involve tracking metrics related to cost savings, performance improvements, and other benefits that the organization hoped to achieve through the migration. This information can be used to evaluate the success of the migration and to inform future migration efforts.\nChallenges and Considerations in Cloud Infrastructure Migration #\nWhile cloud infrastructure migration can offer many benefits, it can also be a complex and challenging process. There are many factors that need to be considered and managed during the migration, including technical challenges, business considerations, and human factors.\nTechnical challenges can include issues related to data transfer, application compatibility, and performance. Business considerations can include issues related to cost, risk, and business continuity. Human factors can include issues related to change management, training, and communication.\nManaging Risks and Issues #\nOne of the key challenges in cloud infrastructure migration is managing risks and issues that arise during the migration. This can involve technical issues, such as data loss or downtime, as well as business issues, such as cost overruns or delays. It\u2019s important to have a clear plan and process in place for managing these risks and issues, to ensure that the migration is successful and that the organization\u2019s business operations are not disrupted.\nManaging risks and issues also involves having a clear understanding of the organization\u2019s risk tolerance and business objectives. This can help guide decision-making during the migration and ensure that risks and issues are managed in a way that aligns with the organization\u2019s goals and priorities.\nEnsuring Business Continuity #\nAnother key consideration in cloud infrastructure migration is ensuring business continuity. This involves ensuring that the organization\u2019s business operations can continue uninterrupted during the migration. This can involve planning for downtime, ensuring that data is backed up and can be recovered if necessary, and having a contingency plan in place in case of unexpected issues.\nEnsuring business continuity also involves communicating with stakeholders, including staff, customers, and partners, about the migration and any potential impacts on business operations. This can help manage expectations and ensure that everyone is prepared for the migration.\nCloud infrastructure migration is a complex process that involves moving an organization\u2019s physical or virtual servers to a cloud environment. This process can offer many benefits, including cost savings, increased flexibility, and access to advanced technologies and services. However, it also involves many challenges and considerations, including technical challenges, business considerations, and human factors.\nDespite these challenges, with careful planning, execution, and monitoring, cloud infrastructure migration can be a successful and beneficial process for many organizations. By understanding the concepts and considerations outlined in this glossary entry, organizations can be better prepared to undertake a cloud infrastructure migration and to reap the benefits of cloud computing.","metadata":{"date":1708659412000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947474360.86\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240223021632-20240223051632-00897.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.946714282,"token_count":1721,"url":"https:\/\/spicule.co.uk\/docs\/cloud-migration-cloud-infrastructure-migration-explained\/"},"score":3,"id":"86"}
{"text":"A fundamental topic of discussion has arisen: the connection between green innovations and economic growth in light of the urgent need for sustainable development and the mounting global environmental issues. In this discussion, we look at how green ideas can help the economy thrive while reducing our impact on the environment. Sustainable solutions are becoming more and more important as the world faces the consequences of climate change and resource loss. The paper explores the interdependent nature of green technologies and economic growth, illuminating how adopting sustainable practices might lead to future resilience and prosperity.\nEnvironmentally Conscious Innovations:\nConcern over the effects of unbridled industrialization and consumerism on the environment has reached critical mass in the twenty-first century. In light of this realization, environmentally friendly innovations have arisen as a symbol of optimism. The goal of these breakthroughs is to lessen the impact that human activities have on the environment. They range from renewable energy technology to environmentally friendly production techniques. Green technologies are crucial because they may promote economic growth while also addressing pressing challenges like pollution, climate change, and biodiversity loss.\nEnvironmentally Friendly Advancements and the Generation of New Jobs:\nA lot of people think that becoming green will slow down the economy, but in reality, green advancements have actually helped to create more jobs. Competent labor is essential for creating, deploying, and maintaining environmentally friendly technology as we move toward a green economy. Possibilities for employment in renewable energy, waste management, and sustainable agriculture are expanding as a result of industry-wide shifts toward more environmentally friendly practices. Developing a trained and versatile workforce is just one of the many benefits of green technology, which also generate job opportunities.\nRenewable Energy Technology Advancements:\nImproved methods of producing energy from renewable sources are a bedrock of environmentally friendly developments. Both environmental degradation and economic susceptibility to oil price swings can be traced back to conventional wisdom\u2019s reliance on fossil fuels. Reducing carbon emissions and improving energy security are two benefits of shifting to renewable energy sources like solar, wind, and hydropower. By putting money into renewable energy infrastructure, countries may help achieve global sustainability goals and get a head start in the growing green economy.\nSustainable Production and the Circular Economy:\nA circular economy is becoming more popular as a means to an end in the fight for long-term sustainability. By reusing, recycling, and regenerating resources, a circular economy aims to minimize waste, in contrast to the linear \u201ctake-make-dispose\u201d paradigm. In order to maximize efficiency while decreasing environmental effect, green innovations in sustainable manufacturing processes use this circular strategy. In addition to helping the environment, businesses that embrace the circular economy principles strengthen the economy by making resources more resistant to disruption, which bodes well for the future.\nSustainable Urbanization and Smart Cities:\nThere are possibilities and threats to sustainable development brought about by the fast rate of urbanization. Smart cities, which use technology to increase efficiency, decrease energy consumption, and improve people\u2019s quality of life, rely heavily on green advancements. By utilizing intelligent transportation systems and energy-efficient buildings, smart cities are able to create economically thriving and environmentally sustainable urban environments. A more balanced relationship between cities and their natural surroundings can be achieved through the use of green technology in city planning.\nSustainable Investment and Finance:\nIt will be necessary to spend heavily in environmentally friendly technologies and practices in order to make the shift to a sustainable future. A significant enabler of green technologies, green finance entails directing funding towards projects that are environmentally friendly. Aligning financial resources with sustainability goals is becoming more important for governments, corporations, and financial institutions. The financial industry is vital in channeling funds towards projects that foster economic development and environmental preservation, through green bonds and sustainable investment portfolios.\nPossibilities and Obstacles:\nThe road to a sustainable future is not without its obstacles, but the advantages of environmentally friendly advancements are enormous. The necessity for worldwide cooperation, policy vacuums, and technology obstacles all fall under this category of difficulties. Nevertheless, there is a chance for creativity, teamwork, and preparation for the future in every obstacle. Societies may realize the full promise of green innovations if they overcome these obstacles, and in the future, sustainable economic growth will be associated with environmental sustainability.\nThe union of environmentally friendly advances with economic growth is a ray of hope in the quest for a sustainable future. Environmental preservation and economic growth are no longer seen as mutually exclusive due to the interconnectedness of these two ideas. At this juncture in history, decisions taken now will have far-reaching consequences for decades to come. A robust and thriving global economy can be fostered through the adoption of green innovations, which also help to reduce the effects of climate change. If we want to live in peace with the Earth, we must adopt sustainable methods; doing otherwise is not even a choice.","metadata":{"date":1709222882000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947474843.87\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240229134901-20240229164901-00598.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9258687496,"token_count":987,"url":"http:\/\/luhla.com\/2023\/12\/14\/green-innovations-and-economic-growth-a-sustainable-future\/"},"score":3,"id":"87"}

{"text":"The Salt Lake City area frequently sees summer tropospheric ozone (O3) concentrations that exceed the EPA's standards for \"healthy\" air quality. O3 is a main component of photochemical smog and can cause inflammation of the lungs, difficulty breathing and increased risk of asthma attacks, bronchitis, and lung infections. Salt Lake City lies near a major mining facility, U.S. Magnesium, that produces of 14% of the world's magnesium for use in metal alloys, batteries, and bombs. This facility emits reactive halogen gases as a by-product of their mining process and is the largest point source of reactive halogen gases in the U.S. The complex role that halogen chemistry plays in the production of tropospheric O3 is not well understood. Therefore, understanding the impact of these halogen emissions on summertime O3 formation is critical in designing effective air quality management strategies in Salt Lake City. It's been well established that O3 is produced in the atmosphere through a complex series of reactions involving the oxidation of Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) in the presence of Nitrogen Oxides (NOx). The presence of halogens can lead to an increase in O3 concentrations by increasing downwind NOx and oxidant concentrations (as it does in the wintertime in Salt Lake City) or lead to a decrease in O3 production through catalytic loss cycles (as it does in the stratosphere). In this work, we use NOx, O3, and VOC data collected at Hawthorne Elementary in downtown Salt Lake City as input to an explicit box model containing >15,000 reactions, the Framework for 0-D Atmospheric Modeling (F0AM), to compare predicted O3 concentrations with and without halogens. We find that model predictions of O3 in the region are sensitive to unmeasured reactive halogen concentrations and unmeasured secondarily produced semi-volatile VOC concentrations. Our results underscore the need for better local constraints to decrease uncertainty in predictions of O3 concentrations under future potential emissions scenarios.","metadata":{"date":1708639781000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947473824.45\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240222193722-20240222223722-00699.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9176369309,"token_count":421,"url":"https:\/\/our.utah.edu\/urs\/understanding-the-impact-of-halogens-on-tropospheric-ozone-concentrations-in-salt-lake-city\/"},"score":4,"id":"91"}
{"text":"Hey all you Radio KRUD fans (if such a thing exists anymore)! Rival Dave is back from a hefty hiatus. I\u2019ll have to admit that I got really bored with the whole format of the thing, which is why I couldn\u2019t bring myself to update for so long. I\u2019m going\nto try and change up my writing style a bit so I can rediscover what I originally loved about the whole KRUD thing and avoid falling into that rut again.\nSo to start with, I guess I should get to a band that quickly became a personal favorite of mine after they submitted music to me a few years ago: The Passive Aggressives. Not only are they an incredibly talented group with a unique sound, but I feel like I owe a debt to them. When they sent me a second album to review, I found the standard promotional material slipped inside the CD case, but wasn\u2019t I surprised when my previous post about the band was quoted alongside reviews from magazines and other more traditional media outlets.\nWith flattery like that, I feel guilty for getting to their album Conflict Resolution practically two years after it was released. At least I can hope that that any hype, no matter when it comes out, is always beneficial. And, like I said, I owe the band for thinking enough of my post to quote it in their promo material.\nSo here we go\u2026\nThe Passive Aggressives: Jose Santiago (Vocals, Guitars, and Percussion), Keren Gaiser (Lead Vocals, Percussion, and Keyboards), Damian Lynch (Vocals, Bass, Ukulele, and Percussion), and Tim Dayner (Vocals, Drums, and Percussion)\nFirst of all, let me say that The Passive Aggressives seem to have come a long way in such a short amount of time between their self-titled EP and Conflict Resolution. They, of course, still have that heavy-hitting, crunchy, and bass-laden sound they established in their EP, which is evident in songs like \u201cSoundtrack to the Voices in My Head.\u201d I\u2019m actually listening to Conflict Resolution on my PS3 as I write this post (my PC isn\u2019t putting out good sound write now, so my PS3 is my best bet for good sound output), and when I looked back to the TV as that track started, the visualizer was of a hilly landscape rushing towards the screen. It was a strangely appropriate image what with the fast pace of the song, the deep, pounding drums, the motor-like buzz of the guitars, and the frantic, sometimes snarling, vocals. It\u2019s not hard to imagine yourself jetting down a long stretch of highway, watching the scenery fly by with \u201cSoundtrack to the Voices in My Head\u201d blasting out of speakers.\nBut The Passive Aggressives have also shown with Conflict Resolution that they are capable of producing soft, emotional songs that rock just as hard, such as \u201cSlice It Away.\u201d This is one of those songs where it\u2019s hard to tell exactly what message or story the lyrics are supposed to convey, which is a good thing. The lyrics are clever, emotionally evocative, and they leave the listener thinking and coming up with their own interpretation. The beginning line, \u201cI open up my eyes to find pills at my fingertips,\u201d along with lines like, \u201cThis present situation is mostly self-inflicted,\u201d and, \u201cHead that\u2019s been aching for days, so much that I can\u2019t see straight,\u201d would make one think that this is just a song about struggling with drug addiction. Then there are lines about \u201cflashing headlights,\u201d \u201ctraffic copters circling,\u201d and \u201cfloating through a spiderweb of shattering glass,\u201d which is a really clever image, by the way. So did the person in this song just get into a car crash and fly through their windshield as a result of drugs and alcohol? I\u2019m guessing so. But no matter what your interpretation is, it\u2019s a great song that you will want to listen to several times over.\nThen there\u2019s weirder songs like \u201cLulla-Bye Nation,\u201d which kinda sounds like\u2026 well, a lullabye. I don\u2019t know who of you will recognize this other song, but it reminded me of \u201cDarlin\u2019 Ukulele\u201d by Jolie Holland since they\u2019re both catchy, simple little tunes with minimal instrumentation (i.e. a ukulele and a xylophone). \u201cLulla-Bye Nation\u201d sort of digresses from the sound and style of the rest of the album, but The Passive Aggressives are by no means a traditional rock band, so it\u2019s a strange fit with the inherent weirdness of The Passive Aggressives (not that weirdness is a bad thing, mind you).\nSpeaking of weirdness, The Passive Aggressives even do a cover of \u201cHappy Together\u201d by The Turtles. I\u2019ll admit that when I first heard this song, or when I first hear most covers for that matter, I was immediately dismissive. \u201cWhat the hell have they done to this classic pop song?\u201d That\u2019s what I thought to myself. But eventually I had to realize that there\u2019s nothing wrong with a unique interpretation of a song, no matter how thoroughly it\u2019s ingrained into our cultural unconsciousness. What\u2019s especially unique about this cover are the odd vocal harmonies. Keren Gaiser takes the lead with her sultry singing and one of the other members (I honestly don\u2019t know which one) harmonizes in a deep, breathy voice. The contrast between the two vocals is so great that it puts you off at first, but they end up working really well together once you get into the song. Add onto that strange vocal mix some grinding guitars, a thumpy, funky bass, and a trippy guitar solo and you get a cover of \u201cHappy Together\u201d unlike any other you\u2019ve heard before.\nSo to summarize Conflict Resolution and The Passive Aggressives as a whole: funky, crunchy, thumpin\u2019, bumpin\u2019, sometimes mellow, always rockin\u2019, and definitely weird, but weird in the best way possible.\nWell, that\u2019s about it for this post. Hopefully, I can keep up with a decent pace with the posts in the future.

{"text":"1. What is Logistics and Supply Chain Management?\nLogistics typically refers to activities that occur within the boundaries of a single organization and Supply Chain refers to networks of companies that work together and coordinate their actions to deliver a product to market.\nAlso, traditional logistics focuses its attention on activities such as procurement, distribution, maintenance, and inventory management.\nUnderstanding logistics entails an understanding of the basics of supply chain management. Supply Chain Management (SCM) acknowledges all of traditional logistics and also includes activities such as marketing, new product development, finance, and customer service.\n2. What is Logistics?\nLogistics is about getting the right product, to the right customer, in the right quantity, in the right condition, at the right place, at the right time, and at the right cost (the seven Rs of Logistics)\u201d .\nIn the past, various logistics tasks were under different departments, but now they are under \u201clogistics department\u201d and report to the same logistics head\nWe would like to point out that the word \u201clogistics\u201d ends with the \u201cs\u201d. Without the \u201cs\u201d (logistic), it means a kind of mathematical function showing exponential growth.\n3. What is Logistics Management?\nLogistics Management deals with the efficient and effective management of day-to-day activity in producing the company\u2019s finished goods and services.\nThe basics of logistics management include understanding the basics of supply chain management, warehousing, transportation and managing inventories.\n4. What is the Difference between Inbound and Outbound Logistics?\nInbound Logistics refers to the movement of goods and raw materials from suppliers to your company. In contrast,\nOutbound Logistics refers to the movement of finished goods from your company to customers.\nTo illustrate this term, we make a small graphic as below:\nAs you can see above, purchasing and warehouse function communicates with suppliers and is sometimes called \u201csupplier facing function\u201d. Production planning and inventory control function is the center point of this chart. Customer service and transport function communicate with customers and are sometimes called \u201ccustomer facing functions\u201d.\n5. What is Transport and Logistics?\nTransport and Logistics refers to 2 types of activities, namely, transportation (traditional services such as air\/sea\/land transportation, warehousing, customs clearance) and logistics (value-added services which including information technology and consulting)\n6. What is International Logistics and Global Logistics?\nInternational logistics, global logistics and global supply chain are one of the most ambiguous groups of terms out there. They are used interchangeably and often referred to international production and transportation activities. However, the most concise definition of international logistics or global logistics is as below.\n\u201cInternational Logistics (also known as Global Logistics) focuses on how to manage and control overseas activities effectively as a single business unit. Therefore, companies should try to harness the value of overseas product, services, marketing, R&D and turn them into competitive advantage\u201d\n7. What is 3PL or Third Party Logistics?\nThe concept of Third Party Logistics or 3PL appeared on the scene in the 1980s as the way to reduce costs and improve services which can be defined as below:\n\u201c3PL or Third Party Logistics refers to the outsourcing of logistics activities, ranging from a specific task, such as trucking or marine cargo transport to broader activities serving the whole supply chain such as inventory management, order processing and consulting.\u201d\nIn the past, many 3PL providers didn\u2019t have adequate expertise to operate in complex supply chain structure and process. The result was the inception of another concept.\n8. What is 4PL or Fourth Party Logistics?\nFourth Party Logistics or 4PL is the concept proposed by Accenture Ltd in 1996 and it was defined as below,\n\u201c4PL or Fourth Party Logistics refers to a party who works on behalf of the client to do contract negotiations and management of performance of 3PL providers, including the design of the whole supply chain network and control of day-to-day operations\u201d\nTop 3 reasons why customers would like to use 4PL providers according to the research by Nezar Al-Mugren, are as below:\n\u2013 Lack of technology to integrate supply chain processes\n\u2013 The increase in operating complexities\n\u2013 The sharp increase in global business operations.\n9. What is Supply Chain?\n\u201cSupply Chain is the network of organizations that are involved, through upstream and downstream linkages, in the different processes and activities that produce value in the form of products and services in the hands of the ultimate consumer\u201d \u2013 from Logistics and Supply Chain Management by Martin Christopher.\n10. What is Supply Chain Management?\nEach researcher defines supply chain management differently. However, we would like to provide the simple supply chain management definition as below,\n\u201cSupply Chain Management (SCM) refers to the coordination of production, inventory, location, and transportation among the participants in a supply chain to achieve the best mix of responsiveness and efficiency for the market being served\u201d \u2013 from Essential of Supply Chain Management by Michael Hugos\nWhat does a logistics and supply chain management course entail?\nThe coursework in a logistics and supply chain management program will cover topics such as introduction to logistics and supply chain management, procurement, inventory control, warehousing, transportation, customer service, and global supply chain management.\nStudents will learn how to apply various analytical tools and methods to solve problems in logistics and supply chain management. In addition, they will also get a chance to develop their negotiation, leadership, and communication skills.\nGraduates of a logistics and supply chain management program can find employment in a variety of industries such as manufacturing, retail, transportation, warehousing, and logistics. They can work in positions such as supply chain analyst, purchasing manager, logistics manager, transportation manager, and customer service manager.","metadata":{"date":1709134632000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947474737.17\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240228143955-20240228173955-00897.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9576942325,"token_count":1230,"url":"https:\/\/clariongr.com\/10-basics-of-logistics-and-supply-chain-management-you-should-know\/"},"score":4,"id":"93"}
{"text":"Humoresques Op. 101 (1894)\nFrom 1892 to 1985, Dvorak held the post of Director of the National Conservatory in NewYork. During this time, he penned down many thematic notes in his sketch books, whicj were later to be used in various compositions. While in holiday in the summer of 1894, in his beloved summer home in Vysok\u00e1 in Bohemia, he worked out some of these sketches into a cycle of 8 piano pieces. Initially, the cycle had no title yet. The composer considered naming them \"New Scotch Dances\" (after an earlier set of Ecossaises he wrote) but eventually settled for the title Humoresques. They were published as Op.101 in August of the same year by his Berlin publisher Simrock.\nThese delightful miniatures show Dvorak's ever-fresh inspiration at its best, and are notable for the influences of his 'American' period (for example, the theme of the fourth Humoresque was described by the composer as \"Hiawatha's child theme\", destined for an opera on that was never to materialize). The mood varies between gentle melancholy and blissful contentedness.\nThe seventh Humoresque in G Flat Major has become one of the most popular classical pieces in existence, and the publisher Simrock made vast amounts of money on it by publishing it separately in arrangements for all possible and impossible instruments and ensembles, even, in the U.S.A., in a version for choir.\n|Humoresque No.7 in G flat major","metadata":{"date":1708956763000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947474660.32\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240226130305-20240226160305-00399.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9764364362,"token_count":325,"url":"http:\/\/www.pianosociety.com\/pages\/dvorak_humoreques\/"},"score":3,"id":"94"}

{"text":"In a case report released on 21 September 2020, the German Foundation Central Agency Packaging Register (ZSVR) describes the case involving an IT system house.\nEvidently a large group of affiliated IT trading companies with their own direct (IT system house) sales organisation has failed to meet its product responsibility for packaging and has been violating its obligations under packaging law for years now. The companies are manufacturers of a substantial volume of packaging subject to mandatory system participation. They fill their packaging items with goods and place them on the market. The companies in question thus are manufacturers\/first distributors under the Packaging Act for the relevant sales, repackaging and, in particular, packaging for shipment. By failing to participate in the system, the companies have gained unjustified competitive advantages over competitors who have behaved in conformity with the law.\nThe group of companies has evidently been practising this for years despite having its own legal department, compliance officer and, contrary to the appearance of product responsibility being created by publishing a number of sustainability reports. Sales-, repackaging and shipment packaging of information technology equipment (e.g. screens, keyboards, mouse-like pointing devices, printers, notebook computers, desktop PCs, servers, storage units such as hard disks, memory cards, USB sticks) is predominantly collected by far from private end consumers comparable sources (such as administrations, public authorities and offices of large commercial enterprises) as contemplated by Section 3 (11) of the German Packaging Act. Accordingly, they are almost without exception obliged to participate in the system provided under the Packaging Act.\nAs manufacturers within the meaning of the Packaging Act, the companies only registered in the LUCID packaging register after the ZSVR notified them of their unlawful omission. In response to the notice by the ZSVR, the companies have subsequently registered in the LUCID packaging register. However, manufacturers of packaging subject to mandatory system participation must register before placing such articles on the market; cf. Section 9 of the Packaging Act.\nFor years, the companies have not participated in one or more systems for their packaging quantities, thus violating Sections 6 respectively 7 of the Packaging Act. There are concrete indications of administrative offences having been committed. These can be punished for each offence with a fine of up to 100,000 euros under the Packaging Ordinance or 200,000 euros under the Packaging Act.\nFailing system participation regarding the quantities of packaging, and since 2019 also failing registration, the companies should not have placed their packaging on the market; cf. Section 6 (1), sentence 3 of the Packaging Ordinance as well as Section 7 (1), sentence 4 and Section 9 (5) sentence 1 of the Packaging Act. There are concrete indications of administrative offences having been committed. These may be punished for each offence with a fine of up to 100,000 euros.\nThe ZSVR has notified the competent state enforcement authority that there are concrete indications of regulatory offences having been committed. Possible consequence of such administrative offences provide for the imposition of fines including profit skimming as well as the monitoring of mandatory system participation for past periods. To the extent that registration and system participation per company is not yet fully in place, a distribution ban on packaging subject to system participation likewise applies by law. The ZVSR will examine whether the registered companies comply with their further obligations regarding system participation and data reporting and, if applicable, the depositing of declarations of completeness. The ZSVR or the competent federal state authority may also demand at any time that a declaration of completeness be deposited in the LUCID packaging register, even if the values fall below the defined thresholds.\nIf you have any questions on the Packaging Act as well as mandatory system participation, please do not hesitate to contact the take-e-way consultants by calling +49\/40\/750687-0 or sending an e-mail to firstname.lastname@example.org.","metadata":{"date":1708589896000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947473735.7\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240222061937-20240222091937-00299.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9549947977,"token_count":801,"url":"https:\/\/www.take-e-way.com\/news\/it-system-house-faces-sanctions-for-failure-to-comply-with-system-participation-obligation\/"},"score":2,"id":"96"}
{"text":"What is epilepsy?\nEpilepsy is a name for a condition that causes brief disturbances in the normal electric function of the brain. These disturbances are called seizures. Another name for epilepsy is \u201cseizure disorder.\u201d In someone who has epilepsy, the normal activity in the brain is interrupted by bursts of activity that are more intense than usual. These bursts may cause symptoms that no one else is aware of, like a strange feeling in the body or a certain taste, smell or sight. At other times, the symptoms may be visible, like loss of consciousness (\u201cblacking out\u201d) or body movements that can't be controlled (\u201cconvulsions\u201d). When the activity in the brain causes any of these symptoms, the person is said to be having a seizure.\nWhat is the difference between epilepsy and seizures?\nSeizures are the events caused by the short disruption of the brain's normal activity. They are a sign of epilepsy. Epilepsy is the underlying tendency of the brain to produce seizures. Sometimes a person will have a seizure if the brain gets irritated\u2014such as from a fever or a medicine side effect. This kind of seizure doesn't necessarily mean the person has epilepsy. A person has epilepsy when the brain's activity is disrupted and seizures happen over and over again.\nAre seizures dangerous?\nSome seizures, especially those that cause a person to lose consciousness or to fall down, can cause injuries. Although life-threatening complications from a seizure are rare, people who have repeated seizures are at risk for serious complications. So it's best for people with epilepsy to have treatment to prevent seizures from happening.\nWhat causes epilepsy?\nEpilepsy can have many causes. These include serious head injuries, the after-effects of an infection, problems in the way the brain developed before birth, and genetic (inherited) conditions. Many people with epilepsy haven't had a brain injury. Often, no cause for epilepsy can be found.\nIf I have epilepsy, will my children have it, too?\nSome kinds of epilepsy run in families, but many kinds don't. Most children whose parents have epilepsy don't get it themselves. Your doctor can tell you what kind of epilepsy you have and if it might run in your family.\nHow does the doctor know I have epilepsy?\nYour doctor will ask questions that will help him or her tell if you have epilepsy. Tests like the electroencephalogram (EEG) and brain scans may also give helpful information. The EEG is a test that records the electric activity of the brain. The brain waves that happen during or even between seizures may show certain patterns that help your doctor decide if you have epilepsy. Brain scans, like computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), provide a picture of your brain. The scans may show a scar, a growth or another condition that could be causing epilepsy.\nHow is epilepsy treated?\nMany medicines may be used in patients with epilepsy to stop seizures from occurring and to reduce the frequency or severity of seizures. In many patients with epilepsy, medicine completely controls seizures\u2014that is, the person doesn't have any seizures while taking the medicine. In other patients, seizures are harder to control. Several medicines may need to be tried before the best one is found. Some patients have side effects from one medicine and have to try another one. In some patients, the seizures aren't completely stopped by medicine. These patients may be referred to doctors who are epilepsy specialists. They can often offer other treatments for epilepsy, including surgery.\nHow can I help control my seizures?\nWork closely with your doctor. Take your medicine as instructed. Help your doctor to know if the medicine is working for you by keeping track of any seizures or side effects in a diary or on a calendar. Try to have a regular sleep schedule. Changes in your sleep pattern might make seizures more likely. Avoid drinking alcohol, especially if it tends to provoke your seizures.\nWhere can I find out more about epilepsy?\nA great place for information on epilepsy is the Epilepsy Foundation of America. They can send you a catalog of publications about epilepsy and offer other assistance. You can telephone toll-free by calling 1-800-EFA-1000. An Internet Web site on epilepsy is available at www.efa.org.","metadata":{"date":1708470686000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947473347.0\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00299.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9447550178,"token_count":885,"url":"https:\/\/www.aafp.org\/pubs\/afp\/issues\/1998\/0401\/p1603.html"},"score":4,"id":"97"}
{"text":"The holidays are here and many people are making plans for family gatherings. For some, these gatherings will take them home for family reunions, formal or informal. We have become such a far-flung society, that it is only at vacation and holiday times that we often get to see some of the family.\nOf course, for those who are just beginning to get involved in genealogical research, this is the ideal time to see what the family may remember. Of course, you can't just show up on someone's doorstep and start quizzing them. If you cannot contact them ahead of time, you need to have a plan for the types of questions you are going to ask.\nHolidays offer a way to get family info.\nName, Rank and Serial Number\nFrom experience, asking them when great grandpa Ted was born is not the most effective method. Invariably, they will shake their head and tell you they just don't remember. Instead of asking such direct questions, you will want to ask them about things they will remember. Ask them about going to school or holiday celebrations. Ask them about their first car or about when they moved into a house or to the farm.\nThese are the types of events that people remember. While they are telling these stories you can interject questions about how old they were then or if great grandpa Ted was there for that Christmas or birthday and if so how old was he.\nWithout their realizing, as they answer your questions, they will be supplying you with the information you need to those drier questions, such as just when was great grandpa Ted born. When put in the context of their life, they have something to pull out of their memory, and it will make a difference in the information they share.\nWorking with the Information\nArmed with this information, you can then begin to create a timeline that will hold the clues to approximate dates of birth and marriage and death for many of the family members. This gives you the starting point for your genealogy. At this point you can begin to see what record types might be of use to you.\nOnce you have the timeline, you can begin to put the pieces together in your genealogy software. Then as you get records that verify this information, you can include the source citations in your database. And before you know it you will be a full-fledged genealogist, complete with the database back six or more generations.\nDon't Let the Chance Slip By\nIf you are going to see the family over the holidays, don't let the opportunity get away from you to talk with them. You never know when it will be your last. We always think we have unlimited time and before you know it, you find yourself the oldest living relative with many regrets.\nSome of my fondest memories are of sitting at the table talking with my grandfather about his first job, and when he and my grandmother were first married. Pictures that he showed me had a story. They stopped being two-dimensional and came alive. And while I didn't get to videotape these times, I have my notes and hopefully my memories for time to come and I have the pictures as well.\nGetting started with genealogy need not be overwhelming. Talking with family is the best way to begin. And if you jump right into the records sometimes you don't get around to talking to the family until much later. Sometimes you miss out that way. Don't let it happen to you.\nRhonda R. McClure is a professional genealogist specializing in celebrity trees and computerized genealogy. She has been involved in online genealogy for fifteen years.

{"text":"Polyimides by nature are highly resistive materials which exhibit exceptional thermal and chemical stabilities. Yet, there are a number of instances in which a polymeric material displaying low resistance and featuring similar physical, chemical, and thermal characteristics as polyimide would be desirable. Toward this goal, multilayered polyimide composite films have been produced through the homogeneous incorporation of copper salts and complexes into poly(amide acid) followed by thermal processing. In this way, highly anisotropic copper containing composite films have been obtained which feature a surface or near-surface layer of copper metal or copper oxide as the conductive medium.\nThe surface resistivity of the composites is lowered up to ten orders of magnitude relative to unmodified polyimide films. However, in many cases, the discontinuity of the copper containing layer limits the attainment of near-theoretical resistivity. Hence, evaluation of the composites by a variety of analytical techniques have been used to develop structure-process-property relationships in order to optimize the electrical properties of these materials.\nThe surface treatment of polymeric materials by glow discharge is known to improve their adhesive strength when in contact with a large number of other substances, be they polymeric, metallic, or ceramic in nature. Many efforts have been made to characterize this phenomenon, however in most instances, details concerning the interfacial structure and adhesion mechanism are not fully understood.\nThe second part of this Dissertation describes the structure and chemistry occurring in the interfacial region between sputter-coated titanium metal, and both plasma pretreated and nonpretreated polyethylene terephthalate (PET) film. The effect of plasma pretreatment on nonmetallized PET is discussed as well. Upon application of a gaseous plasma, titanium\/polyester adhesion increases dramatically following metallization compared to the nonpretreated analog. In order to relate this phenomenon to a physical and\/or chemical change X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Auger electron spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, as well as, surface Fourier transform infrared spectrometry have been used to characterize both the surface and interfacial regions of these films.","metadata":{"date":1709236354000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947474852.83\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240229170737-20240229200737-00698.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9095828533,"token_count":445,"url":"https:\/\/vtechworks.lib.vt.edu\/items\/8a01acad-cfe5-43c1-b91d-9dc1c9e2b26b"},"score":3,"id":"99"}

Here is a short list of the best ideas and habits to use every day in order to be more successful in life. All of these tips require some planning and preparation but are worth the effort.\n1. Set Daily Goals\nGoals are an important aspect of getting things done, and they increase your productivity. Without a doubt, the best system for daily goal-setting continues to be SMART goals.\nSMART stands for specific, measurable, achievable, relevant and time-bound. This method of goal-setting allows you to set and accomplish your goals in a manner that is easy to understand. Your daily goals must be concise, able to be measured in some way, within certain reasonable parameters and sensible.\nA good SMART goal must be completed in a specific time frame for it to be effective. Goals that are not time-bound tend to drag on forever, never getting accomplished.\n2. 'Eat Frogs' Every Day\nMost people focus the majority of their effort on their most trivial tasks during the day. And while focusing on these less-important tasks, the fewer but more important tasks remain undone.\nAccording to the 80\/20 rule, it's best to focus on the most important tasks at the beginning of your day. In other words, eat that day's frog \u2014 that one important task you have been avoiding or do not look forward to. If you feel the need to procrastinate, ignore those other low-value tasks. Those few frogs you have been ignoring are going to be the tasks that catapult you towards success.\nEvery morning, write out your tasks and look for the most important one \u2014 the one that will make a real difference in your day. That task is your frog and should be worked on immediately. Don't be tempted to stop before completing it and start on other less important tasks. Keep going until that high-value task has been accomplished. If you commit to this activity every day, it will soon be easy to eat those frogs.\n3. Learn Time Management\nTime management is a skill set anyone can learn. But unfortunately, not enough people put effort into learning it. Again, for time management to be effective, it must be practiced daily.\nHere are some specific time management tips to help guide you:\n\u2022 Remember that instilling a sense of discipline in yourself is key. Many people view time as an unlimited resource. Be sure not to develop this mindset. Time is a valuable commodity that must be treated as such.\n\u2022 Try to develop a daily routine that works best for you. Always be mindful of the time you are spending on tasks. If you find yourself mindlessly working on something, force yourself to ask, \"Is this really important?\"\n\u2022 Make sure that every task you commit to has value. It is too easy to be become distracted by things such as email, social media and co-workers.\n\u2022 Make sure you balance your work life with activities that help manage stress. Professionals who are overworked and burned out are not very effective. Make time to exercise, meditate and sleep. Proper time management will help you stay organized and focused.\nDo you apply any of these techniques in your daily routine? What's your favorite way to get more done?","metadata":{"date":1709366849000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947475757.50\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240302052634-20240302082634-00799.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9656778574,"token_count":827,"url":"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/forbescoachescouncil\/2018\/03\/21\/three-surefire-ways-to-get-more-stuff-done\/"},"score":3,"id":"101"}
{"text":"The All-Star break has passed, and after a short break we are back to regular season WNBA. The drive for the playoffs really starts now, and we have some great matchups tonight. Let\u2019s take a look.\nPhoenix Mercury @ Washington Mystics\nThis game should be great to watch. For the Mercury, however, they are once again missing Diana Taurasi and Essence Carson. It all starts with Brittney Griner (11.4k DK, 8.2k FD), and she should put up huge numbers, even though Washington has a stout defense. I believe LaToya Sanders and Emma Meesseman should have issues dealing with Griner\u2019s size. With that said, Griner is very expensive, and I would not blame you if you wanted to take those dollars elsewhere.\nEssence Carson\u2019s absence has opened up a starting spot for Sophie Cunningham (4.5k, 3.6k). Though Cunningham is not a huge fantasy point producer, she is at a very low price, and cannot be ignored as she should play close to mid-twenties minutes. Hopefully she will be able to knock down some threes, and hit value.\nMore from WNBA\n- Bet $5 on Sparks vs. Sky, Win $150 Instantly with Limited-Time DraftKings Promo\n- Cash in for Over $2,000 With WNBA Promo Bonuses from FanDuel & Caesars\n- FanDuel WNBA Promo Code Gives You $2,500 Bonus for ANY Game Tonight!\n- Unlock $200 GUARANTEED With Crazy DraftKings WNBA Promo\n- Unlock Over $4,500 Bonus With 3 Best WNBA Sportsbook Promos!\nOn Washington\u2019s side, I\u2019d first like to spotlight Natasha Cloud (7.4k, 5.4k). Cloud has been handling the ball a lot this year, and has combined that productivity with an absurd amount of minutes recently. In non-blowouts in the last month, Cloud is averaging 35 minutes per game. This amount of minutes, combined with her low price (especially on FanDuel!) makes her a great play.\nElena Delle Donne (10.8k, 8.4k) is always worth a mention, and her price is much more appealing than Brittney Griner\u2019s on DraftKings. Somehow, she is the fourth most expensive player on the slate, despite being a top two player by fantasy point productivity.\nChicago Sky @ Connecticut Sun\nChicago takes on Connecticut in this game, another game I will be keeping a close eye on for the upcoming playoff race. Chicago is by far my least favorite team for daily fantasy purposes, as they have played a big rotation this year, and tend to get a lot of players involved. This boils picking Chicago\u2019s players down to prices, and the only player who seems slightly underpriced is Stefanie Dolson (7.7k, 5k). Dolson has had a bounceback year, and even played 32 minutes last game. She is a great option, even against a good defensive team in the Sun.\nConnecticut draws a good matchup against the up-tempo Sky. This higher tempo should help the Sun backcourt, with Courtney Williams (7.8k, 6.1k) and Jasmine Thomas (9.2k, 6.2k) pushing the pace. While they are both solid plays, I am not certain that they are both going to be able to eclipse 30 fantasy points. Because of this, I would recommend only playing one of the two in a lineup, as if Jasmine Thomas has an incredible game, it is unlikely that Courtney Williams will also do so.\nDallas Wings @ Las Vegas Aces\nLastly, to cap off the night, Dallas heads to Las Vegas to take on the Aces. Normally, I like to target the team who plays the Aces, as the high pace allows for more rebounds, points, and assists, but it is tricky in this case. Dallas\u2019 rotation has been tricky to figure out, aside from a few key players. Arike Ogunbowale (8.5k, 6.1k) should be good for 15+ field goal attempts, and if you catch her on a hot shooting day, she certainly could return 30 or even 40 fantasy points. As well, Kayla Thornton (8.2k, 6.2k) seems to be the only other real mainstay, and she has played over 35 minutes multiple times this season. Her all-around contribution really helps in scoring fantasy points.\nFor Las Vegas, A\u2019ja Wilson is once again out. You probably already know the drill, but Dearica Hamby (9.4k, 5.2k) will draw another start. Hamby is essentially a free square on FanDuel, as for some reason they refuse to raise her price. Liz Cambage (10.9k, 8.3k) has been a force without Wilson, and should continue that trend against her former team. Lastly, Kelsey Plum (6.9k, 4.6k) has seen her minutes increase lately, and could play over 30 once again, making her a great play. The only real worry in this game is that Las Vegas gets way ahead and plays their bench for a majority of the game. Hopefully not though!\nLove our 24\/7 women\u2019s basketball coverage?

{"text":"Find a Heating System Installation or Replacement in Ravenel, South Carolina\nGive us a few details and we\u2019ll match you with the right pro.\nCOMMONLY ASKED QUESTIONS ABOUT HEATING SYSTEM INSTALLATION OR REPLACEMENT\nIs it a good idea to carry out my own heating system installation, or is professional skill necessary?\nIt's a wise idea to get the help of an experienced HVAC contractor to take care of your heating system installation project. The usual homeowner doesn't have the tools or know how to carry out a project of this sort. While a DIY job might seem like a money-saving opportunity, it can be dangerous, take longer than normal, and cost more than hiring a contractor. Recruiting a professional is usually advised because they're licensed to handle the installation, have the right tools, on-the-job experience, and provide warranties in case of any damage.\nOn average, how long can a heating system be expected to operate effectively?\nOn average, a heating system has a life expectancy of around 15 - 20 years. It can differ depending on factors such as its energy source, if it works on gas or electricity, and how frequently it's maintained. Keeping your system well-maintained goes a long way in terms of life expectancy, meaning it stays clear of debris, dirt buildup, and snow that may impede its operation. For this reason, it's crucial to routinely replace filters, ensuring that clean air is circulating throughout your home and won't affect your system. Hiring a professional HVAC contractor for heating system installations and upkeep can greatly extend your heating system's lifespan.\nWhat warranties are included in a heating system replacement?\nThere are independent warranties for labor associated with heating system installations. The manufacturer provides an individual warranty for potentially faulty parts, but they don't play a part in a professional's work. This is why it's important to recruit a dependable HVAC contractor in your area who provides an excellent labor warranty, covering repairs in case of accidental damage during the installation process. Sometimes they will charge a fee to add it, while others include it.\nWhich heating system provides the highest energy efficiency for my residential property?\nA high-performance heating system will keep your home cozy in the winter without exceeding itself. Energy costs can quickly cut into a household budget if the system is outdated or uses an energy source that takes longer to heat. One thing to think about is that the heating system's annual fuel utilization efficiency (AFUE) percentage rating, which tells you how much energy is being used to heat your property. If you have a modern heat pump or furnace, it should have a high AFUE percentage rating because they're made to meet high energy efficiency. It'll be especially efficient if it's compatible with your residential property's energy source, whether it's powered by natural gas or electricity. When you hire a heating system installation contractor, they can make sure you get an energy-efficient, high-performance system.\nFind a Heating System Installation Reputable Company On Thumbtack\nHeating systems bring warmth and comfort to a property when it get cold outside. A knowledgeable HVAC contractor will use their training and specialized tools to advise you on the sort system that's suitable for your property and within your budget. An installation project like this one isn't a great DIY project and is best executed by skilled professionals. They'll be capable of offering you labor warranties that covers accidental damage and repairs. Ultimately, recruiting a home heating professional will save you significant money and time.\nEven though you may own a robust electrical or natural gas-powered system, inspecting it to make sure the best functionality is still required. An annual maintenance inspection is generally suggested to pickup on potential problems before they get worse and handle repairs. However, after a certain number of years, every heating system will need to be replaced for a more energy-efficient model. Up-to-date heating systems are highly rated for efficiency, which means the energy used is actually heating your residential property and resulting in energy savings. A professional can tell you about units available on the market and let you know when a replacement service is required.\nIf you need a heating system installation, browse on Thumbtack for a skilled contractor in Ravenel, South Carolina.

(Image courtesy of Neary Ouk)\nMartine (left) and her daughter Neary flying to Cambodia to attend the start of Comrade Duch\u2019s trial in 2009. (Image courtesy of Neary Ouk)\nNeary testifies at the trial of S-21\u2019s Comrade Duch in August 2009. (Image courtesy of ECCC)\nDuch (right) confers with his French defence lawyer Fran\u00e7ois Roux in January 2009. (Image courtesy of ECCC)\n'To keep you is no benefit, to destroy you is no loss.'\nIn 1977, a young diplomat named Ouk Ket was recalled to Cambodia 'to get educated to better fulfil [his] responsibilities'. Left behind in Paris were his French wife and their two young children; they never saw him again. Through this tragedy, the book explores the infamous S-21 prison, the UN-backed trial of its commander, and Cambodia's years of terror.\nDuring the Khmer Rouge's four-year rule of terror, two million people, or one in every four, Cambodians, died. In describing one family's decades-long quest to learn their husband's and father's fate and the war crimes trial of Comrade Duch (pronounced 'Doyk'), who ran the notorious S-21 prison in Phnom Penh, where thousands were tortured prior to their execution, When the Clouds Fell from the Sky illuminates not only the tragedy of a nation, but also the fundamental limitations of international justice.\nIn February 2012, the international war crimes court in Cambodia handed down a life sentence to the man known by his revolutionary moniker Comrade Duch. The court found the Khmer Rouge's former security chief responsible for the deaths of more than 12,000 people at S-21 prison. Duch died in September 2020.\nDuch's conviction was historic. He was the first Khmer Rouge member to be jailed for crimes committed during Pol Pot's catastrophic 1975-9 rule when two million people died from execution, starvation, illness and overwork as Cambodia underwent the most radical social transformation ever attempted. When the Khmer Rouge took power in 1975, the entire population was driven from the towns and cities into rural gulags, where they were put to work planting rice and constructing vast irrigation schemes Designed to outdo even Mao's Great Leap Forward, it was an unparalleled disaster.\nAt the same time as the Khmer Rouge sought to refashion the country, they closed its borders, barred all communication with the outside world and turned back the clock to Year Zero. They outlawed religion, markets, money, education and even the concept of family as they pursued a revolution that would outstrip all others. In Orwellian fashion, everything and everyone belonged to Angkar, the anonymous leaders, and all loyalty was owed to them. The individual had no value beyond their utility as a working unit that could easily be replaced.\nIt was not long before the revolution began to implode, driven to destruction by the incompetence and paranoia of Angkar. Yet instead of recognising their own failings, the leaders believed unseen enemies were undermining the revolution. They sought them everywhere, both inside and outside the movement. In their pursuit of purity, they destroyed a nation.\nThis was the closed nation to which Ouk Ket returned in 1977. Like hundreds of other returnees, he was utterly unaware of the terrors being wrought in the revolution's name. Hundreds of thousands of other Cambodians perished in nearly 200 institutions like S-21 that formed an inescapable web across the country. Most of the rest died of starvation, overwork and illness in the rural gulags.\nCambodia remains defined by this cataclysmic period, and its effects are apparent today. To illustrate this era and its consequences, Robert Carmichael has woven together the stories of five people whose lives intersected to traumatic effect. Duch is one of those five, and the book tackles this complex man and his life through the prism of his trial.\nThe second person is a Frenchwoman called Neary. Her father - the returning diplomat Ouk Ket - was one of Duch's 12,000 proven victims. She was just two when he disappeared. When the Clouds Fell from the Sky is as much about Neary as it is about Duch: her efforts to find out more about the fate of her father, and her subsequent battle to accept it. Towards the end of the book, in one of its key scenes, Neary testifies against Duch at the international war crimes court in Phnom Penh.\nThe third and fourth characters are Ket and his wife Martine, who met in 1970 when they were studying at university in Paris. The fifth is Ket's cousin Sady, who never left Cambodia and who worked as a teacher in Phnom Penh after the Khmer Rouge were overthrown in 1979. Sady and Ket grew up together in 1960s' Phnom Penh, so Sady is able to tell us about Ket's early years. She also describes the reality of life under the Khmer Rouge: the forced eviction from Phnom Penh in 1975, the murder of her younger brother in 1977, the deaths of Ket's father and siblings, and her suffering in the rural labour camps. Sady's story is the experience of countless Cambodians.\nThrough these five stories, through the author's own research, through interviews with leading academics, former Khmer Rouge and ordinary Cambodians, and by following Duch's trial, which Robert did for months, the book takes the experience of one forgotten man to tell the story of a nation.\nSince we cannot grasp the concept of millions of dead, he has used the murder of one to speak for the deaths of many. In so doing the book reaffirms the value of the individual, countering the Khmer Rouge's nihilistic maxim that: 'To keep you is no benefit, to destroy you is no loss.'","metadata":{"date":1709328138000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947475701.61\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240301193300-20240301223300-00198.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9800873399,"token_count":1247,"url":"https:\/\/whencloudsfell.com\/about-the-book"},"score":3,"id":"104"}

{"text":"HOLE #1 \u2013 THE POND\nOn the right side of the fairway is a pond with shrubs and high grass surrounding it to preserve the natural environment and provide a buffer zone between the wetland and the golf course. The number and variety of aquatic and shoreline plants make this pond attractive to wildlife. Birds and mammals rely on ponds to drink, bathe and cool off, while numerous species of salamanders, frogs and aquatic insects live in or near the water. Note the bird nesting boxes in the pond area which provide additional habitat.\nHOLE #2 \u2013 THE GULLY\nThis gully has been left in its natural state to provide habitat for wildlife. This has been enhanced by the use of Jamestown fescue on the slope for the cart path. This fescue is an excellent naturalizing grass which provides habitat for chipmunks and mice, which are the prey of Great Horned Owls who inhabit the very large beech and walnut trees.\nHOLE #3 \u2013 RYE GRASS FAIRWAY\nRye grass, in this case Palmer Prelude Perennial rye, has been used on these fairways not only because it is a fine quality turf. This particular grass is hardy and drought-resistant, requiring less water than conventional grasses. This grass is much more economical to use and it saves a considerable amount of water.\nHOLE #4 \u2013 WOODLANDS\nNotice the natural woodlands to the left of the fairway. They provide a 400-foot-wide buffer strip with the adjoining farmland, making excellent cover for wildlife. It is not unusual to see turkey, deer and especially gray squirrels in this area. Look overhead in the tree branches for leafy squirrel nests.\nHOLE #5 \u2013 BUFFER ZONE\nThe natural grass to the left of this fairway serves as a buffer zone and provides further wildlife habitat. In the hollow on this hole, Jamestown fescue is the grass used to prevent erosion. This tightly woven ground cover also handles foot traffic well. It is much better to use this grass, because it is so durable, and it is low on maintenance.\nHOLE #6 \u2013 WOODLAND HABITAT\nIn the hollow to the left of the tree is an area that has been left in its natural state. The dead trees here provide habitat for woodpeckers and songbirds in the form of nest sites and insects, a valuable food resource. In addition, leaf litter, twigs and downed limbs remain on the woodland floor to return nutrients to and build the soil. This is a natural way to provide homes for the wildlife.\nHOLE #7 \u2013 RESTORED POND, WILDFLOWERS\nThe restored pond to the right of the tee has been returned to its natural state. High in the trees in this area are wood duck boxes to encourage nesting. You may also see Canadian geese, mallards or a Great Blue Heron in the pond. To the left of the tee is a wildflower area which appeals to birds and butterflies, as well as golfers. Watch for a succession of blooms which occur throughout the spring, summer and fall.\nHOLE #8 \u2013 IRRIGATION\nThe fairways at Tam O\u2019Shanter are irrigated by a fully automated system. The 680 Toto Irrigation Heads help conserve water by giving maximum coverage with a minimal volume of water. This system uses less water than conventional methods when syringing (light watering) is employed during hot summer days. This preserves the turf and this benefits golfers. It also benefits the land in that fewer chemicals are used. This is an asset to neighbors who live near the golf course rather than in a neighborhood where many subscribe to a chemical lawn service. Watch for a succession of blooms which occur throughout the spring, summer and fall on the golf course.\nHOLE #9 \u2013 NATURAL RAVINE\/HISTORY\nThis natural ravine contains oak trees that are 150 to 200 years old. The majority of the land in this county (Mercer) was a Revolutionary Land Grant to soldiers, most of whom sold off their shares, and the land was logged and then used for farming. This golf course was originally built in 1929-30 by T. Wade Walker, who sold it to Dan Sawhill in 1944. Jack and Mary Lou Kerins bought the course in 1947, and the Kerins family has operated it since then.","metadata":{"date":1709323355000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947475701.61\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240301193300-20240301223300-00499.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9496163726,"token_count":919,"url":"https:\/\/www.tamoshanterpa.com\/nature-trail\/nature-train-front-nine\/"},"score":3,"id":"106"}

{"text":"2021-10-05 The Oceans are DEEP! Checkout this video to get a sense for just how DEEP the oceans are.\nDeep water (below about 750 meters) creates problems even for simple components, like driveshaft seals. A driveshaft seal keeps water from coming up the driveshaft into the motor. When the water gets deep enough, pressure will push past any seal. You can use a labyrinth seal, but it will increase friction and reduce operating time. You can use a magnetic coupling, between a driveshaft on one side and the propeller on the other, but they have problems, including reduced peak torque transfer, additional bearings, alignment, and system complexity. You can also flood the motor with oil to keep water out, but oil really increases motor friction and reduces efficiency.\nEven simple components, like driveshaft seals, are problems at depth.

{"text":"Today, Millions More Children in America Are Struggling with Hunger\nOne child struggling with hunger is one too many. But the heartbreaking reality is that today, in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, more than 34 million people, including 9 million children, in the United States are struggling with hunger.\nTell Congress to make big investments in federal child nutrition support and keep kids fed by visiting our political advocacy arm \u2013 Save the Children Action Network \u2013 and sending a message to Congress.\nNo child can be hungry for knowledge if they\u2019re hungry for food\nStudies have shown that hunger can negatively impact children\u2019s academic performance and behavior in school, preventing them from developing to their full potential. Many studies have shown that hungry children have a hard time learning.\nHungry students are more likely to...\n- have less energy\nbe more easily distracted and less interested in schoolwork\nhave lower math scores\nrepeat a grade\n- come to school late or miss school entirely\nStatistics about child hunger in America\nToday, there are an estimated 12 million children struggling with hunger in America. While nearly every state has pockets of great disadvantage, these states struggle with child hunger the most:\n- Food scarcity is highest in Louisiana, where 25% of families with children struggle with hunger\n- In Arkansas, 23% of families with children struggle with hunger\n- Kentucky, Maryland, Oklahoma and Washington, D.C. all report a 22% rate of family hunger\n- In Maryland, Hispanic and Black families are almost 4 times as likely to face hunger as white families\n- Hispanic families are similarly disadvantaged in New York, where 38% do not have enough food, compared to 11% of white families\nChild hunger in America has hit the poorest families the hardest\nRamon, Olga and their young children have endured multiple hardships. The couple both had COVID. Olga lost her father to the disease. And it\u2019s been hard to pay bills and afford food.\nAcross the nation, the poorest families are upwards of 15 times as likely as the wealthiest to be hungry. In California, estimates suggest all of the wealthiest families have enough to eat, but half of the poorest do not.\nFor one California family specifically, food became both too expensive and too unavailable in June 2020 as COVID outbreaks began to spread rapidly across agricultural communities in the Central Valley.\n\u201cIt was a struggle to find household items and food at the markets,\u201d said Olga, a seasonal farmworker who works full-time and did not qualify for unemployment benefits or stimulus payments when both she and her husband tested positive for COVID. They got by with the help of Olga\u2019s sisters, who left boxes of food on their doorstep.\nOnce their quarantine was lifted, waiting in long food pantry drive-through lines became the family\u2019s normal way of getting the food they needed. Often they had to travel to neighboring towns.\nCOVID has been a horrific disruptor to child hunger in America\n7-year-old Kenzlie gets her temperature taken upon entering her school in Eastern Tennessee. Kenzlie is on a modified schedule due to COVID-19 and only attends school two days a week.\nEvery child deserves a bright future, yet COVID has been a horrific disruptor to progress around reducing child hunger in America.\nWith 30 million children in the U.S. depending on school for meals, school closures and loss of family income mean food insecurity rates will rise.\nNot only has the pandemic has left millions of families financially strapped and stretched to the limit as they juggle work and helping kids with remote learning, it has brought illness, loss and desperation to millions of families.\nChildren are missing out on the social, emotional and academic fundamentals of childhood. Too many are experiencing hardships and trauma that will echo through their lives and communities for years to come. In short, the pandemic has robbed kids of the normalcy that is essential to their healthy growth and development.\nUrgent action is needed to ensure all America\u2019s children can reach their full potential.\n*Read the full Childhood Report: Childhood in the Time of COVID here.\nOur child nutrition and hunger advocacy efforts in America\nSave the Children's domestic, child nutrition advocacy efforts aim to improve access of nutritious foods to children and families across the country, with a specific focus on rural communities. We work with Congressional offices, federal agencies, the White House, and partners in both the public and private sectors.\nOur advocacy efforts draw on scientific, and programmatic evidence from Save the Children\u2019s long-standing work on food insecurity and aims to end hunger for all children in the U.S.\nOur advocacy efforts include:\n- Protecting and strengthening child nutrition program benefits to support the nutritional needs of all children across America\n- Appropriately funding programs, like WIC, so all eligible families can participate with adequate benefits\n- Easing enrollment requirements so eligible families can apply without difficulty\n- Supporting childcare programs and schools so they can serve nutritious food to children\n- Preserving families\u2019 dignity when shopping with nutrition assistance benefits\n- Allowing program flexibilities for communities that face unique challenges, like transportation issues in rural communities or when natural disasters occur\n- Improving program efficiencies for families and administrative purposes\nFor more on child nutrition and hunger advocacy, visit Save the Children's political advocacy arm, Save the Children Action Network (SCAN).\nThank you for signing up!

{"text":"Perhaps no industry is more inherently prone to gigantism than energy production. Locating the raw materials, be they coal, oil or natural gas, is speculative and expensive. Refining and transporting those raw materials makes them even more costly. Turning them into electric power requires massive boilers and other machinery. Then, distributing this energy to a vast network of consumers requires a giant infrastructure.\nA Globalist\u2019s Delight\nEven worse is the prospect of running out of energy. Controlling the supply means supervising a massive portion of the world\u2019s commerce \u2014and the lives of those who consume that energy. That power presents enormous temptations to globalists.\nThe energy industry is burdened by an interconnected and bewildering network of bureaucrats employed by governments, corporations and non-government organizations. Any attempt to chart the entire network would only create mass confusion among the uninitiated.\nThe International Energy Agency\nOne non-government organization is called the International Energy Agency (IEA). Its website launches into bombastic prose that would be laughable if it were not so ominous. \u201cWe are leading a new era of international energy cooperation.\u201d It continues, \u201cWe provide authoritative analysis, data, policy recommendations and solutions to ensure energy security and help the world transition to clean energy.\u201d\nThe IEA gets its power because forty-six nations, including the United States, China, Japan and most of Europe, are its members or associates. Interestingly, most non-U.S. oil-producing countries\u2014Russia, Venezuela, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait\u2014among others\u2014are not officially affiliated with it.\nA Network of Like-Minded Bureaucrats\nThe head is Executive Director Dr. Fatih Birol. According to the brief biography on the organization\u2019s website, he has led the agency since 2015. \u201cUnder his leadership,\u201d the biography assures the inquiring reader, \u201cthe IEA has moved to the forefront of global efforts to reach international climate goals, safeguard energy security and manage the social and economic impacts of clean energy transitions.\u201d He also chairs the World Economic Forum\u2019s Energy Advisory Board.\nSuch responsibility has its rewards. Dr. Birol is a member of the Legion of Honor (France), the Order of the Rising Sun (Japan), the Order of the Polar Star (Sweden) and miscellaneous other honors from Austria, Germany and Italy. He is also a \u201cforeign member\u201d of the Chinese Academy of Engineering.\nLest readers get the idea that Dr. Birol runs a one-man show, the \u201cAbout\u201d page on the NGO\u2019s website shows pictures of eight other executives with the IEA, including directors for \u201cSustainability, Technology and Outlooks\u201d and \u201cEnergy Markets and Security.\u201d\nMaking Word Salads, but Nothing Else\nAnd these people work hard. They are currently preparing for \u201cCOP28,\u201d sometimes known as the 2023 United Nations Climate Change Conference. It begins on November 30 and lasts until December 12. and will take place in Dubai. On December 2, the IEA will host a \u201cHigh Level Dialogue on Building a 1.5C-Aligned Energy Transition.\u201d This is the first paragraph of the description of this world-changing event.\n\u201cThe COP28 Presidency-designate and the IEA, in conjunction with IRENA and supported by the UNFCCC Secretariat, have convened a series of High-Level Dialogues to build momentum between countries and companies on the energy transition in the run-up to COP28 and 1.5\u00b0C compatible energy transition pathways.\u201d\nIf that \u201cword salad\u201d proves to be indigestible, don\u2019t worry. The folks at COP28 have the world\u2019s problems well in hand. Reuters recently reported that it will launch \u201cthe world-first climate \u201closs and damage\u201d fund designed to address the destruction caused by climate change. COP28\u2019s CEO, Adnan Amin, said that they hope to raise \u201cseveral hundred million U.S. dollars.\u201d The European Union promises a \u201csubstantial financial contribution,\u201d but declined to state just how substantial that contribution will be. The United States \u201cclimate envoy\u201d former Senator John Kerry promised the Bloomberg New Economy Forum in Singapore that the U.S. would donate \u201cseveral millions\u201d to the fund.\nHow COP28 will distribute the millions was left unmentioned. Doubtless, many \u201cexperts\u201d will earn exceptional commissions, helping to create an \u201cequitable\u201d distribution model for whatever funds that the experts don\u2019t spend on their own salaries and expenses.\nThree Scenarios, Each Less Likely than the Last\nWith such massive amounts at stake, one should always appreciate the ability of bureaucrats to convince themselves that their ideas actually work. Consider the IEA\u2019s World Energy Outlook 2023.\nThe first problem with the Outlook is that it offers three different scenarios. First is the Stated Policies Scenario, referred to by the acronym STEPS. (Don\u2019t ask where the \u201cE\u201d comes from\u2014why let actual words ruin a great acronym?) It assumes that every country will pursue its current policies indefinitely. The second is the Announced Pledges Scenario (APS). That one assumes that all nations will meet their stated energy use reduction targets in full and on time. The third is the Net Zero Emissions (NZE) scenario, which assumes that global warming will not exceed an average of one and a half degrees Celsius above pre-industrialized averages.\nThe chances that any of the three scenarios will play out are scant. STEPS would require political stability in every nation of the world. Every day\u2019s newspaper refutes such an idea. Wars, revolutions, and political unrest are constant. Even without unrest, normal political processes ensure that many nations\u2019 policies will change.\nPseudo-Intelligence Mixed with Naivet\u00e9\nThe APS is even less likely. Anyone who assumes that every nation will do everything that each promises has no understanding of human nature. Every person, much less every country, sometimes makes promises that ultimately go unfulfilled. As a rule, politicians and bureaucrats are the worst offenders.\nHowever, the first two scenarios appear inevitable when compared with the third. The Net Zero goal of containing global warming to 1.5 degrees over the \u201cpre-industrial average\u201d is improbable. First, IEA admits that the present reading is already up to 1.2 degrees. The remaining breathing space is only 0.3 degrees. Second, no one has any idea what the pre-industrial average temperature was. According to Encyclopedia Britannica, the Industrial Revolution began about 1760. The earliest reliable weather statistics only go back to about 1880. However, climate historians know that the mid-eighteenth century was during a period called \u201cthe Little Ice Age,\u201d during which world temperatures were far lower than during the \u201cwarm period\u201d of the Middle Ages.\nDespite the confident rhetoric, even the most knowledgeable person in the IAE, COP28 or anywhere else has no real idea what the goal should be or how bad it will be if missed. Experts cite unusual weather patterns, but any connection between them and climate change is purely speculative. Even worse, there is no discussion of the advantages that longer and more productive growing seasons could bring.\nThe Same Tired Answer\nSo, what are the IEA\u2019s solutions to the world\u2019s energy puzzle? Most readers could probably recite them in their sleep\u2014wind and solar. The IEA\u2019s Outlook asserts, \u201cWe are on track to see all fossil fuels peak before 2030.\u201d According to its charts and graphs, coal, oil and natural gas have provided roughly 80 percent of the world\u2019s energy for decades. However, it breathlessly reports that by 2030, it will be down to 73 percent. They say this \u201cis an important shift.\u201d\nOf course, that shift has yet to happen. So far, it is only a projection. The engineers have been working on solar and wind power for a quarter-century and have yet to make a serious dent in the problem. Of course, that situation may bring a sigh of relief to the folks at the IEA. After all, if they actually solved the problem, they would go out of business. What a disaster that would be.\nPhoto Credit: \u00a9 hrui \u2013 stock.adobe.com","metadata":{"date":1709135407000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947474737.17\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240228143955-20240228173955-00899.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9450875521,"token_count":1779,"url":"https:\/\/www.returntoorder.org\/2023\/12\/through-fear-strident-words-and-sloppy-statistics-the-international-energy-agency-plots-an-eco-future\/"},"score":2,"id":"113"}
{"text":"Protesters Behead Christopher Columbus Statue: The statues keep falling. In the United States, Confederate monuments are swiftly being toppled after decades of inertia and debate.\nSpurred by the moral outrage of the Black Lives Matter protests, municipal authorities across the country have ordered century-old statues commemorating defenders of slavery to be removed. In some instances, protesters have taken matters into their own hands.\nBut things didn\u2019t just stop with the Confederacy. In numerous cities, activists have targeted statues of Christopher Columbus, the Genoese explorer who, in the service of the Spanish crown, launched a new age of European colonialism when he reached the New World in 1492.\nHis career is checkered by wanton acts of cruelty and tyranny; his legacy has come to represent for many a whole history of indigenous dispossession, exploitation and genocide.\nIn Boston, a statue of Columbus was found beheaded on Wednesday morning. Another Columbus statue in Richmond where a whole series of monuments is now set to fall was thrown into a lake.\nAnd in St. Paul, Minn., indigenous activists threw a rope around a 10-foot bronze statue of Columbus on the grounds of the state capitol and dragged it off its pedestal. Authorities did not intervene as the statue came tumbling down, and activists danced in a circle around it, singing native songs.\n\u201cFor healing to happen, this needed to happen,\u201d Mike Forcia, chairman of the Twin Cities American Indian Movement and a member of the Bad River Band of Ojibwe, told the Minnesota Reformer. \u201cIt was here for far too long.

{"text":"Hundred million years ago the snake came into existence, by slowly going from an animal with limbs to the slithering creature as we know it today. You might think that evolution worked the other way around, but if you take an x-ray of a phyton or a boa constrictor you can still see rudimentary legs in their bodies. Scientist are now trying to reverse evolution by inserting the mutated leg snake DNA into the DNA of a mouse. The test result is striking: a mouse without limbs.\nThe research was done by a Swiss University and Californian team of researchers, using the DNA editing technique called CRISPR. The scientists replaced part of the mouse DNA, a small sequence known as ZRS - the equivalent sequence from a snake. This change stopped the mouse from developing any limbs. They repeated the test with ZRS of other species, like fish and even humans, giving the mouse perfect developed legs. Because of this difference the researchers were able to prove that this specific piece of snake DNA got mutated. To wrap up the research snake ZRS and ZRS of other species got compared, concluding that only 17 codes of the DNA inside ZRS got changed; a small mutation but big enough to \u2018serpentize\u2019 a mouse.\nWhen we speak about genetic modification, we are temped to think only about future applications, like the creation of the micro pigs and CRISPRy cabbage. Whereas this research shows how genetic modification can also be used to reconstruct the evolutionary changes of the past, by turning back the clock to hundred millions years ago.\nSource: The Atlantic, Volkskrant\nImages: The Nature Conservacy, Volkskrant","metadata":{"date":1708735723000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947474470.37\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240223221041-20240224011041-00499.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9486769438,"token_count":338,"url":"https:\/\/nextnature.net\/story\/2016\/reversing-evolution-legless-mouse"},"score":4,"id":"116"}
{"text":"Is the written essay on the LSAT test important? In all reality, the written essay is equally as important as the numerical edubirdie discount code evaluation because it\u2019s the piece of promo code for essaypro paper which will ascertain whether you passed or failed. The written essay isn\u2019t scored by the LSAT but instead it is delivered to all of the law schools to which you wish to apply. Law schools all have their own scoring system and it can be very hard to understand which score you need to be expecting.\nOne of the chief reasons the written composition can help you to better score higher is the debut part. You have to provide an introduction of your own goals to the program. This will enable the interviewer know what your key objective is. The introduction must also explain why you\u2019re writing the essay. An example would be if a person is applying to be a paralegal so the intro goes into the way you became a paralegal in the first place.\nThe most important part of any good essay is the conclusion. This is where you summarize the points in the debut. It\u2019s here that you have to take a three-second pause and really think about what it is you are attempting to say. This component will also allow you to elaborate in your written essay.\nThe best advice that I can provide you regarding the writing of this essay lies with training. Essay writing is not something that you are likely to be able to master immediately. Instead, it takes weeks and sometimes months before you are ready to come up with a really superior essay. The first few essays that you write should be short but clear, simple, and concise. As you become better at composing these shorter files, the longer you\u2019ll have the ability to write because it won\u2019t be quite as stressful. You wish to keep it simple, concise, and simple to understand.\n1 final suggestion concerning the writing of this essay is to make certain you are familiar with your thesis statement. The thesis statement is the crux of your entire essay. You have to be familiar with this statement since it is going to dictate the content of your newspaper. For example, if you are writing a paper regarding the history of agriculture in the usa, your thesis statement will consist of things like how crops have grown in the Americas in relation to weather and what happened during crop seasons.\nIn the end, it should go without saying that you will need to use proper sentence structure inside your written work. To put it differently, you need to develop an orderly and logical conclusion. The debut is where your main argument is clarified as well as the thesis statement is your conclusion. You may want to look at dividing these parts of your five-paragraph essay. For instance, if you are writing an essay regarding the history of agriculture in the usa, you could split your paragraphs into a discussion of the background of agriculture in America and also a conversation of American agriculture in relation to the rest of agriculture. While this might seem like a great deal of work, it will pay off once you publish your essay and receive an A.","metadata":{"date":1708683572000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947474377.60\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240223085439-20240223115439-00899.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9656594396,"token_count":636,"url":"https:\/\/mypetsbestfriends.com\/how-to-write-an-effective-5-paragraph-essay\/"},"score":2,"id":"117"}
{"text":"New technology can be scary. It certainly presents risks and challenges. But I have to admit, one technology I am very excited about is autonomous vehicles or self-driving cars.\nWe\u2019ve talked about the potential for the Internet of Thing to leave us with nowhere to hide, and self-driving cars are part of that. We have also mused about the possibility of the government ruining self-driving cars.\nBut let\u2019s take a moment to balance those positions with the benefits of autonomous vehicles.\nFirst, it frees up so much valuable time for humans. Time is the most precious resource and morbidly limited. As many as 90% of working Americans drive a car to work. The average commute is about 25 minutes. This means an average American worker would get over 4 hours of their life back each week!\nGranted, they would still be in a car, but most people have pressing tasks that can be accomplished on a smartphone or laptop. Over the course of a lifetime, this amounts to getting a full year of your life back, that would otherwise be spent flipping off other commuters, and beeping the horn in frustration. Nevermind that most people will use that year to scroll Facebook.\nSecond, way fewer people will die in car accidents. I know it is scary to let go of control, but automation of traffic patterns will lead to far fewer roadway fatalities. Currently, about 1.3 million people worldwide die each year in traffic accidents. Many more are seriously injured.\nThe possibility that cars will be hacked is scary. But seeing as this is a pressing concern for consumers, it would be very bad publicity for whatever company has their car taken over by hackers. So far no hacker has been able to do so in industry tests which reward hackers for finding vulnerabilities in their systems.\nAlso, most cars can already be hacked. It is much easier to make a murder look like an accident when humans are behind the wheel.\nThird, economic resources that were once spent on cars and insurance will be freed up! Most people will not have to buy a car, they will simply use rideshare programs. The ones who do buy cars will likely have a much lower cost to insure the vehicle.\nFourth, we no longer have to worry about drunks, elderly, teen drivers, or distracted drivers. Think of all the social problems this immediately removes! No more debates about taking driver\u2019s licenses away at a certain age. No more tweaking regulations and legislation in a fruitless attempt to curb teen accidents.\nGo ahead and text in your car, talk on the phone, mess around with friends, and even crack open a beer! It doesn\u2019t matter, the technology is in control.\nIn America, over 10,000 deaths per year from drunk driving accidents will be prevented when all cars on the road are self-driving.\nFifth, and possibly widely overlooked, is that autonomous vehicles really throw a wrench in most excuses for the police to engage you. Police can currently pull you over when driving for almost anything. If they see a taillight out, if you cross the center line, if you are driving a bit too fast, if you speed up for a yellow light, if you swerve, and so on and so forth.\nMost people will be able to go from their own private property to the private property of a car. Then they will exit onto a business or individual\u2019s private property, and never give the government a chance to violate their rights.\nAbout 1.5 million people are arrested each year in the U.S. for Driving Under the Influence. Think of how much it costs taxpayers to send those people through the court system.\nThen there are all the people arrested for drugs after the police search their vehicles during a traffic stop. Again, the court system is unburdened. Fewer rights will be violated. Fewer illegal searches will be conducted.\nCops will be safer since they won\u2019t constantly be walking up to strangers in vehicles. People will be safer and not have to worry about being shot when a cop can\u2019t see their hands for a split second. This removes entire swaths of dangerous interactions between the police and the public.\nAutonomous vehicles might prove instrumental in changing the cultural acceptance of being stopped, questioned, and searched by officers for no real reason.\nLike with any other new technology, there will be difficulties and unforeseen dangers to autonomous vehicles. But these five benefits only scratch the surface.\nThere will be changes in the landscape, social activity, and recreation. There will be new opportunities for shipping, selling, and conducting business.\nWhat are you most worried or excited about for the advent of autonomous vehicles?","metadata":{"date":1709472913000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947476374.40\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240303111005-20240303141005-00698.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9609407187,"token_count":963,"url":"http:\/\/www.thedailybell.com\/all-articles\/news-analysis\/5-huge-benefits-of-self-driving-cars\/"},"score":2,"id":"118"}
{"text":"AL-GHURAIFAH, Egypt\u2014The tomb of a Royal Treasury supervisor has been discovered by Egyptian archeologists in a 33-foot well leading to a decorated chamber.\nThe tomb of Badi Est was found by archeologists at the Tuna Al-Jabal necropolis in Al-Ghuraifah in the Egyptian governorate of Minya. The discovery was announced Oct. 24.\nThe historical tomb dates from the Late Period of ancient Egypt, (664-323 BC) and was found with a number of well-preserved stone monuments inside.\nMostafa Waziri, a spokesperson for the Supreme Council of Antiquities, said the burial site was in the well leading to a decorated chamber with rock carvings.\nThe tomb, enclosed by stone slabs, had a pair of limestone monuments in the design of a woman and the Apis bull deity. Experts also found four alabaster jars carved with the sons of the falcon-headed deity Horus.\nThe canopic jars, used by the ancient Egyptians during the mummification process to store and preserve the owner for the afterlife, were inscribed with the names and titles of the dead.\nWaziri said they also discovered 400 statues of Ushabti, a funerary figurine used in ancient Egypt, bearing the names of the dead alongside six buried relatives.\nThese Ushabti statues reportedly held almost 1,000 ceramic figurines and other canopic jars.\nIn addition, the tomb contained scarabs, amulets and pottery from between the 26th and 30th Dynasties of Egypt, a period marked by Persian and Macedonian-Greek conquests.\n(Edited by Fern Siegel and Matthew Hall)\nThe post Egypt Archeologists Discover Tomb Of Royal Treasury Official appeared first on Zenger News.","metadata":{"date":1708691715000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947474412.46\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240223121413-20240223151413-00199.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9539174438,"token_count":372,"url":"https:\/\/jacksonvillefreepress.com\/egypt-archeologists-discover-tomb-of-royal-treasury-official\/"},"score":4,"id":"119"}

CBSE Class 7 Social Science Notes Geography Chapter 5 SST Water will seemingly help them to revise the important concepts in less time.\nWater Class 7 Notes Social Science Geography Chapter 5\nCBSE Class 7 Geography Chapter 5 Notes Understanding The Lesson\n1. The sun\u2019s heat causes evaporation of water vapour. When the water vapour cools down, it condenses and forms clouds.\n2. The process by which water continually changes its form and circulates between oceans, atmosphere and land is known as the water cycle.\n3. The same water that existed centuries ago still exists today.\n4. The major sources of fresh water are the rivers, ponds, springs and glaciers.\n5. The water of the oceans is salty or saline as it contains large amount of dissolved salts. Ocean water is 97.3% of total water available on the earth.\n6. A part of the earth surface is covered by water.\n7. Ocean water keeps moving continuously, it is never still.\n8. The movements that occur in oceans can be broadly categorized as: waves, tides and currents.\n9. When the water on the surface of the ocean rises and falls alternately, they are called waves.\n10. During a storm, the winds blowing at very high speed form huge waves.\n11. An earthquake, a volcanic eruption or underwater landslides can shift large amounts of ocean water. This results in a huge tidal wave called tsunami, that may be as high as 15 m.\n12. The rhythmic rise and fall of ocean water twice in a day is called a tide. When water covers much of the shore by rising to its highest level it is called high tide. It is low tide when water falls to its lowest level and recedes from the shore.\n13. The strong gravitational pull exerted by the sun and the moon on the earth\u2019s surface causes the tides.\n14. During the full moon and new moon days, the sun, the moon and the earth are in the same line and the tides are the highest. These tides are called spring tides.\n15. When the moon is in its first and last quarter, the ocean waters get drawn in diagonally opposite direction by the gravitational pull of sun and earth resulting in low tides. These tides are called neap tides.\n16. Ocean currents are streams of water flowing constantly on the ocean surface in definite directions. The ocean currents may be warm or cold.\n17. Generally the warm ocean currents originate near the equator and move towards the poles.\n18. The cold currents carry water from polar or higher latitudes to tropical or lower latitudes.\n19. The ocean current influence the temperature conditions of the area. Warm currents bring about warm temperature over land surface.\n20. The areas where the warm and cold currents meet provide the best fishing grounds of world.\n21. The areas where a warm and cold current meet also experience foggy weather making it difficult for navigation.\nNotes of Geography Class 7 Chapter 5 Important Terms\nEvaporation: A process through which water turns into vapour.\nTide: Rise and fall of ocean water.\nWaves: Alternatively normal rise and fall of ocean water.\nTsunami: Huge tidal waves.\nOcean currents: Streams of water flowing constantly on the ocean surface in definite directions.

{"text":"You have the right to access sexual health services and to take care of your sexual health.\nWe know that LGBTQ+ young people might feel awkward or intimidated visiting sexual health services.\nWe\u2019ve answered some of the most common questions we get from LGBTQ+ young people. We spoke to doctors nurses who work in sexual health services to make sure we could get you all the right information. To help you feel confident to access sexual health services.\nIf you are trans, the Terrence Higgins Trust has lots of additional information to help you.\nA common worry that trans and non-binary people have when visiting sexual health services is that it might trigger dysphoria and make you feel uncomfortable. You might be worried about medical staff using the wrong name, pronouns and terminology to describe your body.\nYou don\u2019t need to give staff information about your gender identity, but if you are having a check up for STIs you will have to tell the staff member what body parts you have for example, if you have a penis or a vagina. This is so they know what tests they should offer you that are right for your body.\nIt\u2019s important to be honest about your sexual and medical history, so that the team knows what treatment or support you might need. For example, who you\u2019ve been having sex with and any medication that you may take such as hormones. It can help to remember that staff in the clinic will have had lots of LGBTQ+ patients before, and some may identify as LGBTQ+ themselves\nDuring a routine STI test, you will usually be tested for chlamydia, gonorrhoea and syphilis. If you think you\u2019re experiencing symptoms related to an STI, you should tell the doctor or nurse so they can do the right test.\nThe type of tests you will need will depend on your anatomy and the type of sex you are having, so the doctor or nurse will ask you some questions about this. Most sexual health services are open to people of all genders, but there are a few which are specifically for men who have sex with men.\nTrans and nonbinary people can ask about sexual health services in their Gender Identity Clinic appointments if they have any anxieties about appointments.\nDuring a sexual health appointment, you will be asked questions about your medical and sexual history. This could include:\n- When you last had sex\n- Whether you\u2019ve had unprotected sex\n- Whether you have any symptoms\n- Why you think you might have an infection\nYou can ask to see a female or male doctor or nurse if you prefer, but you might have to wait longer than usual for one to become available.\nHere\u2019s what the NHS have to say\u2026\n\u201cWhen you go to a sexual health clinic, you\u2019ll be asked for your name and some contact details.\nYou don\u2019t have to give your real name if you don\u2019t want to. If you do, it will be kept confidential. Your GP won\u2019t be told about your visit without your permission.\nIf you have tests and the results aren\u2019t available during your visit, the clinic will need to contact you later, so give them the correct contact details\u2019\nThe clinic will ask how you want to receive your results. They can usually be given to you over the phone, by text, or in an unmarked letter.\u201d\nMost people accessing sexual health services do not need to take any clothes off in front of anyone. There might be times that you may need to, for example if you have a symptom of an STI, have pain in your genitals, or want to have a coil fitted.\nYou\u2019ll be in a private space and only the doctor or nurse will be able to see you.\nIf you do need to do this, you can ask for a doctor or nurse of the same gender as you and\/or to have a chaperone in the room.\nScreenings don\u2019t happen in sexual health services, but are provided by your GP. In Scotland everyone has a CHI number, which identifies you as male or female. If you are transgender and changed your gender marker at your GP after June 2015 you should still be invited for the screenings you need to do with your assigned sex. However, it is worth chatting to your GP about this to make sure that this happens.\nFor example, if you are a trans man you should get a smear test every 3 to 5 years and you could set yourself a reminder to make sure that you do. If you changed your gender marker before June 2015 you will need to make sure that you find out what screenings you need, and request them. NHS Inform have more information.\nYou can bring somebody with you if that would help with your anxiety. You can also ask for any other support or adjustments you may need, such as if you need thing explained in a certain way.\nIf you like to use certain names for your body parts and avoid others, you can explain this to the clinician at the start of your appointment. It can help to write it down if you find the words difficult to say, or to bring someone with you who can help you communicate what you need. You can ask to have your preferred terms put down on your clinical notes for future visits.\nYou will not be judged at all for your sexual history. The reason medical staff ask about this is so that they understand what treatment to give you and what to recommend. The main thing they want to make sure of is that you are safe and happy with the sex and relationships that you\u2019re having.\nYou can still get pregnant if you are on testosterone, unless you\u2019re also taking some form of birth control too. It\u2019s important that you use contraception to prevent pregnancy.\nSTI transmission is much less common through sex between women. However it is still possible for some STIs to be transmitted between women. Some STIs can be transmitted through skin to skin contact, exchanging bodily fluids through fingering, sharing sex toys and oral sex.","metadata":{"date":1708662819000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947474360.86\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240223021632-20240223051632-00897.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9637576342,"token_count":1248,"url":"https:\/\/lgbtyouth.org.uk\/sexual-health-clinics\/"},"score":3,"id":"121"}
{"text":"The technology market is huge. It\u2019s a multi-trillion dollar industry that touches so many different aspects of our lives. But as the market continues to grow, it\u2019s important to ask the question: can this growth be sustainable?\nIn this article, we\u2019ll explore how the technology market can align with sustainability and why it\u2019s important for both consumers and businesses alike. We\u2019ll also look at some examples of sustainable technology initiatives that are making a difference in the world.\nTechnology and sustainability\nTechnology and sustainability are not mutually exclusive. In fact, sustainable technology is one of the most important tools we have in the fight against climate change. Sustainable technology includes things like solar panels, wind turbines, and electric vehicles. These are all examples of technologies that can help us reduce our reliance on fossil fuels and move towards a more sustainable future.\nThe technology market is already starting to align with sustainability. Many sustainable tech companies are now incorporating sustainable practices into their business models. For example, Apple has been investing heavily in renewable energy. They now have over 100 megawatts of solar power capacity installed across 22 countries. This is enough to power over 60,000 homes!\nOther companies are also working on sustainable initiatives. Google has committed to powering all of its data centers with renewable energy. Facebook has also pledged to be powered by 100% renewable energy by the end of 2020.\nThese are just a few examples of how the technology market is starting to align with sustainability. But there\u2019s still a long way to go. The good news is that more and more consumers are becoming aware of the importance of sustainable technology. And as consumer demand for sustainable products increases, businesses will have no choice but to respond.\nCan Technology be Sustainable?\nThe short answer\u2014yes. Solar panels have answered this question. Wind turbines have proven it\u2019s possible. However, the long answer is that while sustainable technology is becoming more prevalent, there is still a lot of work to be done in order for it to become the norm.\nAs consumers, there are a few things you can do to help make the technology market more sustainable. First, you can support businesses that are working on sustainable initiatives. This might mean buying products from companies that use sustainable materials or that have environmentally-friendly manufacturing practices.\nYou can also spread the word about sustainable technology. Raising awareness is one of the most important things we can do to make the technology market more sustainable. We need to show businesses that there is a demand for sustainable products and that consumers are willing to support companies that are working towards sustainability.\nThe environmental cost of technology\nIt\u2019s not just the technology market that needs to be sustainable. The way we use technology also has an environmental cost. For example, the manufacturing of electronic products requires a lot of energy and resources. And when we throw away our old phones, laptops, and other devices, they end up in landfills where they release harmful toxins into the environment.\nSo what can we do to reduce the environmental cost of technology? One thing we can do is recycle our old electronics. Many retailers have recycling programs where you can drop off your old devices and they\u2019ll make sure they\u2019re recycled properly.\nWe can also be more conscious about the way we use our devices. For example, we can turn off our computers and phones when we\u2019re not using them. We can also unplug chargers and other devices when they\u2019re not in use. Every little bit helps!\nIf you really need to buy a new gadget, say a computer for school, you can choose one that lasts 5 years or more. And we have that here in Vanilla Workstations. We\u2019re proud to say that our computers and laptops are built to last classroom use for 6 years or more.\nThe future of sustainable technology\nThe good news is that sustainable technology is getting better and better. New technologies are being developed all the time that can help us reduce our environmental impact. For example, there are now solar-powered phone chargers and water bottles. There are also sustainable materials like bamboo that can be used to make phones and other devices.\nAs consumers, we have the power to demand sustainable products from the technology market. And as the market starts to respond, we will see more and more sustainable products being made available. So let\u2019s continue to support businesses that are working towards sustainability and spread the word about the importance of sustainable technology!\nThe technology market is growing at an unprecedented rate. This growth has the potential to be sustainable, but only if we take the necessary steps to make it so. By supporting businesses that are working on sustainable initiatives and by being more conscious about our own use of technology, we can make a difference. Let\u2019s work together to make the technology market sustainable!\nAbout Vanilla Workstations\nVanilla Workstations is committed to making affordable technology accessible to school districts in America.

{"text":"My \u201cTarget Moment\u201d:\nHow I Left TV News Behind\nIt\u2019s funny how the most disastrous events have a way of bringing things into focus like nothing else can. Last summer, my then TV agent talked me into going for an audition to read news for a cable operation. Maybe it was the bump on my head I sustained trying to reach past the jeans and screen T-shirts to find a suit that still fit. Maybe it was the idea of working with people again. Whatever the case, I totally forgot the resolution I made to myself about never going back to TV news.\nAfter a quick make-up touch-up, I found myself in-studio, microphone on and papers in hand, ready to go. But not before executives came out and tried to pat those unruly curls that fit my personality to a T, into a tight, tiny Afro. So there I sat, sweating like a sinner in church, make-up melting with a perfectly round, brown helmet atop my head.\nI have no qualms about saying the audition itself was a disaster. I spent two decades in TV news and yet you\u2019d have thought the text scrolling across the prompter was in Russian. Then of course, there was the \u201cBREAKING NEWS!\u201d the producer dictated into my ill-fitting earpiece, which I stammered through as best I could.\nAs humiliating as that was, the worst was still to come. I walked into the newsroom where the woman responsible for my \u2018tryout\u2019 met me at her office door. Before I got the point of my pump inside, she pronounced, rather loudly, \u201cThat was pretty bad wasn\u2019t it? Wow, what happened to you? I really expected to see the woman who left the morning show. You were not her!\u201d\nIn my defense, it was an unfamiliar setting and the first time in four years since I\u2019d read off a prompter. But what I really wanted to say was \u201cHey lady, I have been to hell and back so many times in the last four years I have a frequent user pass!\u201d I held my tongue and instead sat there with a shit-eating grin on my face. I was embarrassed and humiliated and quite frankly, stunned at this woman\u2019s ability to make a 47-year-old woman with two decades of broadcast experience, feel like a 21-year-old, still wet behind the ears. When it was over I managed a weak smile, thanked her for her candor and headed out.\nWith shoulders hunched, I began the ten-block walk toward Grand Central thankful I\u2019d grabbed my big, black sunglasses that morning. I met Buff for a quick bite and it is times like this I\u2019m so damn grateful for him. We shared a salad and the tears that had been hidden behind the glasses, finally spilled over. But a funny thing happened as well. I got strong, much stronger than I had ever been, and clear on what the path for me would look like as I moved forward. In that moment I realized it\u2019s as important to know what you DON\u2019T want to do, as it is to know what you do want. I call it \u2018The Target Moment\u2019.\nNow, please know I am not disparaging my favorite store or the hard workers who toil there. But that experience made it clear to me that I would rather work in a department store, in a job far different from the one I had trained for, rather than feel the way I felt that afternoon. That woman\u2019s words, harsh as they were, served as rocket fuel for my resolve and I dried my tears and headed home.\nI\u2019d love to wrap this up with a neat bow, something along the lines of, \u201cAnd then I landed a talk show where executives didn\u2019t try to pat my hair into a helmet and they let me be myself, which is who I\u2019m most comfortable being. There was a big signing bonus and I never had to worry about my career or money again.\u201d\nSadly that point hasn\u2019t arrived yet. But it\u2019s coming. I guess I should thank that woman for putting the final nail in the news coffin. That experience for me was like thrashing wheat where only the good stuff is left behind, but it\u2019s a violent process. I promised myself that never again would I let my hair, or me, be patted into a shape we were not meant to be.\nWhat about you, have you ever experienced your own \u2018Target Moment?\u2019 What was it and how did you move forward from it? Start sharing everyone!\n(Editor\u2019s note: This post first aired Jan 27, 2011)","metadata":{"date":1708681440000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947474377.60\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240223085439-20240223115439-00899.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9810248017,"token_count":1000,"url":"https:\/\/www.goodenoughmother.com\/2014\/02\/my-target-moment-how-i-left-tv-news-behind\/"},"score":0,"id":"123"}

{"text":"Vladimir Putin believes Western sanctions are \u201cakin to a declaration of war\u201d. The Russian President\u2019s reported comment gives a sense of his outrage at the punitive response to his invasion of Ukraine, and the impact it is already having on Russia\u2019s economy. Historically, sanctions have had a mixed track record in how they have affected the economies of target countries. In some cases, such as those legislated against Iran in 2012, economies have been brought to their knees. In others, such as sanctions against South Africa from the mid-1980s and Russia from 2014, the economic impact was more muted. What matters is the scale and scope of the sanctions, and the extent of compliance.\nThe sanctions that have been imposed on Russia following the invasion of Ukraine have been designed to insulate Western economies to a significant degree from their effects. For this reason, energy trade has (for now at least) been excluded, and asset freezes and SWIFT bans have been targeted at specific institutions. Since energy accounts for 50% of Russia\u2019s exports \u2013 and because the prices of oil and gas have surged in the wake of the war \u2013 Western governments were initially criticised for not going far enough. This was compounded by the fact that the asset freeze on Russian banks will be introduced gradually to minimise market disruption.\nHowever, the decision to impose sanctions on Russia\u2019s central bank (CBR) \u2013 effectively freezing over a half of the $630bn of foreign exchange reserves that it had amassed as part of the \u201cFortress Russia\u201d policy \u2013 will be significantly disruptive to its economy. Such sanctions severely limit the central bank\u2019s ability to support the ruble, provide foreign currency funding to commercial banks and process foreign currency payments for Russian companies.\nIt is a move almost without precedent: the only other central banks to have been sanctioned by the US are those of Iran, North Korea, Syria and Venezuela. And the hit to Russia\u2019s economy has been substantial. The sanctions on the CBR have exacerbated the ruble\u2019s collapse, threatened bank runs, and created acute strains in Russia\u2019s balance of payments. In response, the CBR has been forced to impose capital controls and hike interest rates aggressively \u2013 despite the collapse in the real economy.\nCompliance with sanctions has also been extremely strong so far. There is already evidence that sanctions are having a severe effect on cross-border transactions, including those in energy. This is perhaps best illustrated by the jump in the spread between the price of Urals crude (Russia\u2019s main export blend) and Brent. (See Chart 1.)\nChart 1: Urals\/Brent discount ($pb)\nSources: Refinitiv, Capital Economics\nStrict compliance is also reflected in a shift in corporate behaviour. BP and Shell have pulled out of multi-billion-dollar joint ventures in Russia; VW, Toyota and BMW have idled local production, and Apple and Ikea have ceased sales in the country. Many freight carriers have halted deliveries to Russia whether by air, land or sea. What\u2019s more, this pullback is not just confined to Western firms. Chinese banks have also become skittish about financing purchases of Russian oil.\nThree factors explain the corporate response. The first is that the war and the sanctions themselves have imposed logistical, legal and financial barriers to transacting with Russia. The second is that reputational concerns have caused firms to \u201cself-sanction\u201d. And the third is that companies may be trying to get ahead of a further escalation in sanctions, particularly if they are concerned about the introduction of \u201csecondary sanctions\u201d, which have been designed by the US government to force third parties to avoid dealing with targeted countries.\nWhile there\u2019s robust debate about whether these sanctions will achieve their political goals and convince Mr Putin to change his behaviour, their economic impact is far more clear cut.\nFor Russia, they will mean a huge hit to GDP and incomes. This will come in two phases. The first is a period of acute pain as the economy adjusts to the effects of sanctions. We expect a peak-to-trough fall in GDP of 8%, which would put it in the same league as the recession during the 2008\/09 Global Financial Crisis and Russia\u2019s own economic crisis back in 1998. This is likely to be followed by a prolonged period of low growth or stagnation as Russia is pushed into economic isolation and fiscal and monetary policy is kept tight in order to run the external surpluses needed to generate foreign exchange while market access is curtailed by sanctions.\nOther economies will also take a hit, though this will be much smaller and vary according to ties with Russia. Trade and financial ties are greater in Europe, and we have reduced our GDP growth forecast for the euro-zone by nearly one percent to reflect the effect of the war and associated sanctions on the region\u2019s economy. But we don\u2019t expect the post-pandemic recovery to be derailed.\nReported moves to bring energy trade within the scope of sanctions would have a larger economic impact on the euro-zone, although even in this scenario we think the region\u2019s economy would be able to weather a short-term disruption better than might be expected.\nNote: Our Europe and Commodities teams will be briefing on the outlook for Russian energy exports and Europe\u2019s energy needs in a special online briefing on Tuesday, 8th March. Here are the registration details.\nIn case you missed it:\n- In light of the Russia-Ukraine war, our Assistant Economist, Nicholas Farr, reflects on the lessons for markets from past conflicts and crises.\n- Our Senior Markets Economist, Jonas Goltermann, investigates the effect of Russia's invasion of Ukraine on domestic and global markets.\n- Our dedicated page on the war in Ukraine includes analysis of Russian energy exports, its default risks and looming banking and economic crises.","metadata":{"date":1708730612000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947474470.37\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240223221041-20240224011041-00499.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9633381963,"token_count":1216,"url":"https:\/\/www.capitaleconomics.com\/blog\/russias-economy-is-already-hurting-from-western-sanctions-worse-is-to-come"},"score":3,"id":"128"}

{"text":"By the end of this section, you will be able to:\n- Describe the pathway involved with neural sensation, integration and motor response.\nHaving looked at the components of nervous tissue, and the basic anatomy of the nervous system, next comes an understanding of how nervous tissue is capable of communicating within the nervous system. Before getting to the nuts and bolts of how this works, an illustration of how the components come together will be helpful. An example is summarized in Figure 12.3.1.\nImagine you are about to take a shower in the morning before going to school. You have turned on the faucet to start the water as you prepare to get in the shower. You put your hand out into the spray of water to test the temperature. What happens next depends on how your nervous system interacts with the stimulus of the water temperature and what you do in response to that stimulus.\nFound in the skin is a type of sensory receptor that is sensitive to temperature, called a thermoreceptor. When you place your hand under the shower (1 in Figure 12.3.1, close up in Figure 12.3.2), the cell membrane of the thermoreceptors changes its electrical state (voltage). The amount of change is dependent on the strength of the stimulus (in this example, how hot the water is). This is called a graded potential. If the stimulus is strong, the voltage of the cell membrane will change enough to generate an electrical signal that will travel down the axon. The voltage at which such a signal is generated is called the threshold, and the resulting electrical signal is called an action potential. In this example, the action potential travels\u2014a process known as propagation\u2014along the axon from the initial segment found near the receptor to the axon terminals and into the synaptic end bulbs in the central nervous system (2 in Figure 12.3.1). When this signal reaches the end bulbs, it causes the release of a signaling molecule called a neurotransmitter.\nIn the central nervous system (in this case, the spinal cord), the neurotransmitter diffuses across the short distance of the synapse and binds to a receptor protein of the target neuron. When the neurotransmitter binds to the receptor, the cell membrane of the target neuron changes its electrical state and a new graded potential begins. If that graded potential is strong enough to reach threshold, the second neuron generates an action potential at its initial segment f that graded potential is strong enough to reach threshold, the second neuron generates an action potential at its initial segment (3 in Figure 12.3.1). The target of this neuron is another neuron in the thalamus of the brain, the part of the CNS that acts as a relay for sensory information. At this synapse, neurotransmitter is released and binds to its receptor. The thalamus then sends the sensory information to the cerebral cortex, the outermost layer of gray matter in the brain, where conscious perception of that water temperature begins.\nWithin the cerebral cortex, information is processed among many neurons, integrating the stimulus of the water temperature with other sensory stimuli, as well as with your emotional state and memories. Finally, a plan is developed about what to do, whether that is to turn the temperature up, turn the whole shower off and go back to bed, or step into the shower. To do any of these things, the cerebral cortex has to send a command out to your body to move muscles.\nA region of the cortex is specialized for sending signals down to the spinal cord for movement. The upper motor neuron starts in this region, called the precentral gyrus of the frontal cortex, and has an axon that extends all the way down the spinal cord. The upper motor neuron synapses in the spinal cord with a lower motor neuron, which directly stimulates muscle fibers to contract. In the manner described in the chapter on muscle tissue, an action potential travels along the motor neuron axon into the periphery. The lower motor neuron axon terminates on muscle fibers at the neuromuscular junction. Acetylcholine is the neurotransmitter released at this specialized synapse, and binding to receptors on the muscle cell membrane causes the muscle action potential to begin. When the lower motor neuron excites the muscle fiber, the muscle contracts (Figure 12.3.3). All of this occurs in a fraction of a second, but this story is the basis of how the nervous system functions.\nCareer Connections \u2013 Neurophysiologist\nThere are many pathways to becoming a neurophysiologist. One path is to become a research scientist at an academic institution. A Bachelor\u2019s degree will get you started, and for neurophysiology that might be in biology, psychology, computer science, engineering, or neuroscience. But the real specialization comes in graduate school. There are many different programs out there to study the nervous system, not just neuroscience itself. Most graduate programs are doctoral, and are usually considered five-year programs, with the first two years dedicated to course work and finding a research mentor, and the last three years dedicated to finding a research topic and pursuing that with a near single-mindedness. The research will usually result in a few publications in scientific journals, which will make up the bulk of a doctoral dissertation. After graduating with a Ph.D., researchers will go on to find specialized work called a postdoctoral fellowship within established labs. In this position, a researcher starts to establish their own research career with the hopes of finding an academic position at a research university.\nOther options are available if you are interested in how the nervous system works. Especially for neurophysiology, a medical degree might be more suitable so you can learn about the clinical applications of neurophysiology. Biotechnology firms are eager to find motivated scientists ready to tackle the tough questions about how the nervous system works so that therapeutic chemicals can be tested on some of the most challenging disorders such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease or Parkinson\u2019s disease, or spinal cord injury.\nOthers with a medical degree and a specialization in neuroscience go on to work directly with patients, diagnosing and treating mental disorders. You can do this as a psychiatrist, a neuropsychologist, a neuroscience nurse, or a neurodiagnostic technician, among other possible career paths.\nSensation starts with the activation of a sensory receptor, such as the thermoreceptor in the skin sensing the temperature of the water. The sensory receptor in the skin initiates an electrical signal that travels along a sensory axon within a nerve into the spinal cord, where it synapses with a neuron in the gray matter of the spinal cord. At the synapse the temperature information represented in that electrical signal is passed to the next neuron by a chemical signal (the neurotransmitter) that diffuses across the small gap of the synapse and initiates a new electrical signal. That signal travels through the sensory pathway to the brain, synapsing in the thalamus, and finally the cerebral cortex where conscious perception of the water temperature occurs. Following integration of that information with other cognitive processes and sensory information, the brain sends a command back down to the spinal cord to initiate a motor response by controlling a skeletal muscle. The motor pathway is composed of two cells, the upper motor neuron and the lower motor neuron. The upper motor neuron has its cell body in the cerebral cortex and synapses with the lower motor neuron in the gray matter of the spinal cord. The axon of the lower motor neuron extends into the periphery where it synapses with a skeletal muscle fiber at a neuromuscular junction.\nCritical Thinking Questions\n1. Suppose the thalamus were damaged at the area where the second sensory neuron synapsed with the third sensory neuron. Would you be able to consciously feel the water temperature? Why or why not?\n2. Suppose the upper motor neuron were damaged. What symptoms would you expect?\n- action potential\n- change in voltage of a cell membrane in response to a stimulus that results in transmission of an electrical signal; unique to neurons and muscle fibers\n- cerebral cortex\n- outermost layer of gray matter in the brain, where conscious perception takes place\n- graded potential\n- change in the membrane potential that varies in size, depending on the size of the stimulus that elicits it\n- lower motor neuron\n- second neuron in the motor command pathway that is directly connected to the skeletal muscle\n- chemical signal that is released from the synaptic end bulb of a neuron to cause a change in the target cell\n- precentral gyrus of the frontal cortex\n- region of the cerebral cortex responsible for generating motor commands, where the upper motor neuron cell body is located\n- movement of an action potential along the length of an axon\n- region of the central nervous system that acts as a relay for sensory pathways\n- type of sensory receptor capable of transducing temperature stimuli into neural action potentials\n- membrane voltage at which an action potential is initiated\n- upper motor neuron\n- first neuron in the motor command pathway with its cell body in the cerebral cortex that synapses on the lower motor neuron in the spinal cord\nAnswers for Critical Thinking Questions\n- If the thalamus were damaged at the site of synapsing between the second sensory neuron and the third sensory neuron, signals would not reach the cerebral cortex. This would result in a person not being able to detect the temperature information consciously.\n- If the upper motor neuron were damaged, you would expect that someone would not be able to activate the lower motor neuron and then the muscle innervated by that lower motor neuron would not be able to move when brain signals asked for it to move. However, the lower motor neuron would be able to participate in.\nThis work, Anatomy & Physiology, is adapted from Anatomy & Physiology by OpenStax, licensed under CC BY.

{"text":"Outlining is a crucial part of the writing and research process, helping writers organize their ideas and structure their work in a logical and coherent manner. Whether you are a student working on a school project or a researcher writing a paper, creating an outline can be a valuable tool for ensuring that your work is well-organized and clearly presented. An outline can be thought of a writing center or skeleton for your paper or book.\nWriting a paper or essay can be a daunting task, especially if you have a lot of information to organize and present. Outlines can be a helpful tool for breaking down the writing process into manageable steps and for organizing the information you have gathered.\nThere are several different approaches to outlining that you can use depending on your needs and preferences. Traditional outlines, such as topic and sentence outlines, use a hierarchical structure with Roman numerals and letters to organize ideas by level of importance. This type of format is often used in academic writing and can be especially useful for long or complex papers.\nFaculty members and other instructors may require students to use a specific type of outline when writing papers or completing other assignments. It is important to follow any guidelines provided by your instructor and to make sure that your outline is well-organized and clearly presented.\nOutlines can also be a helpful tool for writers who are struggling to get started on a paper or who are having trouble organizing their ideas. By breaking down the writing process into smaller, more manageable steps, outlines can help writers overcome writer's block and improve the overall structure and coherence of their work.\nIt can be very helpful to outline your work, even if you're just beginning. Not only does it allow you to organize your work, but it can also help you get a clearer picture of your plot or paper and the general direction you want to go in.\nIn this article, we will explore the different types of outlining and how they can be used effectively for various writing and research projects. Outlining is also a powerful technical for high level project planning. At the end we'll also touch on an outliner software app that can be used to create and share outlines.\nWhat is Outlining?\nOutlining in the context of writing a novel or book is a method used to organize the story plot, characters and setting. This is a useful tool in many areas of writing, from nonfiction to fiction. An outline allows you to create a logical order and establish an appealing flow.\nIf you are writing a book, a good outline should include a few key elements, including a topic sentence, a list of scenes, a list of characters, a plot summary, and research notes. You should also leave room for scene purpose questions, which will reveal how you will use your characters and settings in the story.\nIf you are writing research paper then before you begin writing you should think about the assertion or conclusion you are working towards and structure your thinking and writing in an appropriate way to convey your case. The main objective is to summarize the most important points, citing relevant sources or quotes to back up your claims. You will likely have many sections.\nAn outline can be formal or informal. Some writers prefer to work free form, while others are better off with a more structured method. Most word-processing applications are equipped with an outlining feature which can also work as bullet points or in number format.\nTypes of Outline\nThere are several types of outlines, and each one has its advantages and disadvantages. The outlining process is a valuable pre-writing tool, but a poorly constructed outline can hinder the development of your story, paper or project.\nThe main goal of an outline is to present the most important elements of your subject. Before you begin outlining you might select different formats that help you organize your thoughts.\nA topic outline is a type of outline that organizes ideas by topic, rather than by order of importance or chronology. It is a useful tool for organizing research and writing projects that cover a wide range of topics. A topic outline allows writers to see the relationships between different ideas and can help them determine what information is relevant and what can be left out, and which are supporting ideas to the main ideas and major points.\nA sentence outline is a type of outline that consists of full sentences rather than just topic headings. This type of outline allows writers to see the relationships between different ideas more clearly and can be especially useful for longer or more complex projects. A sentence outline also helps writers ensure that their ideas are fully developed and that all of the necessary information is included.\nA concept map is a visual representation of the relationships between different ideas or concepts. It is often used in conjunction with other types of outlining to help writers see the connections between different ideas and to identify gaps in their research or writing. Concept maps can be especially useful for projects that involve a large amount of information or that cover a wide range of topics.\nA mind map is a visual representation of ideas and concepts that is organized around a central theme or idea. It is often used as a brainstorming tool to help writers generate ideas and to see the connections between different concepts. Mind maps can be especially useful for projects that involve a lot of creative thinking or for writers who prefer a more visual approach to organizing their ideas.\nOutlining an Essay or Research Paper\nOutlining an essay is a useful prewriting tool that helps writers organize ideas, keep their arguments focused on a single point, and determine the best appeals to make. It is an important step in writing a paper, and many professors will make it mandatory. But when you write an essay, you don't just need to outline; you also need to have a good thesis statement, evidence, and supporting details.\nWhen you outline your essay, you'll want to include the main point, or thesis statement, along with an introduction paragraph and a conclusion. The thesis statement should be a clear and concise statement of your primary argument, or point.\nAnother reason to include an outline is to help you keep track of what you've written. Having a template will keep your ideas organized, and will make it easy to revise and re-order your ideas.\nAn outline can also be helpful in making the process of writing an essay less daunting. For instance, it can remind you to make a transition between different points. This can be especially helpful for longer essays.\nWhile outlining an essay, you may want to include subheadings and headings. Headings represent the major ideas, while subheadings provide details that support those ideas. Using an outline can help you create a logical flow from point to point in your essay.\nIn terms of size, an outline can be anything from five to ten paragraphs. You may also wish to include an introduction, body, and conclusion.\nOutlining your Speech\nRegardless of what kind of speech you are giving, a good outline can be a valuable tool. It can help you visualize the subject matter of your speech and organize the information you want to discuss. Using an outline can also guide you through the speech.\nAn outline should contain main points and sub-points. In the final draft, the sub-points should be connected to the main point. The speaker should revise the outline several times before delivering it.\nA good presentation outline includes an Opening, Main Content, and Conclusion. This helps you structure your material and provides a sense of overall flow.\nAnother type of outline is a skeletal outline, which is used to prepare a speech. During the preparation of a speech, a writer should focus on finalizing the purpose of the speech and deciding where supporting material should be placed.\nWhen planning a speech, it is important to determine what is most interesting to the audience. Then, you should research the topic and identify major facets. After you have a list of ideas, write down the key phrases, definitions, stories, or analogies that relate to the topic.\nOutlining a Novel or Book\nOutlining a novel or book is a crucial part of the writing process. It can be easy to get stuck without an outline. A good outline will help you organize your thoughts before you begin.\nAn outline can be written on paper or in the form of a visual mind map. Creating an outline is a great way to plan your storyline and character development.\nA good book outline should include all of the main points of your story, as well as chapter summaries and character breakdowns. This way, you can see the big picture and sell your book to readers.\nAs you write, your outline will change. You can cut unimportant points or add new ones. In addition, you can plug in contents or make adjustments to your template. Once you have an outline, you'll have a solid foundation to work from. The outline will help you find gaps in logic or story. It will also help you avoid gaps in your plot.\nOne of the best ways to do this is to ask yourself questions on the page. You can use similar books as ideas, or you can ask yourself questions about unique angles.\nAnother great technique is to start by thinking of a premise. This premise is what will hook your potential readers, and it should answer the questions that a potential editor or agent might have.\nOutlining a Project\nIn the realm of planning and scheduling, the project outline is your ticket to success. It allows you to map out your tasks and visualize the distribution of effort. And if you're a project manager, this can help you nudge team members towards their responsibilities. Using a Gantt chart can also help.\nOf course, your project may vary in size and scope. Depending on the complexity of the project, it may not make sense to create an elaborate outline if the project is small. Fortunately, there are tools like NoteDex to make the task a breeze. This software makes it easy to outline project phases, stages and tasks right onto notecards, so you can spend less time managing your projects and more time making them happen.\nThe best part about simple tools like NoteDex is that you can easily add to or remove cards as you go, so you can keep your project plan up to date.\nOutlining an essay, book, research paper or project can be a good idea. It allows you to get a clear picture of the ideas you want to include and helps you organize them into a coherent piece.\nThere are many different types of outlining. Some examples include the editorialization, which uses anecdotes and commentary to make a point. You can also use a call to action, which helps your readers know what to do with what you have written.\nWhen outlining a paper, start with the introduction. The opening paragraph should be a short, eye-catching one that summarizes the topic and gets your reader's attention. Your next step is the body. Each body paragraph should list the key points of your paper. Be sure to include a thesis statement. The conclusion should tie together the ideas in your paper. For instance, you could describe how a research study helped fill a gap in the literature. In the same vein, you could describe how the study helped people understand the importance of the concept.\nIn a narrative essay, your conclusion should wrap up the story. Make sure to include some lessons learned and takeaways. Also, consider linking the conclusion to the introductory paragraph. This will create a full circle narration for your readers.\nLastly, don't forget to include a call to action in your conclusion. Including a call to action in your conclusion makes your work seem more genuine and gives the reader something to engage in next.\nIf you are interested in using an app to outline your thoughts try NoteDex - you can create 'index card' style short notecards that allow you to build out and organize your structure and thoughts.","metadata":{"date":1709128592000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947474715.58\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240228112121-20240228142121-00797.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9423962831,"token_count":2398,"url":"https:\/\/www.notedexapp.com\/blog\/the-different-types-of-outlining"},"score":4,"id":"135"}

What are the common culprits for muddy colors and which actions should we take in order to avoid them?\nSo vibrant, so fresh, so... tricky!\nMuddy colors are one of the most common struggles for people starting out with this painting medium and in today's blog post (and YouTube video!), I'm covering what they are exactly, so that you know what to keep an eye out for. I'll also be providing my best tips that'll help you keep your colors fresh and vibrant.\nThere's no doubt that watercolor is an amazing painting medium that can be a lot more practical to use when compared to mediums like acrylics or oils, which require a larger space to set up, a well-ventilated area, much more clean up and, most often than not, a larger investment in supplies.\nThis said, it doesn't take much time using watercolors to realize that they are truly a challenge.\nNot only are there so many variables involved when it comes to painting with watercolor that affect both the painting experience, as well as the final outcome (such as the humidity and temperature of the room we're in, the quality of our paint, each specific pigment's characteristics, the type of paper that we're using, etc.), but there's also no way to simply cover up our mistakes or swipe them off like we can when we're painting with opaque mediums.\nLearn more about different types of paint, paintbrushes and watercolor paper and what you truly need as a beginner just getting started in my blog post titled Watercolor Supplies for Beginners and Things You Must Know.\nNot to mention, we're working on a substrate that's inherently fragile. Even when we're working with paper that's intended for water-soluble mediums, it can only take so much scrubbing, lifting and layering. It's paper!\nIt's essential to stay patient, work mindfully, practice our water control and allow the paper to dry\/regain its strength whenever needed throughout the process.\nAs loose, expressive and even quick, more experienced artists make painting with watercolor seem, as I'll be talking about in the video, creating a successful piece requires not only mastering water control, but also knowledge of color, and going in with some sort of strategy.\nWe need to visualize the overall effects we're going for so that we know what techniques (wet-on-wet, wet-on-dry, etc.) to use where and also, when.\nIt's also essential to have some sort of general plan when it comes to the colors we'll be using.\nThen we can allow ourselves to let go and embrace the beautiful, organic effects that only watercolors allow.\nSo... what are muddy colors, exactly?\nThe term 'muddy color' refers to a color mixture or a section of our painting has turned dull, flat, matte and, overall, lifeless.\nMuddy colors lack the vibrancy (and most of the time also the translucency) that watercolor allows and don't look like they belong within the context of the piece, when one takes into consideration the rest of the colors used around that area.\nWatercolor allows for a light, interesting, vibrant use of color that's unique to this medium and flat, lifeless colors are often proof that something has gone wrong.\nThis said, it's important to note that a muddy color is very different from a desaturated or muted-out color.\nDesaturated colors are grays, browns or neutralized colors and these are often used intentionally by artists who are looking to tone down highly-saturated colors straight out of the pan or tube to make them look more realistic\/natural or simply to make use of a color scheme that suits their style best.\nYou'll notice that lots of colors (except for browns and neutrals) are very saturated and vibrant right out of the pan or tube, and these kinds of colors don't happen very much in real life when you look at the settings or living things around you.\nOther watercolor artists simply like the look of more muted out colors and create they own color mixtures, adding a second or even third color to desaturate them or create the color they need.\nThis doesn't make these colors mud, as long as the artist knows what he\/she is mixing together, has at least somewhat of a plan, is staying in control, is playing to the medium's translucent nature and interesting use of color, and the colors fit within the context of the piece.\nTake this still life watercolor of mine below as an example. I've created my own gray and brown color mixtures using Ultramarine Blue and Raw Umber and there's still a vibrancy\/life to them.\nThere's a variety in values, translucencies and even color temperature throughout these areas, and these more desaturated color mixtures harmonize and look like they've been planned. They allow the bright, vivid colors in the apples to shine.\n*Learn more about Art Fundamentals and what it takes to plan for successful, harmonious and balanced compositions with my classes over on Patreon.\nDesaturated, muted out colors and even grays and browns can, indeed, have a life and vibrancy to them, as long as we plan for them intentionally and make sure not to overwork our paintings.\nWhat's essential, in my opinion, is making use of this medium's translucency and dynamic nature to create light looking paintings with a vibrant use of color so that, whether the colors we're using are pure\/highly-saturated or toned-down, our paintings still seem to glow from within.\nMatte and opaque are opposite to translucent and vibrant.\nAnd flatness\/heaviness is basically where the problem is.\nNot darkness, not level of saturation.\nWhen we're just getting started with this medium and are still lacking water control, it's incredibly easy to overwork our paintings.\nAdd to this the fact that most beginnersdon't invest enough time to learn about the Color Wheel\/Color Theory and this is a recipe for lots of frustration and disappointment.\nIf you enjoyed this video and found it helpful, make sure to subscribe to my YouTube channel. I share a brand new video every week with art tips, drawing and painting tutorials and mindset\/productivity tips for artists. *Subscribe HERE*\nWhy do muddy colors happen?\nUsually, they happen because of one (or a combination) of the following:\na) Because we lose control of our different colors on our paint mixing palette or on our paper (colors can intermix in both areas).\nb) We don't know much about the Color Wheel\/Color Theory and don't pre-select our colors before starting a new piece (testing out color mixtures is very important).\nc) We don't clean out our paintbrush bristles well in-between colors and\/or we're not changing our water throughout the painting process.\nd) We're not staying patient and are getting anxious to finish, going over the same spot again and again, while our paper is still wet, in attempts to fix mistakes but damaging our paper in the process.\nFind a list of my favorite watercolor supplies here.\n10 Tips to Avoid Muddy Colors When Painting with Watercolor\n1. Learn about the Color Wheel and color temperature\nThe Color Wheel is an invaluable tool that helps us understand color relationships.\nNot only does it allow us to create color mixtures effectively while working, but it also enables us to plan color schemes prior to starting with the painting process that work beautifully and help us communicate the message we're looking to communicate.\nExperiment with creating your own color mixtures.

Learn about color and work on color mixing exercises outside of a painting process via color studies and explorations.\n2. Pre-select the colors you'll be using for the painting on hand before getting started\nRandomly picking colors throughout the painting process is a surefire way of arriving at muddy colors.\nKeeping things limited to only a certain amount of necessary colors, especially in the beginning, is a great idea. This not only allows the beginner to keep colors more organized throughout the process, but will mostly likely lead to an outcome that is much more harmonious and cohesive.\nIn this video, I share my entire process for painting a still life with watercolor using only 4 colors and why I love working with a limited color palette.\nBefore getting started with a new piece, give thought to how you're going to be creating the different colors you'll be needing, how you're going to be creating shadows and darker values of different colors, etc.\nMost often than not, working with a limited amount of colors is going to help you get comfortable with color mixing a lot faster!\n3. Change your water throughout the painting process (or use 2 or 3 containers)\nAs soon as you notice your water becoming murky, change it! You can also consider using 2 or even 3 containers as you're painting.\nThis way, you're able to use one of them to rinse out your bristles and another to take clean water from as needed throughout the process whenever you need to pre-wet areas of your paper, add more water to paint mixtures, soften out edges, etc.\n4. Make sure you're cleaning out your paintbrush bristles thoroughly in-between colors\nIf you just finished using one color and you're planning on going into a color that's very different from it, make extra sure that your bristles are well rinsed, especially if you're not looking to desaturate your colors.\nAs a rule of thumb, if I'm not going into an Analogous color (a color that is next to to the one I was just using the Color Wheel), or just finished using a brown\/neutral color, or even a color that might be more opaque than the one I want to use next (watercolors can be opaque, semi-opaque, translucent and semi-translucent), I make extra sure that all of the previous color has been washed out.\nUnless I actually want to desaturate or mute-out a color.\nIf you're using grays, browns or neutrals, or Complementary Colors (opposites in the Color Wheel) in your painting, make sure to stay mindful throughout the process, as it's very easy for colors to mix together on your paper (especially if you're using lots of wet-on-wet), in your paint-mixing palette, and even in the bristles of your paintbrush!\n5. Be careful when using Complementary Colors\nComplementary Colors are opposites in the Color Wheel and, when mixed together, they neutralize or mute each other out. You can use this to your advantage if this is what you want to do, but if your aim is to keep your colors super saturated, then you need to approach these color combos with some sort of strategy.\nAsk yourself: Depending on the effects that I'm going for, what area should I paint first, next and last? What techniques should I be using (wet-on-wet, wet-on-dry, etc.)? What areas should I stay extra mindful to allow to dry before adding more color on top or around it? Should I be placing these two colors next to each other at this point in the process?\nRemember that watercolor is always going to expand and bleed into paper that is wet. So if you don't want colors to intermix, you must allow them to dry completely.\nIf it makes sense for the subject on hand and the style you're going for, consider darkening colors with an Analogous Color, if you want colors to remain very vivid. Remember, Analogous Colors are next to each other in the Color Wheel.\n6. Avoid using ready-made blacks\nThough color ingredients vary from brand to brand, most ready-made blacks such as Lamp Black, Ivory Black, Mars Black, etc., tend to be very flat and usually dull-out colors. This is one of the reasons why so many traditionally trained watercolor artists don't use them and, instead, create their own dark color mixtures that have liveliness and a color temperature to them.\nIt's also important to have in mind that blacks can really lead to stark, heavy looking marks or shapes that can be very distracting, and that there's actually very little pure black in nature. Even shadows have color and a temperature to them.\nThere are tons of ways to create your own darks when using watercolor.\nI share many different dark color mixtures in this video over at my YouTube channel.\nIf you do use a ready-made black, consider adding another color into it.\nYou can also use Neutral Tint, Payne's Gray or Analogous Cours to darken a certain color.\n7. Hold yourself back from overworking your paintings\nThis is a tough one and something I'm working on as I continue on my journey with watercolor. Especially because I started painting with oils and acrylics, which usually require layering and going over the same area many times.\nWhen it comes to working with watercolor, I've realized that the less moving around of paint we do after its been placed and even the less amount of layers we have to develop, the better and the fresher the outcome tends to be.\nI've realized that visualizing the outcome we're after and approaching a new watercolor painting process with at least some sort of general plan is essential. This helps us lay down our washes and brush strokes more confidently and leave things be.\nBecause, if we don't know what we're after or what we're doing, we're going to be hesitating and making lots of mistakes that we'll want to go in and fix.\nMistakes and accidents always happen, but they're usually a lot smaller and can be made less noticeable more easily if we go in with a strategy and are staying mindful\/patient.\nIf you feel you need to practice a specific technique or do isolated studies of something before getting started with a more complete piece, do it! It'll help you attack a new painting a lot more confidently and with much more success.\nIf you make a mistake, don't fret. Simply absorb excess water and paint with your absorbent towel or semi-dry paintbrush bristles and allow it to dry. Come back after the paper has regained its strength to see how you can make it less noticeable.\n*A small amount of moving around of our paint is okay, but avoid going over the same spot again, and again, and again!*\n8. Allow your layers of paint to dry completely before applying another wash on top\nLike I said before, watercolor is always going to expand into paper that is wet. If the paper is very wet, the paint you place on top is going to expand more rapidly. If the paper is starting to dry, it'll expand more slowly.\nBut it'll always feather out at least a bit depending on the level of moisture.\nThere are varying degrees of wetness a paper can have when we're working with watercolor and, as we continue practicing, it'll become easier to tell when we should be dropping in our paint in order to achieve a certain level of gradating or blurring out.\nIf we want our marks or the edges of our shapes to be clean and sharp, or if we don't want the previous colors we've placed to intermix with the ones we want to place on top, it's important to be patient and allow our painting (or at least that specific area) to dry completely.\nAlways remember that, wet paper is fragile paper and we must allow it to regain its strength before attempting to add further detail or darken certain areas.\n9. Avoid using opaque colors\nWatercolor paint can be opaque, semi-opaque, transparent and semi-transparent. Each individual color's characteristics vary, even within the same paint set, and this is one of the reasons why swatching out a new paint set is important.\nIt's important to know that opaque colors tend to create color mixtures that get thicker and thicker, and murkier and murkier, which can lead to mud much more easily than using transparent colors.\nThis doesn't mean that we can't use them (I use them all the time!), but it does mean that we have to use them carefully or, in many cases, on their own.\nColors such as Cadmium Yellow, Cadmium Red, Cerulean Blue, Raw Umber and Yellow Ochre tend to have opaque qualities to them.\nYou can never go wrong with testing out the different color mixtures you're planning on using on a scrap piece of watercolor paper before actually using them in your painting.\n10. Make sure that you're cleaning out your paint mixing palette thoroughly and keep colors organized throughout the process\nThis one's related to keeping your water and paintbrushes clean, and I just thought I'd add it in because it can be especially helpful for beginners.\nWhen we're watching videos in which expert watercolor artists are using a huge watercolor palette with a bunch of different colors that seem to be intermixing and they are freely taking their colors as they're painting, it's important to realize that they:\na) Know the Color Wheel like the back of their hand\nb) Have mastered water control and know what to do to fix mistakes\nc) Most likely than not, they've pre-selected and organized the specific colors they know and love using to create their very own color palette\nWhen we're just getting started it can seem like we should be approaching our painting process in that same way, with a large amount of colors and with a palette that *seems to be* out of control.\nIt can be very frustrating when a beginner sees that, tries to replicate that, continues ending up with paintings that don't seem right, and has no idea what he\/she is doing wrong.\nLearn about Color Theory, keep things practical and limited, and stay as organized as possible in the beginning so that you can continue practicing mindfully and, I promise, you'll get to that point a lot sooner!\nHigher quality watercolor paint is going to lead to better results (better color payoff\/more vibrancy\/easier mixing of colors\/etc.) and generally offers more information about each color such as its level of translucency, granulation, etc. Cheaper watercolors tend to be chalky and opaque, which lead to muddy colors.\nFind a list of my favorite watercolor supplies here.\nis a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for sites\nto earn advertising fees by advertising and linking to amazon.com.\nis a participant in the Shareasale.com Affiliate Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for sites to earn advertising fees by advertising and linking to Shareasale.com partner companies.","metadata":{"date":1709051303000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947474676.79\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240227153053-20240227183053-00198.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9555422664,"token_count":4026,"url":"https:\/\/www.erikalancaster.com\/art-blog\/watercolor-painting-10-tips-to-avoid-muddy-colors"},"score":2,"id":"136"}
{"text":"18 Oct $14 million grant to drive clinical research at UW\nMadison, Wis. \u2014 The University of Wisconsin-Madison intends to train more clinical researchers, whose work is rising in prestige and importance in medical science, with the help of a $14 million, five-year grant from the National Institutes of Health.\nMolly Carnes, a professor with appointments in the medical and engineering schools who will oversee the training program, sees the funding as a boon to clinical research in general. Clinical studies have more variables and irregularities than traditional lab studies and have been seen as less desirable, she said.\n\u201cOver the past 20 years, the science of performing clinical research itself has evolved,\u201d Carnes said. \u201cIt is now widely accepted that if we are going to practice evidence-based medicine, we must have well-performed, scientifically sound, clinical research studies so that we have solid proof that the treatments, diagnostic tests, and preventive strategies that we do to our patients are truly beneficial.\u201d\nThe university responded to a competitive request for proposals from the NIH in 2003, said Jeanette Roberts, dean of the School of Pharmacy, where the program\u2019s administrative offices will be based. UW-Madison is one of seven sites given grants.\nAfter the grant\u2019s five-year term schools will again compete for funding. Roberts hopes UW-Madison\u2019s track record by that point will give it an advantage.\nFocusing on interdisciplinary research, the university\u2019s training program will bring together 72 university faculty from multiple departments, mostly nursing, medicine, pharmacy and engineering. Roberts said most trainees would be either young practicing clinicians without research backgrounds or advanced students aimed at faculty positions.\nInvolving different disciplines is what many researchers see as the way forward, as technological advances break down old academic boundaries. Pharmacy students, for example, can benefit from engineering knowledge about drug delivery devices, Roberts said.\n\u201cYou not only want your physician to be prescribing you medications that have been proven in clinical trials to be of benefit to you, you also want your physical therapist to be using treatments that have been similarly proven,\u201d Carnes said.\nThe private sector also employs clinical research, notably in biotechnology and biomedical fields that may involve required FDA trials, leading to more demand for researchers.\n\u201cIt really is a new way that the NIH has approached things,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cIt\u2019s a nationwide undertaking to train this new workforce.\u201d\nThe training will cover 10 subject areas: aging, asthma, cancer, heart disease, child and teen health, epilepsy, health-care technology and communication, nutrition, tobacco and alcohol intervention, women\u2019s health and underserved populations. The roadmap grant is meant to support up to 24 trainees by the third year.\n\u201cIt is the largest grant ever given by the NIH to support training in clinical research,\u201d Carnes said. \u201cAnd NIH money not only talks; it shouts.\u201d\nJason Stitt is WTN\u2019s associate editor and can be reached at email@example.com","metadata":{"date":1708768348000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947474526.76\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240224080616-20240224110616-00798.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9481314421,"token_count":645,"url":"https:\/\/wtnnews.com\/2004\/10\/18\/1265\/"},"score":2,"id":"137"}
{"text":"Trump Will Win by Giving Them Hell\nCommentary By Stephen Moore\nPresident Donald Trump isn't the first incumbent president to run for reelection facing a deficit in the late summer polls. At this stage of the election cycle in 1948, no one thought Democrat Harry Truman had a prayer of winning as he sank in the polls.\nNewsweek magazine likened the Truman campaign in the month before the election to a \"ship beating itself to pieces against a rocky shore.\"\nThe \"never Trumans\" in the Democratic party were not much different from the Republicans' never Trumpers, a group of neoconservatives who Trumpism has thrust into irrelevancy. In the election of 1948, Southern Democrats rallied around Dixiecrat and South Carolina Gov. Strom Thurmond, and Henry Wallace ran as a Progressive Party candidate.\nSo, how did Truman pull off the \"miracle of '48\"?\nIn the last three months of the campaign, he adopted an ingenious strategy of running against the \"do-nothing Republican Congress.\" He fled Washington by train on his \"whistle blow\" tour through the heartland. He pitted the social and financial concerns of blue-collar Americans, farmers and faith-based voters against the moneyed interests and deep-pocketed lobbyists on the East Coast. This, of course, led to the populist, \"Give 'em hell, Harry\" rallying cry of Middle America.\nHe warned voters that if they \"stay at home\" on Election Day, they would only \"keep these reactionaries in power\" and \"deserve every blow you get.\"\nTrump should borrow this strategy from Truman. There is no economic or political gain from swimming in the swamp and negotiating a \"fiscal stimulus\" bill with the Democrats that will be larded up with special interest spending.\nHe should campaign against House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's $3 trillion monstrosity of a \"stimulus\" bill containing goody bags, paid for by taxpayers, to every liberal special interest group imaginable. That bill stimulates nothing but Pelosi's contributor list -- from teachers unions to environmental lobbyists to trial lawyers to government workers. Americans are disgusted by the opportunism of Democrats -- that they would dare use a public health crisis to fund union pensions, the National Symphony Orchestra and environmental justice grants, whatever those are.\nTrump is the modern-day Truman against a lifetime politician and his running mate, another lifetime politician -- neither of whom have any business or job-creating experience. He could barnstorm around the country denouncing Democrat tax hikes and their obsession with issues such as climate change that would require strangling our energy industry. This would be cheered in China and Europe, but it would hobble America's Midwestern industrial base and put millions of miners, drillers, truckers, construction workers and other hard hats in unemployment lines.\nThe Democrats have been apologists for the rioters, gangs, looters and anarchists who have burned down inner-city neighborhoods, harming the very minorities they say they want to help. Trump could win the election as the candidate of public safety alone.\nThe most populist issue of all is to fully open the American economy in a safe and effective way to reduce unemployment and get American families a paycheck. Democrats have defined themselves as the lockdown party.\nTruman used to say: \"I didn't give them hell. I just told the truth, and they thought it was hell.\" Trump's special challenge is that, unlike Truman, he isn't just up against a corrupt East Coast elite core of deep-state, deep-pocketed lobbyists and the wealthy social snobs who view Middle America as flyover country. He also must combat the bleed-blue media.\nGiven how unpopular the media is today, he can even turn the bias and blinding hatred at places such as CNN from a liability into an asset by again running against the fake news industrial complex. All of this is to say that voters need to be reminded daily that the left doesn't just disdain Trump but also disdains the values and pro-America principles of Trump voters. Time to rile up the \"deplorables\" again, circa 1948 and 2016.\nStephen Moore is a senior fellow at the Heritage Foundation and an economic consultant with FreedomWorks.

{"text":"TREKKING | RIFUGIO VAZZOLER - BOTANICAL GARDEN \"A. SEGNI\" | ALLEGHE | DOLOMITES UNESCO World Natural Heritage Site\nThe start is in Listolade, a hamlet in the Community of Taibon Agordino that is 31 km regional road 203 Agordina, from where, veering right, you can take the car up for 4 Km along the Val Corpassa to the Capanna Trieste (1135 m). Proceed on foot along the old mule trail which after a brief tract goes in to a pine forest and continue in a counter clockwise direction to the Corpassa torrent where you cross on a narrow iron walkway. The mule trail continues with straight sections and sharp turns until you reach Capanna Ginetto, a tiny emergency shelter that is useful if the weather is bad; above there is the spectacular vertical wall of the Torre Trieste (the \u201ctower of all towers\u201d), the setting for popular alpine rock climbing feats. Continuing along the mule trail you get to Pi\u00e0n de le T\u00e0ie (here there is a fork in the path that to the right goes up to the Van de le Sasse and the ferrata Tissi cabled trail), you proceed admiring the Cima del Banc\u00f3n, the Cantoni di Pelsa and the superb Torre Venezia with its summit pinnacle and in about twenty minutes you make it to the Rifugio Vazzol\u00e8r (1714 m), built by the CAI association from Conegliano in 1929. In 1968 this same CAI group set up a botanical garden adjacent to this lodge, which is now managed by the Belluno Regional Forestry Office. The garden covers a surface area of about 5000 square metres where a network of paths leads one to admire the various floral species indicated by specific signs. A must is a brief rest at the small chapel that lies to the right of the lodge, on a tiny hill, where there are two marble slated carved with the names of all those Alpinists who have perished on the Civetta. If you lengthen the route a little, towards the base of the Torre Venezia in the direction of the Rifugio Tissi, after about 20 minutes in a marvellous, stony atmosphere you will be awed when you meet an image of Christ built to scale in iron wire on the wall of a massif to the right of the path. The return follows the same route back and takes about an hour and a half.","metadata":{"date":1709490877000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947476397.24\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240303174631-20240303204631-00897.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.8980876207,"token_count":543,"url":"https:\/\/www.dolomiti.org\/en\/alleghe\/experiences\/trekking\/trekking-rifugio-vazzoler-botanic-garden?type=excursions"},"score":2,"id":"139"}
{"text":"Days 4 and 5 - Thursday and Friday\nMy only scheduled session on Thursday started at 2pm, so I didn\u2019t go into Uni until I\u2019d made sure that I had a good lunch. The session was a practical for Distributed Systems, although no task was set, only to work on the assessment due the next day. Some had nearly finished, some had finished and some had hardly started.\nOur group project normally meets on a Friday morning, but we had already agreed that this would be moved to Monday due to the deadline.\nWe all worked on the assessment, helping each other out as we came across problems and then playing each others games as they got to the point where they were playable. The best games, in my opinion, where the ones with the best story lines. There were some really creative ones that I really would have liked to see expanded on. It\u2019s a shame that after students complete assessments they are rarely ever looked at again and the code is usually lost.\nBy around 9pm, I was starting to feel hungry and ordered a Dominos pizza to the University. We do this often enough that the drivers know where to find our building, but will typically not leave their car so we have to walk to collect it. Still, it\u2019s an easy way to eat food when you don\u2019t have time to walk all the way to a takeaway.\nBy 11pm I had completed the vast majority of the code. The students that remained in the room were nearing the same stage although most had finished and gone home already. I took a break at this point and played Minecraft for an hour.\nAfter my break, I finished off the remaining parts of the code and let a few people play it. They were unable to find any bugs and I declared it complete. As I had no scheduled sessions on the Friday (it was Friday by this point), after submitting the assessment I stayed to help anyone that had any problems and to help them test their games.\nThe University has strict guidelines on plagiarism and sometimes it\u2019s hard to draw the line between helping someone reach a solution and simply handing them a solution. My rule of thumb is that I never touch their keyboard or just dictate code. As long as I avoid those two things, they have arrived at the solution themselves.\nBy 4am, everyone was done. One student took a taxi home, the rest of us walked. Now the reason why this post has both Thursday and Friday combined: Friday really didn\u2019t happen. I slept through the whole day, happy in the knowledge that I had completed the assessment well and did not have to do anything.\nThis weekend will be spent putting my sleep pattern back to normal for Monday, where the whole thing starts again.","metadata":{"date":1708571812000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947473690.28\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240222030017-20240222060017-00199.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9909063578,"token_count":567,"url":"https:\/\/irl.xyz\/blog\/2012\/2012w125\/"},"score":1,"id":"140"}

Consider the Speed\nAnother important factor to consider when choosing a telescope is the speed of the optics.\nThe speed of the optics is indicated by the \"f-number\" (for example, f\/4, f\/5, or f\/6).\nThe lower the f-number, the faster the telescope. For instance, an f\/4 telescope is faster than an f\/5 telescope.\n3. Look at the Aperture\nThe aperture is the diameter of the main lens or mirror in a telescope.\nIt's important to choose a telescope with a large aperture because this allows more light into the instrument, which results in brighter images.\nIf you're interested in observing distant galaxies and nebulae, look for a telescope with an aperture of 8 inches or more.\nFor planetary observations, an aperture of 4 inches should be sufficient.\n4. Consider Portability\nOne final factor that you'll need to take into account when choosing a telescope is portability.\nIf you plan on doing a lot of travel observing, then you'll want to choose a small telescope that can easily be packed up and transported.\nHowever, if portability isn't a major concern for you, then you can opt for a larger telescope that will provide better performance but may be more difficult to transport from place to place.\n5. Setting Up Your Telescope\nOnce you've selected the perfect telescope for your family, it's time to set it up!\nFirst, find a level spot outdoors where you'll be able to set up your tripod (if your model doesn't come with one).\nMake sure that there are no trees or buildings nearby that could obstruct your view. Next, assemble your telescope according to the instructions that came with it.\nOnce everything is assembled, point your telescope towards an open area of sky and start exploring!\nThere are so many different types and models of telescopes on the market today that choosing the right one for your family can feel like a daunting task!\nBut by following these simple guidelines\u2014deciding what you want to see; considering the speed; looking at the aperture, and thinking about portability\u2014you'll be sure to find the perfect match for your family's stargazing needs!\nAnd remember: once you have your new telescope set up, make sure to point it towards an open area of the sky so that you can start exploring the universe!\nIf you're looking for the best telescopes for kids, look no further!\nWe've gathered a great selection of telescopes perfect for young astronomers.\nClick the link below to browse our selection, and find the perfect telescope for your little scientist!","metadata":{"date":1708718676000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947474445.77\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240223185223-20240223215223-00398.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9292168617,"token_count":718,"url":"https:\/\/www.nutmegsnook.com\/how-to-choose-a-telescope-for-your-family\/"},"score":3,"id":"143"}
{"text":"POSTED BY: DEAN JAMES\nDHS Bars Democrat Staffers From Visiting Border Facilities Over Their \u2018Rude\u2019 And \u2018Disruptive\u2019 Behavior\n(NationalSentinel) Fed up with the \u201crude\u201d and \u201cdisruptive\u201d behavior of staffers for Democrat lawmakers, the Department of Homeland Security has barred them from visiting border facilities, Fox News reports.\nSpecifically, the report said, DHS has banned staffers from the House Oversight Committee, which is chaired by Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), from visiting Customs and Border Protection facilities along the southwest border with Mexico as they were planning a trip this week because the last time they visited they were \u201cdisruptive\u201d and would not follow agents\u2019 instructions.\n\u2026[S]ources told Fox News that DHS has revoked access to CBP facilities for the upcoming visit, citing staff behavior that \u201cinterfered\u201d with law enforcement operations \u2014 including refusing to leave one site after their scheduled window, skipping some tours and being \u201crude\u201d to officers. A DHS official said that ICE visits will still be allowed this week, but with a two-hour time limit. One of those visits took place on Tuesday.\n\u201cDue to the operational burden placed on the field by their refusal to comply with instruction during last week\u2019s STAFFDEL [staff delegation visit], CBP pulled the trip in which more site visits were to take place at CBP and ICE facilities this week,\u201d a senior DHS official told Fox News in an email Wednesday.\n\u201cDHS communicated to the committee that due to their conduct, CBP could not support visits from the committee this week.\u201d\nOne Democratic source suggested to the network that DHS cancelled the visit because of what staffers were seeing in the facilities, but DHS rejected that noting that facilities are well-run, if crowded and busy, and migrants detained there are taken care of.\nFor instance, last week after a visit to one of the first facilities on the committee staff\u2019s scheduled, DHS Assistance Secretary of Legislative Affairs Christine Ciccone wrote to Cummings to inform him that because of his staff\u2019s violations of guidelines, their planned return trip would not be permitted.\nIt seems that Democratic staffers are more interested in creating scenes and politicizing their visits than actually learning about what\u2019s really going on.\n\u201cDuring discussions between Department and Committee staff, however, the Committee staff repeatedly stated that they do not intend to abide by DHS guidelines,\u201d Ciccone wrote in the letter obtained by Fox News.\n\u201cIn light of this, we are unable to accommodate your staff\u2019s visit \u2026 unless we receive a firm commitment that the Committee and its staff will comply fully with all existing guidelines and policies.\u201d (Related: U.S. Border Patrol chief to Congress: \u2018Humanitarian AND security crisis\u2019 exists along U.S. border (Video)\nShe noted further that the staff\u2019s attempts to \u201cconduct interviews and take photographs\u201d without limitations are \u201ca significant deviation\u201d from DHS policy and \u201ccould jeopardize\u201d the department\u2019s ability to meet legal obligations.\nThe evening before last week\u2019s visit, DHS officials said they had a \u201clate-night\u201d phone conversation with committee staff in which they were urged to \u201crespect officers on the ground\u201d and to not \u201cdisrupt business\u201d at facilities.\nAnd yet, according to a CBP official, the committee\u2019s chief counsel, who led the delegation which began in Yuma, Ariz., \u201crefused to leave the facility after the hour-long tour,\u201d despite agreeing to a 45-minute tour at each location.\nIn addition, Committee Ranking Member Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) said in a letter to Cummings that Democratic staff actually crossed into Mexico \u201cwithout consultation from the Department of State.\u201d He added the Democratic staff was \u201crude\u201d and \u201cdismissive\u201d of law enforcement officials during the visit.\n\u201cOne aspect missing from your staff travel to date has been any interest in the well-being of, or resources provided to, the brave men and women who serve to secure our border,\u201d Jordan added. \u201cSeveral Border Patrol agents told us the nasty rhetoric from Democrats in Congress\u2014one Member of this committee even likened them to Nazis \u2014 hurts morale and makes some agents reluctant to tell people what they do for a living.\u201d\nRep. Jordan was referring to was Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., who has referred to border facilities as \u201cconcentration camps on the Southern Border.\u201d\nLet us know what you think about this in the comments below!\nJoin us at SPREELY if you want REAL NEWS without the leftist censorship!\nDean James at Right Wing Tribune\nDemocrats Border War:\n- BUSTED!!!

{"text":"Betula populifolia (gray or grey birch) is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America.\nIt ranges from southeastern Ontario east to Nova Scotia, and south to Pennsylvania and New Jersey, with disjunct populations in Indiana, Virginia, and North Carolina. It prefers poor, dry upland soils, but is also found in moist mixed woodlands. Living only about 30 years, it is a common pioneer species on abandoned fields and burned areas.\nBetula populifolia, commonly called gray birch, is a short-lived, narrow-columnar, suckering, deciduous tree that typically grows to 20-40\u2019 tall. It most often appears in a multi-trunked form, but also grows with a single trunk. It is native primarily from Southeastern Canada to Virginia, with a scattering of plants extending westward to Illinois. It typically occurs in both dry and wet soils. This tree is noted for (1) its non-peeling chalky white bark with dark chevron trunk patches appearing below each branch base and (2) its long-pointed triangular green leaves. Triangular leaves (each to 3\u201d long) are double-toothed and shiny with tapered tips. Fall color is usually undistinguished. Tiny monoecious flowers appear in early spring in separate catkins on the same tree: yellowish-brown male flowers in single catkins (to 4\u201d long) at the branch tips and greenish female flowers in smaller, upright catkins (to 1\/2\u201d long). Female flowers are followed by drooping cone-like fruits containing numerous small winged seeds that typically mature in late summer. Plants have rough-warty twigs.\nGenus name is the Latin name for birch.\nSpecific epithet come from the Latin populus meaning poplar genus and folia meaning leaves like those of the poplar.Species name comes from Populus (poplar genus) and Latin folia (leaf) in reference to leaf appearance.","metadata":{"date":1708646030000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947473871.23\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240222225655-20240223015655-00799.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9527118802,"token_count":419,"url":"https:\/\/myplantin.com\/plant\/5099"},"score":4,"id":"145"}

{"text":"Engaging 50 word intro\nHave you ever wondered about the difference between advice and suggestion? Although they may seem similar, there are distinct variations between the two. In this article, we will explore the definitions, examples, and uses of both advice and suggestion. Additionally, we will provide a detailed table highlighting ten key differences that will help you understand when and how to use each. Let\u2019s dive in!\nWhat is Advice?\nAdvice refers to recommendations or opinions given to someone to guide them in making decisions or solving a problem. It is based on the expertise and experience of the person providing the advice. Advice can be given in various contexts, such as personal relationships, professional settings, or specific situations.\nExamples of Advice:\n\u2013 \u201cYou should consider studying more to improve your grades.\u201d\n\u2013 \u201cI suggest saving some money each month for emergencies.\u201d\n\u2013 \u201cIt would be wise to consult with a lawyer before making any legal decisions.\u201d\nUses of Advice:\n\u2013 To provide guidance or direction to someone facing a decision or problem.\n\u2013 To share expertise or knowledge with others.\n\u2013 To offer support or assistance in achieving certain goals.\n\u2013 To provide caution or warn against potential risks.\nWhat is a Suggestion?\nA suggestion, on the other hand, is an idea or proposal put forward for consideration or action. It is usually offered with the intention of helping or improving a situation. Unlike advice, suggestions may not be based on personal expertise or experience but are often the result of creative thinking or brainstorming.\nExamples of Suggestions:\n\u2013 \u201cYou might want to try studying in a quiet environment to improve your concentration.\u201d\n\u2013 \u201cHow about setting up an automatic savings plan to save money regularly?\u201d\n\u2013 \u201cWhy don\u2019t you get a second opinion from another lawyer before making any legal decisions?\u201d\nUses of Suggestions:\n\u2013 To propose alternative ideas or approaches.\n\u2013 To encourage creativity and explore new possibilities.\n\u2013 To provide options or alternatives for consideration.\n\u2013 To stimulate discussion or brainstorming sessions.\nDifferences between Advice and Suggestion:\n|Based on personal expertise and experience.\n|May or may not be based on personal expertise.\n|Often more authoritative or assertive.\n|Usually more gentle or tentative.\n|Guides decision-making process.\n|Offers alternative ideas or options.\n|Suggests solutions or ways to overcome obstacles.\n|Proposes ideas or approaches for consideration.\n|Based on the advisor\u2019s knowledge and experience.\n|Can be based on personal opinion or creative thinking.\n|Often specific and targeted.\n|Can be broad and open-ended.\n|May carry more weight due to expertise.\n|Relies on persuasiveness and reasoning.\n|May allow less room for interpretation or modification.\n|Can be more adaptable or subject to interpretation.\n|Often direct and to the point.\n|Can be framed as gentle recommendations or ideas.\n|Frequently provided in professional or mentorship roles.\n|Common in creative or collaborative contexts.\nIn conclusion, while advice and suggestion may seem similar, they have distinct differences. Advice is based on the advisor\u2019s experience and expertise, often guiding decision-making and problem-solving. On the other hand, suggestions are proposals or ideas provided for consideration, encouraging creativity and exploring alternatives. Understanding these differences will help you effectively navigate various situations and choose the most appropriate course of action.\nPeople Also Ask:\n1. What is the main difference between advice and suggestion?\nThe main difference lies in the source and purpose. Advice is based on personal expertise and aims to guide decision-making or problem-solving, while suggestions are ideas or proposals put forward for consideration or action.\n2. How do advice and suggestions influence decision-making?\nAdvice guides decision-making by drawing on the advisor\u2019s knowledge and experience, providing recommendations or solutions. Suggestions offer alternative ideas or approaches, expanding possibilities and stimulating discussion.\n3. Can suggestions be more persuasive than advice?\nWhile suggestions may not necessarily carry the weight of expertise, they can still be persuasive through effective reasoning, creative thinking, and presenting compelling alternatives.\n4. In which contexts are advice and suggestions commonly used?\nAdvice is often provided in professional or mentorship roles, such as career guidance or personal development. Suggestions, on the other hand, are common in creative or collaborative contexts, where brainstorming or exploring possibilities is encouraged.\n5. When should I seek advice and when should I consider suggestions?\nSeek advice when you require expertise, knowledge, or guidance in making a decision or solving a problem. Consider suggestions when you want to explore alternative ideas, options, or possibilities beyond the conventional approach.","metadata":{"date":1709137778000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947474737.17\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240228143955-20240228173955-00897.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9124922752,"token_count":1001,"url":"https:\/\/diferr.com\/difference-between-advice-and-suggestion\/"},"score":4,"id":"147"}

{"text":"If year-end fatigue is getting too real, consider this a daily reminder to go easy on yourself. Around this time of year, puffy eyes and dark circles become far too regular. Whether induced by a lack of sleep or a work-related cry sesh (we\u2019ve been there ), these SOS remedies are amazing for de-puffing eyes in an instant!\n1. A cold compression\nThis is the quickest way to zap away puffy under eyes. All you need to do is soak a clean face cloth in cold water, then fold it into a square and press it against the eye area for a couple of minutes.\nFYI: A cold compress works wonders for puffiness as cool objects instantly constrict blood vessels, which, in turn, reduces inflammation and tightens the area, leaving the eyes looking refreshed and more awake.\n2. Cool spoons or tea bags\nAnother alternative is to freeze two teaspoons in your freezer overnight and apply them to the under eyes. And if you want to energise the area further, opt for cold tea bags. Green, black and white teas contain high amounts of caffeine, antioxidants and anti-inflammatory properties to soothe and reduce swelling and dark circles.\n3. Caffeinated eye treatments\nLook for eye gels or creams infused with caffeine or black and green tea, like this L\u2019Or\u00e9al Paris Age Perfect Cell Renew Illuminating Eye Cream. Not only does caffeine deliver incredible antioxidant and anti-inflammatory perks, but it\u2019s also a vasoconstrictor, so it helps shrink blood vessels and lessen the look of \u201cbags.\u201d\n4. Lymphatic drainage\nYou can\u2019t go wrong with a little under-eye massage to drain any built-up fluid in the eye area. We love to incorporate a jade roller or eye roller into our routine every other day (like this My Clarins Re-Fresh Roll-On Eye De-Puffer), but make sure not to tug, pull or rub your skin while doing so, as this can catalyse wrinkling and discolouration, which we don\u2019t want!\n5.

{"text":"\"Lenin was prepared for his struggle on an international scale not only by his profound knowledge of Marxism and his experience of the revolutionary party organization in Russia, but also by his intimate acquaintance with the workers\u2019 movement throughout the world.\"\nPublished by The Encyclopedia Britannica (Fourteenth Edition 1939), Vol.13 (of 24), pages 911-914.\nThe Fourteenth Edition was apparently first printed in 1929 and reprinted in 1932, 1936, 1937, 1938, and 1939.\nTranscribed by Jim Gilbert for the Leon Trotsky Internet Archive.\nLENIN, VLADIMIR ILYICH ULYANOV (1870-1924), founder and guiding spirit of the Soviet Republics and the Communist International, the disciple of Marx, the leader of the Bolshevik party and the organizer of the Oct. revolution in Russia, was born on April 9 (22), 1870, in the town of Simbirsk, now Ulyanovsk. His father, Ilya Nicolaevitch, was a schoolmaster. His mother, Maria Alexandrovna, was the daughter of a doctor named Berg. His eldest brother (b. 1866) joined the \u201cNarodovoltze\u201d (a revolutionary terrorist society), and taking part in the unsuccessful attempt on the life of Alexander III., was executed (1891); this was a determining factor in Lenin\u2019s life.\nEarly Life. \u2013 The third of a family of six, Lenin completed his course at the Simbirsk gymnasium in 1887, winning the gold medal. He entered the Kazan University to study law, but was sent down in Dec. of the same year for taking part in a gathering of students and was banished to the country. It was not till the autumn of 1889 that he was allowed to return to Kazan, where he began the systematic study of Marx and met the members of the local Marxist circle. In 1891 Lenin passed the law examinations of the St. Petersburg University, and in 1892 he began to practise as a barrister at Samara, appearing for the defence in several trials. His life, however, was chiefly filled by the study of Marxism and its application to the economic and political development of Russia and subsequently of the whole world.\nIn 1894 he moved to St. Petersburg, and began his propaganda work. To this period belong Lenin\u2019s first polemical writings directed against the popular party and passed from hand to hand in manuscript form. Soon after, Lenin started in the Press a theoretical struggle against the falsifiers of Marx. In April 1895 he first went abroad to meet Plekhanov, Zasulich, Axelrod and the Marxist group known as the \u201cOsvobozhdenie Truda\u201d (Deliverance of Labour). On his return to St. Petersburg, he organized the illegal \u201cUnion for the Liberation of the Working Class,\u201d which rapidly became an important organization, carrying on propaganda among the workers. In Dec. 1895 Lenin and his closest collaborators were arrested. He spent the year 1896 in prison, and in Feb. 1897 he was exiled for three years to the Yenisei province in eastern Siberia. In 1898 he married N.K. Krupskaya, a comrade in the St. Petersburg Union and his faithful companion for the remaining 26 years of his life. During his exile he finished his most important economic work, The Development of Capitalism in Russia, based on an enormous mass of statistical material (1899). In 1900 Lenin went to Switzerland to arrange, with the \u201cDeliverance of Labour\u201d group, the publication of a revolutionary paper intended for Russia. At the end of the year the first number of the paper Iskra (The Spark) appeared in Munich, with the motto \u201cFrom Spark to Flame.\u201d Its aim was to give a Marxian interpretation of the problems of the revolution, with the political watchwords of the struggle, and to form a centralized \u201cunderground\u201d revolutionary party of Social Democrats, which, standing at the head of the proletariat, should open the struggle against Tsarism. The idea of an organized party leadership of the struggle of the proletariat in all its forms and manifestations, which is one of the central ideas of Leninism, is closely connected with the idea of the hegemony of the working class within the democratic movement of the country. This idea found direct expression in the programme of the dictatorship of the proletariat when the development of the revolutionary movement had prepared the conditions for the Oct. revolution.\nBolsheviks and Mensheviks. \u2013 The second Congress of the R.S.D.R.P. (Brussels, London) in July and Aug. 1903 accepted the programme worked out by Plekhanov and Lenin, but ended with the historic split of the party into Bolsheviks and Mensheviks. Thereupon Lenin entered on his separate path as leader of the Bolshevik section, later the Bolshevik party. The differences concerned tactics and finally the party programme. The Mensheviks tried to bring the policy of the Russian proletariat into line with that of the liberal bourgeoisie. Lenin saw in the peasantry the closest ally of the proletariat. Occasional agreements and closer relations with the Mensheviks failed to arrest the constant widening of the two lines \u2013 the revolutionary and the opportunist \u2013 the proletarian and the bourgeois. The struggle with the Mensheviks forged the policy which led to the break with the Second International (1914), to the Oct. revolution (1917) and to the change of the party\u2019s name from Social Democrat to Communist (1918).\nA revolutionary situation was created in the country by the defeat of the army and navy in the Russo-Japanese War, the shooting of the workers on Jan. 9 (22) in 1905, by agrarian disturbances and political strikes. Lenin\u2019s programme was the preparation of an armed rising of the masses against Tsarism, and the creation of a provisional Government to organize the revolutionary democratic dictatorship of the workmen and peasants for the deliverance of the country from Tsarism and serfdom. The third congress of the party, consisting exclusively of Bolsheviks (May 1905), passed a new agrarian programme which included the confiscation of the domains of landowners. In Oct. 1905 the All-Russian strike began. On the 17th of the month the Tsar issued his manifesto about the \u201cConstitution.\u201d In the beginning of Nov. Lenin returned to Russia from Geneva, and appealed to the Bolsheviks to bring into the party wider circles of workers, but to retain their illegal apparatus in anticipation of counter-revolutionary blows.\nIn the events of 1905 Lenin distinguished three main features \u2013 (1) the temporary seizure by the people of real political freedom, (2) the creation of new if only potential revolutionary power in the shape of soviets of workers\u2019, soldiers\u2019 and peasants\u2019 deputies; (3) the use of force by the people against those who had employed it against them. Those conclusions, from the events of 1905, became the guiding principles of Lenin\u2019s policy in 1917 and led to the dictatorship of the proletariat in the form of the Soviet State.\nThe rising in Moscow at the end of Dec., lacking as it did the support of the army, without simultaneous risings in other towns and sufficient response in the country districts, was quickly suppressed. The Liberal bourgeoisie came to the front. The epoch of the first two Dumas began. At this time, Lenin formulated the principles of the revolutionary exploitation of parliamentary methods as a means of fresh attack. In Dec. 1907 Lenin left Russia, to return only in 1917. Now (in 1907) began the epoch of victorious counter-revolution, prosecutions, exile, executions and emigration. Lenin led the struggle against the Mensheviks, the advocates of the liquidation of the \u201cunderground\u201d party \u2013 hence those known as \u201cliquidators\u201d \u2013 and of the change of their methods into legal ones within the framework of the existing regime; against the \u201cconciliators\u201d who tried to take up an intermediate position between Bolshevism and Menshevism \u2013 against the Socialist Revolutionaries who tried to make up for the inertia of the masses by personal terrorism; finally, against those Bolsheviks, the so-called \u201ccallers-off,\u201d who demanded the recall of the Social Democratic deputies from the Duma in the name of immediate revolutionary activity.\nAt the same time, Lenin carried on an extensive campaign against the attempt to revise the theoretic basis of Marxism on which his whole policy was founded. In 1908 he wrote a major treatise directed against the essentially idealistic philosophy of Mach, Avenarius and their Russian followers, who tried to unite empiric criticism with Marxism. Lenin proved that the methods of dialectical materialism as formulated by Marx and Engels were confirmed by the development of scientific thought in general and natural science in particular. Thus Lenin\u2019s constant revolutionary struggle went hand in hand with his theoretical controversies.\nThe years 1912-14 were marked in Russia by a fresh outburst of activity in the workers\u2019 movement. Breaches made their appearance in the counter-revolutionary regime. At the beginning of 1912 Lenin summoned a secret conference of the Russian Bolshevik organizations in Prague. The \u201cliquidators\u201d were declared to be outside the party. The split with the Mensheviks became final. A new central committee was elected. Lenin organized from abroad the publication in St. Petersburg of a legal newspaper, Pravda , which in its constant conflict with the censorship and the police exercised a guiding influence on the vanguard of the working class. In July 1912 Lenin, together with his closed colleagues, moved from Paris to Krakow in order to be in closer touch. The revolutionary movement in Russia was growing, and was thereby giving the Bolsheviks the preponderance. Lenin sent articles under different pseudonyms almost every day to the Bolshevik legal newspapers, drawing the inevitable inferences from them in the illegal (\u201cunderground\u201d) Press. At this time, as well as before and after it, N.K. Krupskaya was the centre of the organizing work. She received comrades from Russia, gave instructions to others on their way there, set up \u201cunderground\u201d connections, wrote, coded and decoded letters. It was in the small town of Poronin in Galicia that the declaration of war found Lenin. The Austrian police suspected him of being a Russian spy and arrested him; he was, after a fortnight, expelled to Switzerland.\nInternationalism. \u2013 A new and international phase of Lenin\u2019s work now opened. His manifesto, published in the name of the party on Nov. 1, 1914, denounced the imperialistic character of the War and the war guilt of all the great powers, who had long been preparing a sanguinary struggle for the purpose of widening their markets and destroying their rivals. The patriotic agitation of the bourgeoisie on both sides, who threw the blame each upon the other, was shown to be a maneuver to deceive the workers. The manifesto points out that the majority of Social Democratic leaders were on the side of the bourgeoisie of their own country, thus violating the resolutions of the International Socialist congresses and bringing about the downfall of the Second International. The defeat of their \u201cown\u201d governments should be the slogan of the Social Democrats of all countries. Lenin subjects to a merciless criticism not only Socialist patriotism, but that pacifism which, while occupied with platonic protests, withdraws from the revolutionary struggle with imperialism. The struggle with pacifism develops into a great struggle with those elements of the working class movement which are midway between the Social Democrats and the Communists, supporting the former in actual practice.\nThe theorists and politicians of the Second International redoubled the accusations of anarchism which they had before brought against Lenin. As a matter of fact, all Lenin\u2019s work was characterized by a twofold struggle, on the one hand with reformism which from the beginning of the War gave its support to the imperialist policy of the propertied classes, and on the other hand with anarchism and all the different varieties of revolutionary adventurists.\nOn Nov. 1, 1914 Lenin promulgated a programme for the creation of a new International \u201cto undertake the task of organizing the forces of the proletariat for the revolutionary attack on capitalist governments, for the civil war against the bourgeoisie of all countries, for the attainment of political power and the victory of Socialism.\u201d\nIn Sept. 1915 (Sept. 5 and 8) there was held at Zimmerwald in Switzerland the first conference of European Socialists who were opposed to the imperialistic war. Thirty-one delegates were present. The left wing of the Zimmerwald conference and of the later one at Kiental adopted Lenin\u2019s demand for the transformation of the imperialist war into a civil war, and became the nucleus of the future Communist International. The latter worked out its programme, tactics and organization under Lenin\u2019s guidance, and it was he who directly inspired the decisions of the first four congresses of the Communist International.\nLenin was prepared for his struggle on an international scale not only by his profound knowledge of Marxism and his experience of the revolutionary party organization in Russia, but also by his intimate acquaintance with the workers\u2019 movement throughout the world. He was master of the English, German and French languages, and could read Italian, Swedish and Polish. He was firmly opposed to the mechanical application of the methods of one country to another, and he investigated and decided questions concerning revolutionary movements, not only in their international reactions, but also in their concrete national form.\nRevolution of 1917. \u2013 The revolution of Feb. 1917 found Lenin in Switzerland. His attempts to reach Russia met with the opposition of the British Government, and he decided to travel through Germany. The success of this plan gave occasion to Lenin\u2019s enemies for a fierce campaign of slander, which, however, was powerless to prevent him from assuming the leadership of his party and shortly afterwards of the revolution.\nOn the night of April 4, on leaving the train, Lenin made a speech in the Finlyandsky station in Petrograd. He repeated and developed the leading ideas it contained in the days which followed. The overthrow of Tsarism, he said, was only the first stage in the revolution. The bourgeois revolution could no longer satisfy the masses. The task of the proletariat was to arm, to strengthen the power of the Soviets, to rouse the country districts and to prepare for the conquest of supreme power in the name of the reconstruction of society on a Socialist basis.\nThis far-reaching programme was not only unwelcome to those engaged in propagating patriotic Socialism, but even roused opposition among the Bolsheviks themselves. Plekhanov called Lenin\u2019s programme \u201ccrazy.\u201d Lenin, however, foresaw that the distrust of the bourgeoisie and of the Provisional Government would grow stronger daily, that the Bolshevik party would obtain a majority in the Soviets and that the supreme power would pass into their hands. The small daily Pravda became at once in his hands a powerful instrument for the overthrow of bourgeois society.\nThe policy of coalition with the bourgeoisie pursued by the patriotic Socialists, and the hopeless attack which the Allies forced the Russian Army to assume at the front roused the masses and led to armed demonstrations in Petrograd in the first days of July. The struggle against Bolshevism became intense. On July 5th forged \u201cdocuments\u201d were published by the counter-revolutionary secret service, purporting to prove that Lenin was acting under the orders of the German general staff. In the evening \u201creliable\u201d detachments summoned from the front by Kerensky and Cadet officers from the districts around Petrograd occupied the city. The popular movement was crushed. The hounding of Lenin reached its height. He now began to work \u201cunderground,\u201d hiding first in Petrograd with a worker\u2019s family and then in Finland.\nThe July days and the retributions which followed aroused a burst of energy in the masses. The Bolsheviks obtained a majority in the Soviets of Petrograd and Moscow. Lenin demanded decisive action to seize the supreme power. \u201cNow or never!\u201d he repeated in passionate articles, letters and interviews.\nThe Soviet of People\u2019s Commissaries. \u2013 The rising against the Provisional Government coincided with the opening of the second Congress of the Soviets on Oct. 25. Lenin, after being in hiding for three and a half months, appeared in the Smolny Institute and directed the fight. In the night sitting of Oct. 27 he proposed a draft decree about peace which was passed unanimously and another about the land, which was passed with one dissentient and eight abstentions. The Bolshevik majority, supported by the left wing of the Socialist Revolutionaries, declared that supreme power was now vested in the Soviets. The Soviet of People\u2019s Commissaries was appointed, with Lenin at the head.\nHaving obtained the land of the estate owners, the peasants supported the Bolsheviks. The Soviets became masters of the situation. The constituent assembly which was elected in Nov. and met on Jan. 5 was an anachronism. The conflict between the two stages of the revolution was at hand. Lenin did not hesitate for an instant. On the night of Jan. 7 the All-Russian Central Executive Committee, on Lenin\u2019s motion, passed a decree dissolving the constituent assembly. The dictatorship of the proletariat, said Lenin, meant the greatest possible degree of democracy for the toiling majority of the people, putting in the hands of labour all those material goods (buildings for meetings, printing presses and so on) lacking which \u201cliberty\u201d remains an illusion. The dictatorship of the proletariat in Lenin\u2019s view is a necessary stage in the abolition of class divisions in society.\nThe question of war and peace provoked a new crisis. A considerable proportion of the party demanded a \u201crevolutionary war\u201d against the Hohenzollerns, leaving out of account altogether the economic situation of Russia and the temper of the peasantry. Lenin felt that it was necessary for propaganda purposes to drag out negotiations with the Germans for as long as possible. But he demanded that, in the event of a German ultimatum, peace should be signed even at the price of a loss of territory or the payment of an indemnity. The revolution kindling in the west would sooner or later undo the hard terms of peace. Lenin\u2019s political realism manifested itself in all its strength in regard to this question. The majority of the Central Committee in opposition to Lenin made a further attempt to avoid yielding to German imperialism by declaring the state of war at an end, but refusing at the same time to sign an imperialistic peace. This led to a renewed attack by the Germans. After heated debates in the Central Committee at the sitting of Feb. 18 Lenin won a majority for his proposal that negotiations should be reopened forthwith, and that the German terms which were now still more unfavourable should be signed.\nThe Soviet Government on Lenin\u2019s initiative transferred itself to Moscow. Peace having been attained, Lenin now brought before the party and the country the whole question of its economic and cultural organization.\nThe greatest trials, however, were still to come. By the end of the summer of 1918 Central Russia found itself surrounded by a ring of fire. Hand in hand with the Russian counter-revolution there came the rising of the Czechoslovaks on the Volga; on the north and south came the British intervention (in Archangel on Aug. 2, in Baku on Aug. 14). Food supplies were cut off. Lenin never ceased to direct his party and the Government. He carried on propaganda work, roused the masses, organized the getting of corn; followed the enemy\u2019s movements, was in direct communication with the Red Army. He followed the international situation, finding his bearings by the dissensions in the camps of the imperialists. He found time for interviews with foreign revolutionaries and with Soviet engineers and economists.\nOn Aug. 30 the Social-Revolutionary Kaplan aimed two shots at Lenin when on his way to a workers\u2019 meeting. This attack intensified the civil war. Lenin\u2019s strong constitution quickly recovered from the effect of his wounds. During his convalescence he wrote a pamphlet, The Proletarian Revolution and the Renegade Kautsky, directed against the most prominent theorist of the Second International. By Oct. 22 he was again speaking in public.\nThe New Economic Policy. \u2013 The war on the home fronts remained his chief occupation. Economic and administrative problems had necessarily to take a subordinate place. The civil war fed from abroad was at its height. The struggle ended at the beginning of 1921 with the utter defeat of the counter-revolution and the Government grew in strength. The fact that the War had not led immediately to a proletarian revolution in Europe had enormously increased the difficulties of Socialist reconstruction, which was impossible without agreement between the proletariat and the peasantry. The system of requisitioning superfluities from the peasants must be replaced by a tax correctly assessed. Private interchange of commodities must be allowed. These measures began a new phase in the development of the Oct. (Nov.) revolution, that known as the \u201cnew economic policy.\u201d\nIn his policy within the Soviet Federation Lenin tried, in every way to create for the nationalities which had been oppressed under Tsarism, conditions of free national development. He made unsparing war against all imperialist tendencies especially within the party itself \u2013 the purity of whose ideas he guarded with the utmost jealousy. The charges of oppressing nationalities made against Lenin and his party with reference to Georgia, etc., were the product of the sharp class warfare within the nation.\nThe principles of national self-determination, Lenin insisted on applying in full to colonial peoples. His doctrine was that the Western European proletariat should refrain from mere declarations of sympathy with oppressed nationalities, and instead should join them in the struggle against imperialism.\nAt the eighth congress of Soviets (1920) Lenin made a report on the work carried out on his initiative for the drafting of a plan for the electrification of the country. The gradual effort towards a high degree of technical development is the mark of the successful transformation from the system of small scale peasant economy, with its lack of co-ordination, to the system of large scale Socialist production based on a single, comprehensive plan. \u201cSocialism is a Soviet Govt. plus electrification.\u201d\nDeath. \u2013 The exhaustion brought on by excessive hard work over a number of years ruined Lenin\u2019s health. Sclerosis attacked his cerebral arteries. At the beginning of 1922 his doctors forbade him daily work. From June to Aug. the disease made rapid progress, and for the first time he began to lose the power of speech, and in Dec. he became paralysed in the right arm and leg. He died on Jan. 21, 1924, at 6.30 p.m., at Gorky, near Moscow. His funeral was the occasion for an unexampled manifestation of love and grief on the part of millions.\nLenin\u2019s outward appearance was distinguished by simplicity and strength. He was below the middle height, with the plebeian features of the Slavonic type of face, brightened by piercing eyes; and his powerful forehead and still more powerful head gave him a marked distinction. He was tireless in work to an unparalleled degree. He put the same exemplary conscientiousness into reading lectures in a small workmen\u2019s club in Zurich and in organizing the first Socialist State in the world.

His way of life in the Kremlin was little different from his life as an \u00e9migr\u00e9 abroad.

{"text":"Collaboration will deliver greater value, more coordinated health care to patients in Wake County\nRALEIGH, N.C. (February 14, 2017) \u2014 WakeMed Health & Hospitals and Duke Health have signed a joint operating agreement to work together to deliver highly-coordinated cardiovascular care, a broader scope of services and greater value and affordability to Wake County\u2019s growing population of heart patients. Duke Health and WakeMed are also in discussions related to a similar collaboration involving cancer services in Wake County.\nThis is not a merger between the two organizations. Duke Health and WakeMed will continue to operate independently apart from the collaboration and maintain their own identities.\nThe heart care collaboration \u2013 Heart Care Plus+ \u2013 will serve the cardiovascular care needs of patients in Wake County, providing patients greater value and more options for quality heart care. On March 1, Heart Care Plus+ will begin a transition and integration process that will bring both heart teams together to work toward swift implementation. During the transition period, the goal is to introduce some new services and offerings through Heart Care Plus+.\nAs the trusted, preferred provider of heart care in Wake County for more than 50 years, WakeMed will continue to offer high-quality services to patients at the WakeMed Heart Center and its network of convenient physician practice locations, while providing an even broader scope of care by coordinating with Duke to provide additional specialty and sub-specialty services closer to home. Duke University Hospital will be available for highly complex surgical interventions (i.e. transplantation) that require its advanced surgical technologies and capabilities.\nDuke and WakeMed announced in June of 2014 an agreed-upon framework to explore and evaluate potential opportunities for clinical collaboration while maintaining their independence. Over time, the health systems determined that collaborating in heart and cancer care would enhance the scope, quality and value of care in ways that neither Duke nor WakeMed could achieve alone, and without the need for costly new construction or infrastructure.\n\u201cThis is a very exciting and important development that we believe will further enhance patient care in Wake County,\u201d explains Donald Gintzig, WakeMed president & CEO. \u201cAs health systems continue to focus on improving the care and value we deliver to our patients, working together can help us all achieve greater coordination of care and clinical quality. As leaders in our respective areas of expertise, both Duke and WakeMed have the opportunity to learn a great deal from one another \u2013 all in the best interest of our patients and the care we deliver together.\u201d\nAbout WakeMed Health & Hospitals\nServing the community since 1961, WakeMed Health & Hospitals is a nationally recognized, private, not-for-profit health care organization founded and based in Raleigh, N.C. The largest health system in Wake County, WakeMed exists to improve the health and well-being of our community by providing outstanding, compassionate, patient- and family-centered care to all. The 919-bed system comprises a network of facilities throughout the Triangle area, delivering health and wellness services that bring added value to the communities we serve.\nWakeMed is a leader in cardiac and vascular care, women\u2019s and children\u2019s services, emergency medicine and trauma care, physical rehabilitation, orthopaedics and neurosciences.

{"text":"Mike needs to borrow $50 in order to buy the carburettor that Ben's brother needs for his performance car. But no one in the family will lend him the money even though he is prepared to sell his beloved card collection.\nSubtheme(s): Gender roles and stereotypes,Multiculturalism\nThe 1970s saw a groundswell of political activism in Australia on many fronts: the peace movement, environmental protection, feminism and workers' rights. The Galbally Review of Post-Arrival Programs and Services for Migrants opened the door to the idea of migrants' rights, a concept that paved the way for multiculturalism.\nIn this clip, the role of the women in Mike's family is clearly defined. Ask students to analyse the women in Mike's family, their roles and the differences in their roles.\nAsk students to complete the 'historyface' template for the women in Mike's family: his grandmother (Yaya), mother (Janice) and aunt (Sofia). The students can share their findings with the rest of the class.\nSubtheme(s): Gender roles and stereotypes,Multiculturalism\nFashions of the 1970s extended the look established in the 1960s with the mini-skirt. Fashions for women became more daring and colourful, as 'mod', 'surfie', 'hippy' and 'disco' styles became fashionable. Fashions for men became more casual, pairing jeans with sandals, and flares with platform shoes.\nDiscuss the topic, 'How does fashion highlight the changing tastes in culture, attitudes and behaviour of each era?' and make a list of how fashion creates a 'point of view' in history.\nAsk students to talk with their parents about fashion in the 1970s. They could bring some photos or original outfits belonging to their parents and share these with the class.\nAsk students to use the body template in Student Activity Sheet H4.5 to create three different 1970s outfits using paper and fabric. A photo of the student's face can be added to the template to personalise it. Upload the images to the school website as an album of 1970s fashion.\nSubtheme(s): Customs and traditions,Entertainment and games\nCard collecting and trading has been a favourite pastime of many Australian children for decades. Collecting cards that are rare is the key to a good collection.\nAsk students to discuss the following questions and create a mind map of ideas:\nWhat types of cards are collected and traded?\nAre card collections valuable? If so, which are the most valuable collections?\nWhere did card collecting originate and when?\nWhat changes have impacted on card collecting and trading in the past 50 years?\nAsk students to discuss their card collections. Have them write a report on why they collect these types of cards, how they purchase or trade them, what type of cards they need to complete the collection, and which cards are most valuable to them and why.\nAsk students to design their own card that would fit into the collection. The card must have an image and text. It must have a registration number that fits with the number order of the collection.\nAlternatively, ask students to create a series of five cards depicting something of interest to them. The cards should include a picture of the item on the front and information on the back. Students could give a short presentation on why their cards are the most exclusive and sought after by other collectors.\nThe Australian Curriculum: English aims to ensure that students:\nlearn to listen to, read, view, speak, write, create and reflect on increasingly complex and sophisticated spoken, written and multimodal texts across a growing range of contexts with accuracy, fluency and purpose\nappreciate, enjoy and use the English language in all its variations and develop a sense of its richness and power to evoke feelings, convey information, form ideas, facilitate interaction with others, entertain, persuade and argue\nunderstand how Standard Australian English works in its spoken and written forms and in combination with non-linguistic forms of communication to create meaning\ndevelop interest and skills in inquiring into the aesthetic aspects of texts, and develop an informed appreciation of literature.\nCustoms and traditions,Entertainment and games\nMike has a card collection that is important to him. As a class, discuss the reasons why Mike might be interested in collecting cards. Ask the students to consider:\nWhat does this tell the audience about the character of Mike?\nWhat could be the reasons the filmmaker included this information in the story?\nConduct a class survey of the things students collect and present these findings as a pictorial representation such as a bar graph, or with text and images. Evaluate and assess the most popular collections and describe the reasons given by students for collecting these items.\nAs an extension activity, students can survey members of their family (parents, grandparents and siblings) to find out what they collected when they were young. Encourage students to collate this information on a graph, electronic spreadsheet, or record it manually on paper.\nThe survey results can be presented to the class, showing the differences and similarities in collections over the years. As a class, discuss the variety of objects collected over different generations and highlight the differences in objects collected today compared to in the past.\nEncourage students to bring examples of collections to the classroom to share and compare.\nArt, music and literature,Fashion,Relationships\nMusic is used by the filmmaker to introduce Mike's young aunt Sofia as she plays records in her bedroom with her friend. As a class, discuss why the filmmaker chose to use music to introduce this scene and focus on Sofia when she held a record in her hand as music was played. Was this to indicate her interest in music?\nAsk students to create a character profile of Sofia that answers the following questions:\nHow is Sofia dressed?\nWhat type of fashion are her clothes representative of for the era?\nWhat could have influenced her style?\nWhat style of music is she listening to?\nWhat are her likes and dislikes?\nWhat are her hobbies and interests?\nThe character profile can be created using the template from Student Activity Sheet E4.4.\nEntertainment and games,Inventions and electronic media\nAsk students to think about Sofia playing a favourite record in her room with her friend and relate it to the activity called \u2018Record Collection\u2019 in the clip \u2018Conscription\u2019 ten years earlier in 1968. There Sofia was ten years old and asked to look after Michaelis's precious record collection of LPs (Long Playing records).\nAsk students to find out more information about records and the format of singles and EPs in the 1960s and 1970s. Ask students to draw up a list of the ways music is played in the twenty-first century. Students can then compile a list of popular artists and songs of the era and create a 1970s playlist to share with the class.\nFrom the list, ask students to select a group that is unknown to them and research information on the group. Ask students to design a record cover for an album by the group. It could be an album that was produced, or an imaginary one. The album cover should list eight and ten songs the group were known for.","metadata":{"date":1709479747000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947476396.49\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240303142747-20240303172747-00798.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9609186649,"token_count":1497,"url":"https:\/\/myplace.edu.au\/teaching_activities\/clip\/3413"},"score":4,"id":"163"}

One they\u2019ll get a month to complete, for instance, so they can manage their time and won\u2019t suffer any delays in other courses.\nGerald Jonker, programme director at the bachelor of industrial engineering and management, understands the students\u2019 concern and isn\u2019t pleased with how the situation worked out. \u2018We\u2019re seriously considering their suggestions.\u2019\nThe exam committee is now exploring alternative options. \u2018But I can\u2019t say anything about that, it\u2019s up to the committee to make that decision. But we\u2019re honestly trying to prioritise the students\u2019 interests and come up with the best solution.\u2019\nExactly what happens remains a mystery. All lecturers in the vicinity at the time of the exam have been emailed, the courier service has been questioned, and everyone with even the slightest access to the exam has been talked to. \u2018We considered every possible angle, even the unlikely ones\u2019, says Jonker. But so far, the case has not been solved.\nIt definitely wasn\u2019t the course lecturer\u2019s fault, he says. After the exam at the Aletta Jacobs hall, they placed the box in the room where all exams are temporarily kept. Lecturers can only access this room with the help of a concierge, who can see the door to the room at all times.\nSo while procedures were followed, the box was gone when the lecturer returned. \u2018As far as I know, this has never happened before. It\u2019s really unfortunate, especially for the students\u2019, says Jonker.\nWhat if another lecturer sees they accidentally took the wrong box with them? \u2018The exam committee will have to decide whether the exams are still valid.\u2019","metadata":{"date":1709203151000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947474808.39\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240229103115-20240229133115-00499.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9651020765,"token_count":565,"url":"https:\/\/ukrant.nl\/dozens-of-exams-lost-students-have-to-take-a-resit\/?lang=en"},"score":0,"id":"166"}

{"text":"Whether you want to cultivate a crop as a farmer or desire to have a beautiful garden in your backyard, understanding the difference between annual, Biennial and perennial plants is essential. These three types of plants have distinct needs; depending on your goal for growing them, it\u2019s important to meet those needs accordingly.\nWhat Is A Biennial Plant?\nIn addition to annual and perennial plants, another category falls between these two groups, known as biennial plants. Biennial plants are a type of flowering plant that have two growing periods, or years, to finish their life cycle. In the first year, these plants focus on creating roots, stems, and leaves. In the second year, they start producing flowers, fruits, and seeds before their life ends.\nWhat Is A Perennial Plant?\nA perennial is a type of plant that lives for several years. Perennials are often resilient to cold and resume their growth in the spring season.\nAnnual vs. Perennial Plants\nGenerally, annuals are plants that live, grow, produce seeds, and die within one year. The seeds from that plant will start the same cycle in the next year. Perennials, on the other hand, are plants that live for more than two years. They can produce seeds in the first year, like annuals, but the original plant doesn\u2019t die. Instead, it continues to grow and can produce more seeds in the second year, and so on .\nWhy Annual, Biennial, Or Perennial Plants?\nAnnuals (such as Ageratum, Amaranthus, Cornflower, etc.) are a boon to gardens because of their vibrant hues, long blooming period, and ease of cultivation. Their capacity to continuously produce striking flowers or decorative leaves from the beginning of summer until frost makes them extremely valuable. Annuals are excellent choices for bright window boxes, containers, hanging baskets, and especially gardens used for educational purposes, such as in schools.\nThe rapid growth of annuals from seeds or transplants can be a rewarding experience. There are even cool-season annuals, like pansies and ornamental kale, which can be planted in the fall, serving as replacements for summer annuals in various settings, from containers and window boxes to gardens .\nIn the food industry, many economically important food crops are annuals, such as corn, wheat, peas, and others.\nPansy flowers (Annual plant)\nPerennials (such as Tulip, narcissus, Dwarf iris, etc.) offer certain benefits because of their ability to return each year. When cultivated in suitable conditions, these plants can quickly fill spaces, often reaching their full size a few years after planting and forming large, eye-catching groups. With hundreds of distinct perennials, each offering unique textures, colors, scents, and shapes, the process of choosing the right plants can be an exciting journey. While most perennials have a relatively brief blooming period, typically between one to three weeks, some varieties, like the coreopsis, can bloom consistently for up to six weeks. With a thoughtful selection of perennials, you can maintain interest in your garden from the beginning of spring until frost and even throughout the winter .\nIn agriculture, various crops that hold significant economic value are perennials and produce a harvest for several years. These include all tree crops (apple, citrus, etc.), alfalfa, mint, and others.\nDwarf Iris flower (Perennial Plant)\nBiennial plants, like certain types of bellflowers and some forget-me-nots, follow a two-year life plan. You typically find biennial plants in climates with distinct seasons, and they often endure winter months by going dormant underground. These differ from annuals which live for a year, or perennials, which live for multiple years.\nIn agriculture, an important plant in this group is the carrot. We usually pick carrots in their first year when the root, the part we eat, is fully grown. But if we leave it untouched, the carrot will use the nutrients stored in its root to grow flowers and seeds in its second year.\nForget-me-not flower (Biennial plant)\nTable Of Annual And Perennial Flowers\n(Botanical And Common Name) \n|Centaurea cyanus, Bachelor Button (cornflower)\n|Achillea hybrids, Yarrow\n|Cosmos bipinnatis, Cosmos\n|Baptisia australis, False indigo\n|Gomphrena globose, Globe Amaranth\n|Iris reticulata, Dwarf Iris\n|Lantana camara, Lantana\n|Callirhoe involucrate, Prairie winecups\n|Petunia x hybrida, Petunia\n|Delosperma cooperi, Purple ice plant\n|Portulaca grandifloria, Rose Moss\n|Gypsophila paniculate, Baby\u2019s breath\n|Sanvitalia procumbens Creeping Zinnia, Trailing Sanvitalia\n|Rudbeckia fulgida, orange coneflower or Black-eyed Susan\n|Tithonia rotundifolia, Mexican Sunflower\n|Lavandula angustifolia, English lavender\nCharacteristics And Impacts Of Annual vs Perennial Systems In Agriculture\nIn essence, while annual plants have their benefits, especially in agricultural production, perennial systems offer advantages in terms of soil health, water conservation, and nutrient retention. Some of the most important differences between annual and perennial plants in agriculture are as below [2, 4]:\nAnnuals: Annual plants generally propagate through seeds. After maturing and flowering, they drop their seeds which then germinate and grow into new plants the following year. However, some annual and biennial plants, like marigolds, violas, pansies, and snapdragons, are best started in a propagation bed or tray and then transplanted to the garden as small plants.\nPerennials: In contrast, perennial plants live for more than two years. They can be propagated in several ways, including by division, cuttings, and seeds.\nLet\u2019s look deeper at propagation by division, commonly used for perennials. For fall-blooming plants like asters, you divide them in early spring. Conversely, spring bloomers like irises can be divided in late summer or early fall. You usually take vigorous shoots from the outer part of a clump, divide the plant into several sections, and replant. Small divisions may not bloom much in the first year after planting.\nPropagation by cuttings is another method used for many perennials. Here, you take tip cuttings from the plants and place them in a clean planting mix. This method is more complex and requires good care, including maintaining humidity and temperature, to ensure that the cutting forms roots.\nRudbeckia Fulgida flower (Perennial plant)\nFrequency of Fertilizing: Annual plants need regular fertilizing due to their rapid growth, approximately every three weeks. In contrast, established perennials generally need less frequent fertilizing \u2013 often just at the start of their growth period each year. Some late-blooming perennials may require monthly feedings until September.\nInitial Fertilizing: Both annuals and perennials can benefit from initial fertilization at planting time. You can incorporate about 5 pounds of 5-10-5 or 5-10-10 fertilizer per 100 square feet.\nSupplemental Fertilizing: After planting, annuals should be fertilized regularly to support their rapid growth. Conversely, perennials usually only need extra nutrients twice per year if soil conditions are good.\nTiming based on Blooming: Perennials that bloom in late summer or fall, like asters, need regular fertilization before blooming, while those that complete their growth by June, like peonies, don\u2019t need midsummer fertilizer. Annuals typically require consistent fertilization throughout their growing season due to their continuous growth and blooming.\nPetunia flower (Annual plant)\nAnnuals: Since they complete their life cycle in a single growing season, generally have shallower root systems. As a result, they often require regular watering. This is because their roots don\u2019t extend deep into the soil to access more distant water reserves. However, there are exceptions. For instance, cosmos (Cosmos bipinnatus), a type of annual, can tolerate drought condition spells in the summer.\nPerennials: On the other hand, perennials usually have deeper root systems. This allows them to withstand dry conditions better once they are established. Nevertheless, they shouldn\u2019t be allowed to dry out during their first growing season. They need consistent watering in their first year to establish their root systems effectively.\nYarrow flower (Perennial plant)\nAnnuals: These plants live for just one growing season. After they bloom and produce seeds, they die.\nPerennials: They live for more than two years, producing flowers and seeds multiple times throughout their lifespan.\nAnnuals: Soil profiles under annual crops may experience up to 5 times more water flow compared to those supporting perennials.\nPerennials: Perennial systems, due to their extensive root network, help in reducing water flow, which in turn conserves water and nutrients.\nBachelor Button flower (Annual plant)\nAnnuals: Annual systems can lead to a significant increase in nutrient loss, especially nitrogen.\nPerennials: They efficiently capture and use available nutrients, resulting in minimal nutrient loss.\nAnnuals: In order to cultivate annual plants, fields need to be replowed and replanted each year. This can result increase the risk of soil erosion.\nPerennials: These plants are significantly more effective in controlling soil erosion. Their continuous cover helps maintain topsoil, which is vital for soil health.\nPurple ice flower (Perennial plant)\nCompetition With Weeds\nAnnuals: They are not well synchronized with yearly climatic and soil conditions; hence, they often struggle to compete with weeds for water and nutrients.\nPerennial: They are usually adapted to local conditions, often resulting in natural resistance against weeds without requiring significant intervention.\nAnnuals: They need high amounts of fertilizers and herbicides due to their struggle against weeds and short growth window.\nPerennials: Generally require fewer inputs as they are better adapted to local conditions.\nCosmos flower (Annual plant)\nAnnuals: Their cultivation can lead to water pollution due to soil and agrochemical runoff. They contribute significantly to non-point-sourced nitrogen and phosphorus in water systems.\nPerennials: Are often recommended for conservation efforts, as they help improve water quality and reduce soil erosion. They typically have deeper roots which can help in preventing nutrient runoff.\nAnnuals: While they might offer economic benefits in terms of harvest, their environmental costs can lead to issues like water treatment costs for communities.\nPerennials: While potentially less profitable than high-demand annual crops, their environmental benefits could lead to long-term economic gains for the community by preserving local ecosystems and reducing water treatment needs.\nIn conclusion, while annual plants are often staples in agricultural production, considerable environmental challenges are associated with their cultivation. On the other hand, perennial plants, although less common in mainstream agriculture, offer promising solutions for sustainable land management and conservation. It\u2019s essential to strike a balance between production and conservation to benefit the environment and local communities.","metadata":{"date":1709056003000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947474676.79\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240227153053-20240227183053-00198.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9418643713,"token_count":2409,"url":"https:\/\/floristkid.com\/annual-vs-perennial-vs-biennial-plants\/"},"score":4,"id":"168"}

{"text":"Apple cider vinegar is not a kitchen staple but a profound natural remedy. Hippocrates- the father of modern medicine- first used ACV to treat wounds in 400 BC. Since then, apple cider vinegar remedies have a strong repute for their benefits.\nACV treats many health issues, including obesity, high cholesterol, and high blood pressure. It is also a potent anti-inflammatory agent. Thus, it cures many diseases produced due to inflammation, such as arthritis. Combined with other healthy choices, ACV can do wonders for your health.\nWhat is Apple Cider Vinegar?\nApple cider vinegar is a fermented liquid made from apples. Fermentation converts the sugar present in apples into acetic acid. Besides acetic acid, ACV also contains polyphenols, antioxidants, and vitamins.\nThe \u2018mother\u2019 vinegar- the unfiltered one- is more beneficial for your body. It has a cloudy appearance due to enzymes, probiotics, proteins, pectin, and minerals.\nWhat is Arthritis?\nArthritis is a common disorder affecting the joints.

But, medications for arthritis come with greater side effects.\nSo people tend to use natural remedies, such as apple cider vinegar. Many have found ACV to be the answer to the callings of their pained joints. Exercise, a healthy diet, and losing weight also help manage your arthritis.\nThe Science Behind The Remedy:\nApple cider vinegar works against arthritis in any of the following ways:\nInflammation is the marked cause of pain and damage to the joints in arthritis. Apple cider vinegar fights off inflammation, which reduces pain and swelling. Antioxidants present in ACV prevent free-radical damage to the joint tissues.\n- Dissolving Acid Crystals:\nApple cider vinegar dissolves acid crystals build-up in the joints. Thus, it reduces the stiffness and swelling of the joint.\nApple cider vinegar contains another major ingredient \u2013 pectin. The pectin, with acetic acid, eliminates the toxins responsible for the degenerative damage to your joints.\nYour body weight impacts your arthritis a great deal. Extra weight means extra pressure and exertion on your joints, the knees, feet, and hips. Doctors strongly recommend shedding some weight if you have arthritis (even if you don\u2019t have arthritis, losing that extra fat isn\u2019t bad).\nACV is the perfect tool to reach your weight loss goal. As per the Journal Of The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, apple cider vinegar controls blood sugar levels and contributes to weight loss.\nIt also curbs hunger and promotes satiation, thus restricting overeating. Use the best apple cider vinegar for weight loss to cut extra pressure on your joints and improve mobility.\nApple cider vinegar contains many minerals, including magnesium, potassium, calcium, and phosphorus. These minerals make up for the mineral deficiency in your body. Thus, it helps with reducing joint pain.\nHow To Use Apple Cider Vinegar For Arthritis?\nThere are many ways you can use ACV for treating arthritis:\n- The most common way to use apple cider vinegar is to drink it. Take a spoonful of raw, unfiltered mother vinegar in the mornings and afternoon. You can dilute it with water or take it with honey if you don\u2019t like the taste.\n- Use it in soups, like salad dressings, or include a little in your daily food.\n- Mix a small amount of apple cider vinegar with an oil (coconut oil or olive oil). Rub this paste on the affected joints gently.\n- You can take a bath with apple cider vinegar as well. Add a little amount to the bathtub and soak for 30 minutes. It reduces the stiffness and soreness of the joints.\nSome Other Ways To Manage Your Arthritis:\nBesides ACV, there are countless ways to manage arthritis and next joint pain.\nHealthy Diet \u2013 fresh fruits, vegetables, and superfoods improve your immune system and health. They provide the essential nutrients for healthy joints and muscles.\nExercise \u2013 exercise keeps your joints flexible and reduces your weight. Get low-impact exercises, such as walking or tai-chi.\nAcupuncture \u2013 is an ancient Chinese medical treatment. While there is no extensive research, acupuncture may relieve joint pain and swelling.\nCold Treatment \u2013 applying ice packs or frozen vegetables (wrapped in a cloth) provides instant relief from pain and swelling\nWhile there is no research-back evidence to support ACV as a remedy for arthritis. Yet, its use in small amounts accounts for no harm. Natural remedies in combination with prescribed medicines can elevate pain. However, consult your doctor before using apple cider vinegar or other natural remedies.","metadata":{"date":1709328244000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947475701.61\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240301193300-20240301223300-00499.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9094644785,"token_count":1090,"url":"https:\/\/somaliupdate.com\/how-does-apple-cider-vinegar-relieve-arthritis\/"},"score":3,"id":"174"}

{"text":"Acceptance, balance, reflection and love. No, I am not talking about the keys to a happy life (although these to hold true to that as well), but how you can make the most out of your space and how to use size, style and decor to your advantage. More and more of us are downsizing to smaller homes or choosing condo living over owning a house, and then there are those of us who are renting apartments or smaller homes until that dream place comes along. Whatever the situation may be, these tips will not only help you make the most out of your space, but also make it a more enjoyable and welcoming place to live.\nFirst and foremost we must accept our space. It is easy to look on Pinterest, scroll through our daily blog feed, flip through the magazines and see these homes which physically can not be replicated in our current spaces We have to be realistic with our wants and needs. For example, we see a beautiful California King four poster bed with all the trimmings but we only live in a 500sq ft apartment, Its just not happening is it? Instead look for inspiration from similar style spaces and homes. The sooner you accept your space that you have and start taking steps to make the most of it the faster you will appreciate your home for what it is.\nArrange your furniture in such a way that there is flow to your space. Make sure you can easily travel from one room to the next in a easy and free motion. Don't put pieces in your home which don't fit, over cramming will only lead to a unusable and over crowded space.\nUse a constant variety of different textures and materials; mix your woods and metallics, use pops of color and a variety of textures. Connect each room by repeating these patterns through out the entire space. This will help the space flow together, as if they are extensions of each other rather than several small, disjointed areas.\n4. Let Go\nHoarding. Need I say more. Go through all your stuff: your closet, books, pantry, kitchen supplies, everything! Anything your haven't used in 6-12 months donate. You don't need it, but that doesn't mean to say someone else won't appreciate it. Getting rid of unwanted things not only clears your space but also your mind.\n5. Leave Your Comfort Zone\nI have mentioned this before, that one of this biggest design mistakes we see is people playing it too safe. Just because you are in a small place doesn't mean you have to stick to white walls, neutral curtains, beige rugs and cream pillows (not to over exaggerate). Add pops of colors to your walls, find bold patterns to use as your window dressings or bed linens, paint a few pieces of furniture in unexpected colors. All of these little things are your stamp, they are your expression. Don't be afraid.\n6. Filling the Void\nWhen living in a small space we really have to make the most of every little inch we have available. Think, under the bed, on top of the cupboards, empty walls. Anywhere and everywhere must be used to its best advantage for not only function but decor and style as well.\n7. See the Light\nNatural Light. I can't say it enough. Don't block it with heavy curtains and blinds instead choose sheer fabrics to get the most light possible from your windows. Light opens spaces and fills with positive and warm energy.\nAgain with the natural light, placing mirrors to reflect light and brighten up a space will also make a room appear larger.\nThere are special tricks with decorating which can play with the mind and make a space look larger than it actually is. For example, hanging curtains from the top the ceiling as appose to from the top of the window. Using a larger area rug instead of a small floating rug. Replace lots of small furniture with a few larger statement pieces can actually make the room appear bigger (just not too many). Oversized mirrors, paintings and art of the walls also have the safe effect.\nAnd finally the most important tip is to style and decorate your space with love and care and make it a home that you feel comfortable in and enjoy.\nHope you all enjoyed!","metadata":{"date":1708949284000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947474659.73\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240226094435-20240226124435-00299.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9497765899,"token_count":876,"url":"https:\/\/www.thelondonfactory.com\/blogs\/inspiration\/making-the-most-of-your-space"},"score":2,"id":"177"}

{"text":"Here for the Summer\nOne of the activities I get to do each year is photograph the new crop of fresh faced interns for the program that my Wife Runs. It is always fun to watch these fresh faced youngsters arrive in Austin and then as the summer goes on, grow close together until the end of the program when its time to wrap up. As part of the wrap up, they get to travel to corporate headquarters (Wahoo) and present to the CEO (yikes) and as part of that preparation we take teams pictures. For the team pictures, I don't consider them to be interns, instead they are my client and I work with them accordingly to compose a team picture that truly sums up them as a team as well as the project that they worked on and presenting. And finally there is always the group photo, where again the focus is not about a staged\/pose picture, but a photograph that captures the essence of the group.\nThe first group, it was \"OK - show us just how existed you are to be in Austin!\", that got an immediate reaction as you can see. Ultimately I had to merge 3 photos together because they were so active, no single picture was sufficient to show all 3 at their best, so why not take the best of each and bring them together (and yes she was able to jump that high).\nFor the second group I said \"Well, that first group did well, hope you can match them?\", \"Nah, we're just gonna hang out and enjoy the warm evening, maybe get a beer afterwards\" - can't argue with that.\nThe third group was a bit more of a challenge, a little more shy than the others perhaps, so moved them over to a different spot and tried to get them to relax \"Come one now ... lets imagine we're taking a picture for an Album cover!\", \"What\u2019s an Album cover?\".

At one point, he worked 28 hours consecutively.\n\"For the first six months, maybe a year I was pretty pumped to be at work because I was just learning so much because I was just working so many hours,\" Chon told Insider, adding that it took him another year to really get comfortable with his job.\nChon lays out his experiences at a top-tier bank to his 40,000 subscribers and more than 1 million viewers on his YouTube channel, Rareliquid. In a typical video, Chon will talk about how to land a role at an investment bank, and what to expect when you get there. He also posts explainers on tech, markets, and cryptocurrencies.\nHe is one of a number of junior bankers who have given up the potential to earn a six-figure starting salary, instead starting social media channels to offer advice on breaking into the industry.\nNow 28, Chon told Insider that he made the decision to quit banking in 2018 after his mother was diagnosed with ALS, an incurable neurological disease. He said it made him realize that nothing in life is certain.\nAfter backpacking around the world for several months and setting up a short-lived clothing brand, he turned to YouTube, realizing there was demand from people who wanted advice on breaking into finance as a career.\n\"I thought maybe I can provide really good advice, do really good research, and maybe this will work,\" he said.\nGrowing a YouTube channel enables him to earn while he remains in Korea helping care for his mother.\nIn Chon's latest earnings update, which he posts monthly on his channel, he states he had earned $19,161 by July 2021 for the year to date - a roughly 87% drop on the $150,000 salary and bonus he says he earned at JPMorgan.\nHe makes money from ads running on his channel, brand sponsorships, and increasingly by offering courses and resume advice.\n\"I'm not actually viewing Rareliquid as a YouTube channel,\" he added. \"I have a lot of ideas for the different revenue streams and mini businesses within the whole business.\"\nLike Chon, Afzal Hussein broadly enjoyed his career in finance, working in asset management at Goldman Sachs' London office. He said he had always planned to reassess his career three years after starting.\n\"I thought: 'I'm not really having an impact in the world by going to this bank, putting on a suit and tie and helping companies invest,'\" Hussein told Insider.\nHussein's channel, started in November 2018, now has 87,000 subscribers, and just under 6 million views across a range of videos that cover finance- and career-focused videos.\nHe describes himself as a \"non-traditional Goldman story\".\nHe grew up on a council estate in London - equivalent to projects in the US - looked after by one parent managing five children. This upbringing instilled a desire in Hussein to help people from underrepresented backgrounds \"get into roles that they previously didn't think that they could.\"\n\"If I had someone on YouTube who was sharing all this golden advice, that would have helped me save so much time throughout university,\" said Hussein.\nHussein's videos tend to be more career-focused. In a typical video, he'll provide advice on what to do after you secure an internship, or how to find a graduate scheme, but he also provides insight into the daily routine of an investment banker.\nHe said a video series of him reviewing the finance-focused TV show \"Industry\" was also popular.\nHussein spends two to three days planning, scripting, filming, and editing to create up to three videos a week, and has multiple streams of income across his channel, as well as offering career coaching.\nHe plans to launch his own mentoring website, Simpley.io, which aims to match aspirational teenagers with professionals.\nHussein won't reveal specifics to Insider, but says his current earnings are higher than his Goldman's salary. \"I don't like putting a number on it because I don't want to get the young people carried away with focusing on numbers,\" he said. \"I don't ever want to take it for granted.\"\nAnother YouTuber, Angela, has racked up 10,000 subscribers to videos covering her typical day when she was working as an investment banker in New York, her reviews of industry news, and her advice on avoiding burnout.

{"text":"On July 31, Toyota announced that in order to provide satisfactory and competitive electric products to Chinese customers, Toyota decided to further strengthen the local research and development of intelligent and electrified technology.\nIt is understood that Toyota Automotive Research and Development Center (China) Co., Ltd., Toyota's largest R & D base in China, will officially change its name to Toyota Intelligent Electric vehicle Research and Development Center (China) Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as \"IEM by TOYOTA\") on August 1st. The R & D center engineers of Toyota's three joint ventures in China (FAW Toyota Motor Co., Ltd., Guangzhou Automobile Toyota Co., Ltd., and BYD Toyota Electric vehicle Technology Co., Ltd.) will all join the research and development project led by IEM by TOYOTA. Denso and Ericsson will also participate in the research and development of IEM by TOYOTA to speed up the research and development of electric powertrain.\nIn the field of electrification, Toyota uses multi-path solutions as the core to achieve carbon neutrality and strengthen the local research and development of omni-directional electric vehicles (BEV, PHEV, HEV, FCEV). In the field of intelligence, Toyota will accelerate the design and development of intelligent cockpits to achieve better user experience through live space design and AI technology, as well as autopilot technology and advanced safety technology that are more in line with the actual road conditions in China.\nToyota China said that in order to improve its competitiveness, it would strive to achieve a sharp reduction in manufacturing costs through measures in three areas: \"expanding local suppliers\", \"improving parts design\" and \"reforming production technology and manufacturing processes\". Toyota China Minister Daro Ueda said: by promoting local research and development with IEM by TOYOTA as the core, we can rapidly develop and provide products that satisfy Chinese customers and are competitive.\nAccording to data released by Toyota, 5.4198 million new cars (including Dafa \/ Hino) were delivered worldwide in the first half of 2023, up 5.5 per cent from a year earlier, with a total of 879400 new cars delivered in the Chinese market, down 2.8 per cent from the same period last year. It is worth mentioning that Toyota's global sales of electric vehicles (BEV, PHEV, HEV, FCEV) reached 1.7103 million in the first half of the year, up 23.2% from the same period last year, but only 46200 pure electric vehicles were sold.\nIn the most competitive Chinese market, Toyota's performance in the electric car market is also far below expectations. Data show that Toyota sold 294500 electric models in China in the first half of the year, up 6.2% from the same period last year, but most of the sales came from HEV models, while the market performance of BEV models was mediocre. Toyota already has domestic electric vehicles, including bZ4X and bZ3, of which bZ4X sold 9173 and bZ3 8222 in the first half of the year.\nAlthough Toyota has a relatively positive layout in China's electric vehicle market, if it wants to further improve the market scale, it must enhance its competitiveness in China's pure electric vehicle market. Toyota previously announced that it has achieved technological breakthroughs and material solutions to solve the durability of solid-state batteries, and is expected to achieve a range of 1200 kilometers for electric vehicles with solid-state batteries, and the charging time will be reduced to 10 minutes or less. Toyota said it will achieve small-scale mass production of all-solid-state batteries by 2025 and take the lead in hybrid models, start producing solid-state batteries for electric vehicles by 2027, gradually achieve large-scale production of solid-state batteries from 2027 to 2028, and achieve sustained and stable production of Toyota all-solid-state batteries by 2030.\nIn addition, Toyota will adopt integrated die-casting technology on pure electric vehicles that will be put on the market in 2026 to improve the cost competitiveness of pure electric vehicles, thereby boosting sales. It is worth mentioning that Toyota will also consider applying the technology to models other than pure electric vehicles, which can significantly reduce the number of parts and production processes by embedding large body parts integrated with aluminum casting equipment.\nAs more and more automakers cut prices in the Chinese market, Toyota's dominant position in the era of internal combustion engines is threatened. Although Toyota has invested tens of billions of yuan in electrification, however, due to the ability of intelligent cockpit and high-end smart driving, the performance of Volkswagen electric vehicle market is far below expectations. It is urgent to accelerate the local research and development of intelligence and electrification and strengthen the competitiveness of the Chinese market.\nIn the era of internal combustion engines, it is very difficult for Chinese local car companies to gain recognition from international car companies, and the technology they have accumulated in engines, gearboxes and so on is enough for us to learn for decades. In the era of electrification, domestic electric cars began to lead the entire automobile industry, and joint venture brands collapsed rapidly, making international car companies have to compromise and begin to cooperate with domestic brands or buy technology, which may be their only way out.\nA few days ago, the German Volkswagen Group announced that it would take a stake in Xiaopeng Motors. The two sides plan to jointly develop two electric models of the Volkswagen brand for the medium-sized car market in China. The first model is scheduled to enter the market in 2026. It is understood that the two pure electric models will be jointly developed based on Xiaopeng G9's electric vehicle platform and software. Xiaopeng will contribute the vehicle platform as well as intelligent cockpit and intelligent driving system, while Volkswagen will provide the world's leading engineering and supply chain capabilities.\nWelcome to subscribe to the WeChat public account \"Automotive Industry Focus\" to get the first-hand insider information on the automotive industry and talk about things in the automotive circle. Welcome to break the news! WeChat ID autoWechat\nOn March 2, Chery Holdings Group (hereinafter referred to as \"Chery Group\") released the latest monthly sales figures.

The cumulative sales volume from January to February was 348019, up 69.5% from a year earlier. Chery Holdings\nRecently, affected by the previous illegal incidents such as data fraud, the sales of Dafa cars decreased significantly in February. Data show that Daihatsu sold just over 9000 vehicles in Japan in February, down 82 per cent from the same period last year. Relevant data show that Daihatsu earlier made small-engine cars in Japan.\nOn the evening of March 1, Xiaopeng's official Weibo post responded to the \"Xiaopeng P7 Suzhou accident\". Xiaopeng Automobile said: \"at 07:52 on February 29, 2024, a Xiaopeng P7 traffic accident occurred in Wujiang District, Suzhou City, Jiangsu Province. We express great pain for the casualties caused by the accident.\"\nOn March 2, Changan Automobile issued an official statement to clarify the incident of \"spontaneous combustion as soon as the vehicle left the 4S store\". Changan Automobile said in a statement that Changan Automobile was concerned that some online media forwarded videos of Changan users and made false reports under the title of \"spontaneous combustion\" and \"just out of 4S store.\" Now, according to the circumstances of the incident,\nAccording to the national enterprise credit information publicity system, industrial and commercial changes have taken place in Dongfeng Motor Co., Ltd., Zhu Yanfeng stepped down as legal representative and chairman, and Yang Qing took over. At the same time, a number of managers of the company also changed. According to the data, Dongfeng Motor Co., Ltd. was established in May 2003 with a registered capital of 16.\nIn the early morning of September 18, Evergrande Group, which is at the forefront of the wind and waves, made a sudden announcement. Evergrande Group said in the announcement that as of May 1, 2021, the then Evergrande Group headquarters, the executive assistant to the president of each industrial group, the chairman and general manager of the provincial company of the real estate group, and the then deputy general manager of Evergrande Wealth, a total of 44 people held 58 investment products of Evergrande Wealth. During the period from May 1 to September 7, among the above-mentioned scope managers, 9 of the above-mentioned scope managers had 9 investment products due for normal payment, 9 new subscriptions for 13 investment products, and 6 redemptions of 12 investment products in advance; as of September 8.\nAccording to sources, it is expected that by 2022, FAW-Volkswagen will put into production a new generation of EA211 1.5T Evo engines at the Chengdu engine plant. At that time, Suiteng, golf and other models will be equipped with this engine, and the existing 1.4T engine will be gradually replaced. The newly built 1.5T engine has many new technologies, such as plasma cylinder wall coating, electronically controlled cooling module, turbocharger with VTG, ACT evo cylinder passivation and so on. Although the power parameters have not been improved, under the condition of ensuring the power, through optimization, the fuel consumption of the car is reduced, the emission rate of harmful substances is reduced, and the steam.\nGeely news is very frequent in recent days, new models emerge one after another, and Geely's new car Geely Xing Yue will be officially launched tonight. Geely Xingyue positioning compact coupe SUV, based on CNA modular platform, and uses black car logo for the first time, will provide ordinary version and sports version for consumers to choose from. In terms of appearance, Geely Star adopts Geely's latest family design, the front face uses a ripple design, and the forward air grille design is very recognizable and unforgettable.

{"text":"The constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) and the pregnane X receptor (PXR) are activated by a variety of endogenous and exogenous ligands, such as steroid hormones, bile acids, pharmaceuticals, and environmental, dietary, and occupational chemicals. In turn, they induce phase I-III detoxification enzymes and transporters that help eliminate these chemicals. Because many of the chemicals that activate CAR and PXR are environmentally-relevant (dietary and anthropogenic), studies need to address whether these chemicals or mixtures of these chemicals may increase the susceptibility to adverse drug interactions. In addition, CAR and PXR are involved in hepatic proliferation, intermediary metabolism, and protection from cholestasis. Therefore, activation of CAR and PXR may have a wide variety of implications for personalized medicine through physiological effects on metabolism and cell proliferation; some beneficial and others adverse. Identifying the chemicals that activate these promiscuous nuclear receptors and understanding how these chemicals may act in concert will help us predict adverse drug reactions (ADRs), predict cholestasis and steatosis, and regulate intermediary metabolism. This review summarizes the available data on CAR and PXR, including the environmental chemicals that activate these receptors, the genes they control, and the physiological processes that are perturbed or depend on CAR and PXR action. This knowledge contributes to a foundation that will be necessary to discern interindividual differences in the downstream biological pathways regulated by these key nuclear receptors.","metadata":{"date":1708954130000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947474660.32\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240226130305-20240226160305-00398.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9193963408,"token_count":302,"url":"https:\/\/eurekaselect.com\/article\/40244"},"score":3,"id":"190"}
{"text":"Dentists talk a lot about brushing, flossing, and regular checkups, but did you know that what you eat can also affect your oral health? Obviously, foods loaded with sugar and starch can have a negative impact, but there are also foods that can have a positive impact. Today we\u2019d like to mention just a few of those so you can consider making them a more regular part of your diet.\nMilk, cheese, and yogurt\nDairy items like these are a source of calcium, an important mineral for your teeth and bones. Dairy items like these also contain casein, which provide natural protection from cavities.\nNutritious foods, like fruits, vegetables, and nuts\nFoods like carrots and celery can be beneficial because they require more chewing. That leads to more saliva in the mouth. Saliva is known for its ability to neutralize acid, preventing cavities from forming.\nOther foods\u2014like garlic, apples, grapes, cocoa and nutmeg\u2014are also believed to beneficial. They make it more difficult for cavity-causing bacteria to cling to teeth.\nRaisins, meanwhile, contains important antioxidants that can help patients fight the bacteria responsible for inflammation and gum disease.\nWater and Tea\nDrinks like water and tea have benefits for different reasons. Water helps keep teeth clean, and it keeps the mouth moisturized, minimizing bad breath and the development of cavities. Tea, on the other hand, contains antioxidants and polyphenols that limit the body\u2019s inflammatory response and the growth of bacteria\nDo you have questions about these or other foods? Dr. Ann Bonness and Dr. Richard Bonness of Bonness Family Dentistry would be happy to help. What you eat can make a serious difference in your oral health.

{"text":"The drumstick tree, also known as Moringa oleifera, is a tree that predominantly grows in tropical and subtropical regions with a steppe climate. People also refer to it as the \u2018miracle tree\u2019 due to the high nutritional value and medicinal properties of its leaves and fruits. In South Africa, for example, the leaves are used to combat malnutrition. Because of these properties, Moringa oleifera is cultivated on a large scale on plantations.\nMoringa oleifera thrives best in dry sandy soil and is highly resistant to drought, leading to rapid tree growth. Originally, this plant is found in the hills on the southern side of the Himalayas in Northwest India. However, nowadays, Moringa oleifera is also cultivated on plantations spread across Africa, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Mexico, the Philippines, Central and South America, and Sri Lanka.\nThis tree is generally considered the most useful tree in the world because almost every part of it can be used for food or other practical purposes.\nThe immature, green fruits of the tree are primarily used, especially in South and Southeast Asia, where they are often incorporated into various dishes. The seeds of matured fruits can be eaten like nuts or peas, and vegetable oil, called behen oil, can be extracted from these seeds (38 to 40%).\nThe flowers of the tree are edible when cooked, and the root can be ground and used as a flavoring agent.\nThe leaves of the tree are particularly nutritious, with high levels of beta-carotene, vitamin C, protein, iron, and potassium. These leaves can be cooked like spinach or dried and ground to be added to meals.\nDue to its pronounced nutritional value, Moringa oleifera is increasingly used to combat malnutrition in developing countries. Various organizations, including Save the Children, the Hunger Organization, and Volunteer Partnerships for West Africa, utilize this tree for this purpose.\nThe seeds of Moringa oleifera have the ability to purify water by removing up to 98 percent of impurities and microorganisms from water. Additionally, the leaves and fruits are processed into medicines, and the leaves are also used to make tea.","metadata":{"date":1708889633000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947474641.34\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240225171204-20240225201204-00799.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9439557195,"token_count":459,"url":"https:\/\/kuwi.org.uk\/trees\/moringa-oleifera\/"},"score":4,"id":"197"}
{"text":"\u201cFeatherston Camp is perhaps the most important surviving First World War-related site in New Zealand...\u201d\nFrom Featherston Military Training Camp and the First World War, 1915-27 by Tim Shoebridge.\nAn exhibition about Featherston Military Training Camp in the Wairarapa tells a story that is of national importance. An estimated 60,000 men trained at the camp between 1916 and 1918 \u2013 a majority of the roughly 100,000 New Zealanders who served overseas during World War One. It was the largest training camp in Australasia. The camp was a living embodiment of the New Zealand military establishment, charged with turning raw recruits into real soldiers. To that end camp authorities had the heavy responsibility of not only putting soldiers through a rigorous training regime, but of ensuring that they were cared for physically, mentally and spiritually. Hard lessons had been learned from the organisation of other camps such as Trentham. Keenly aware that the war was going to last much longer than previously thought, the military was eager to show New Zealand that it took the preparation of the nation\u2019s soldiers seriously. Featherston Camp was a model of military organisation and efficiency, aiming to provide the best possible training for soldiers leaving to fight overseas. Behind the facts, figures and official information lie the soldiers\u2019 tales and experiences. What was it like to live at Featherston Camp? How did camp life compare to home-life? What activities made camp life difficult or enjoyable? What became of some of those who passed through Featherston Camp on their way to war? What is the camp\u2019s legacy and how can we remember it today? What part did Featherston Military Training Camp play in the life of your\/my relative? The exhibition is planned to open on 23 January 2016 \u2013 100 years since the camp became operational.\nToday Featherston Camp is a registered Heritage New Zealand Category 1 Historic Place and is part of a landscape of military training sites which extends from the Hutt Valley to the Wairarapa. Featherston Military Training Camp has outstanding importance as the site of one of New Zealand\u2019s few military training camps which, together with Trentham in Upper Hutt, trained the majority of embarked forces during World War One.\nThe camp is also historically significant for the high number of deaths associated with the influenza pandemic of 1918, which was particularly devastating among soldiers accommodated in crowded military camps. The site has international significance as the primary training location of New Zealand soldiers who fought and died during the liberation of France and Belgium, and on account of the memorials dedicated to the lives of Japanese prisoners of war (1942-1945). There is high community esteem for this place which is historically important to the identity of Featherston, and has stimulated many publications and a variety of media.\nThis exhibition has been made possible by generous support from Lottery World War One Commemorations, Environment and Heritage Committee, Lands Trust Masterton, Eastern & Central Community Trust, South Wairarapa District Council, Trust House, the Friends of Aratoi, Aratoi Foundation and Greytown Trust Lands Trust.\nDeveloped by Aratoi and Wairarapa Archive, Masterton.","metadata":{"date":1709005313000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947474670.19\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240227021813-20240227051813-00799.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9730491638,"token_count":652,"url":"https:\/\/www.aratoi.org.nz\/exhibitions\/2016-01\/featherston-camp-1916-2016-record-remarkable-achievement"},"score":3,"id":"198"}

{"text":"Drills to increase Cadence?\n(Arlington Heights, IL USA)\nEverywhere I've read mentions that the \"ideal\" stride rate for a runner is between 180 and 190 steps per minute. Also, I've had coaches and friends tell me my stride is too long, and that I bounce too much. I've read that a too long stride rate can contribute to bouncing too much.\nWhen I count my stride rate, I'm pretty much locked in at 160 per minute. I'm 44 and have been running since the age of 16. During a 1\/2 Marathon race last weekend, I counted my cadence a few times during the race and it was between 160 and 164 each time. Even doing interval work I've counted my cadence and I can't get above this 160-164 barrier.\nCan you recommend any drills to help increase my stride rate?\nTomAnswer by Dominique:\nThanks for your running training question about increasing stride rate. Great picture again of you and your son!\nYou are right, the usual number quoted is 180 - 190 steps per minute. Elite runners will have that stride rate. Us mere mortals usually have a lower stride rate.\nChanging your stride rate is pretty tough, because you will need to change your natural way of moving\n. And you have been running in a certain way for the past 30 years, probably your whole life, so you need to understand that it will take a few frustrating months or even more to develop a faster stride rate.\nA good exercise to increase your stride rate is to do quick short strides\nafter each run. You could make them bursts of about 30 metre each in which you take very quick steps. Try to lift your knees up high and make those legs move as fast as you can. Repeat at least ten times in a session.\nAnother exercise is to run with a metronome\n. I used one when I was playing the guitar in a former life. I had to practice a piece with another guy. We studied separate from eachother most of the time, but we each used a metronome which dictated how fast we should play to make sure we were studying it at the same pace.\nSo run with the metronome and set it to 180 bpm and then try to keep up with it. This can be fairly frustrating and exhausting in the beginning. What can be easier is to not start with 180 bpm but say 166 bpm. Once you have done that a number of training sessions and you are getting used to that, go to 170 bpm, etc.\nYou can pick one up at your local music store at about $15 - $25.\nI have to warn you: this type of training can be rewarding, but also extremely frustrating. It will take a decent period for you to adjust your stride rate.\nAlso see this page about running cadence\nBest of luck.","metadata":{"date":1709019370000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947474671.63\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240227053544-20240227083544-00898.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9713620543,"token_count":594,"url":"https:\/\/www.best-running-tips.com\/drills-to-increase-cadence.html"},"score":2,"id":"201"}

{"text":"The Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act of 1988, is an act which protects employees from mass layoffs. Not only employees but their families and communities, from multiple situations. These situations can include mass layoffs and planned closings. The warning has to be issued 60 calendar days in advance. This is because the individuals affected by the layoffs have to be able to plan around it. It is a U.S. labour law, which is designed to safeguard workers. The legislation mandated 60-day notice aids employees. It allows the employees to prepare for the workforce changes. Covered businesses with 100 or more full-time employees (excluding full-time employees) are required to notify their workforce.\nThere are multiple elements which constitute the WARN Act. All of the elements ensure that employees have ample time to react, and employers stay proactive:\nThere are multiple exemptions to the WARN Act. They serve as counters, where the use of the WARN act will not be available. The 60-day notice might also not be applicable, reducing it to a couple of days, or none. The exemptions include unforeseeable business circumstances and natural disasters. Some of these circumstances might include drastic market changes because of natural disasters, and other reasons. Employers might also be exempt from the notice requirement. This is only if the circumstances leading to layoffs are sudden and unavoidable. Triggering events, such as plant closures or mass layoffs exceeding the threshold, create the need for a notice. Certain conditions allow for exemptions based on the nature of the event.\nGovernment guidance is essential when it comes to the WARN Act. It is important because employees need to have an adequate amount of time to be able to consider job opportunities. The U.S. Department of Labor offers guidance to employers on applying for exemptions. They indicate that employers should seek clarification from relevant authorities. They do this with legal requirements. This emphasizes the importance of exemptions within the framework of the act itself.\nWARN stands for The Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (of 1988).\nIt is an act which protects employees from mass layoffs and gives employees a 60-day notice.\nWorkplaces with over 100 full-time employees, fall under the WARN Act applicability.","metadata":{"date":1709188547000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947474784.33\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240229035411-20240229065411-00299.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9545827508,"token_count":447,"url":"https:\/\/www.zimyo.com\/resources\/hr-glossary\/warn-act-meaning-and-definition\/"},"score":3,"id":"207"}

The artist\u2019s face is the focal point and the most important part of the painting. As you see, the under-painting already portrays the sitter\u2019s face and we can now continue with the second intermediate layer, which is called the \u201cdead color.\u201d The \u201cDead Color\u201d layer is so named because at this stage the painting will be progressing in cold, light blue colors. This technique is quite popular in fine art practice and has been used for a number of centuries, starting from tempera painting and finding its continuation in oil painting.\nThis preparatory layer is required for achieving great effects. When warm layers of paint are placed on top of the Dead Color, causing them to mix optically with the underlying colder colors, they will create nuances that are unachievable by any other means. You can use white paint in combination with French Ultramarine and a very small amount of an earth color such as Vandyke Brown or Raw Umber.\nWhen the dead colors are painted over the under-painting, a thicker layer is applied for the light areas and a thinner layer is applied for darker places. For the darkest places you can even leave the brown under-painting showing through the dead color. To create the shadows of the face, you may reduce the amount of white color and use a mix of French Ultramarine with Vandyke Brown to make shadows darker. Keep dark places semi-transparent using a thinner like Turpentine or Liquine.\nThe main advantage of using dead color is that you are doing monochromatic painting without worrying at all about the colors of the face. The main task at this stage is to decide on all shapes of the face and make it look three-dimensional by using a very limited palette of cold oil paints.\nYou may be confused about why we need to paint the face at least three times \u2013 we first make an under-painting in brown color, then cover it over with cold dead colors, and then finally continue with the warm colors of the real face.\nYes, it takes time to go through all these stages; however, by doing it this way you will have much greater control of the face colors and shapes. At the end, you will achieve effects of skin transparency and realism that are not possible by other techniques like alla-prima or by just using under-painting and warm colors.\nGlazing with warm thin layers on top of the dead colors will provide the depth and transparency that old masters were so good at.\nThe human body has interesting visual characteristics. For example, the skin gets its color from the blood moving through arteries and veins. Oxygen-rich blood running through millions of arteries gives the flesh-pink tone to the skin and oxygen-poor blood returning to the heart via the veins has a colder color. The combination of both types of blood results in the overall skin tone that is so difficult to portray in oil. Old masters, through generations of trial and error, found the way to trick the human eye was to optically mix cold dead colors with warm glazing over top to depict the realistic appearance of the human body.\nNeedless to say, such an intricate technique is only required for the human body. Other objects on this painting are done well in a simplified way, using under-painting with color layers on top and a finishing glazing. A thicker layer of light cold paint goes on the lightest areas of the face. The flat, soft, long-haired brush can be used to spread the paint from light to darker areas. A soft transition can be done just with a dry brush. You can periodically wipe it off to continue the transition from light to darker places. When the cold dead color is complete and dry we can proceed to the full color of the portrait.\nIt\u2019s better to start from the darkest places on the face, where there are shadows. Using a small round brush, we work on places around the eyes and nose. We follow with a dry brush, making a mechanical transition from dark to lighter places.\nThe same cold dead color technique is used for the sitter\u2019s hands. Starting with a cold mix of white and blue colors, we are shaping the hands and creating lights and shadows. The technique is identical for hands and face because the lightning conditions are very similar.","metadata":{"date":1708810586000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947474569.64\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240224212113-20240225002113-00199.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9276510477,"token_count":1007,"url":"https:\/\/oldmasters.academy\/old-masters-academy-art-lessons\/figure-with-a-still-life-in-oils-painting-a-portrait-in-grisaille"},"score":3,"id":"209"}
{"text":"There was a real possibility that the U.S. Supreme Court would put the latest challenge to the Affordable Care Act on a fast track, setting the stage for a major ruling ahead of this year's presidential election. As NBC News reported this morning, however, the justices punted the case, which is a move with considerable political implications.\nTuesday's brief Supreme Court order does not indicate whether the court intends to hear the case, after the normal time for the opposing sides to submit their legal briefs, or allow it to continue working its way through the lower court appeals.\nBut even if the justices do decide to take it up, the case would not be heard until the court's next term, which begins in October and any decision would not come until after Election Day on Nov. 3.\nFor those who may need a refresher, at issue is a lawsuit from state Republican officials -- with the enthusiastic support of the Trump administration -- who are arguing that \"Obamacare\" must be torn down in its entirety because Congress gutted the ACA's individual mandate in late 2017. By Republicans' reasoning, this provision was so integral to the reform law that the nation's health care system can't function without it.\nTheir argument, of course, is belied by the fact that the Affordable Care Act appears to be working just fine, even after federal GOP lawmakers effectively scrapped it more than two years ago.\nNevertheless, a Texas judge ruled in Republicans' favor in 2018, insisting that the entire law, its benefits, and its protections must cease to be. The 5th Circuit, in a move that appeared awfully political, recently left the future of the nation's health care system in limbo, sending the case back to the district court, urging the conservative jurist to see if any elements of the law could be salvaged.\nThe ACA's proponents asked the U.S. Supreme Court to take up the case, and earlier this month, the justices directed the Trump administration and Republican state officials behind the lawsuit to respond.\nAs NBC News' Pete Williams explained at the time, \"Such a highly abbreviated timeline -- the rules normally allow a month for filing a response -- gives the court the option to take up the case during its current term, which would mean a ruling on a contentious issue this spring, just as the presidential campaign heats up.\"\nToday, the justices effectively closed that door, delaying any future consideration.\nFor Republicans, this was probably the ideal political outcome. If the high court heard the appeal and ruled in the ACA's favor before voters went to the polls, it would've handed Donald Trump and his allies an embarrassing election-year defeat. If the high court heard the case and tore down the nation's health care system, it would've been even worse for Trump, as tens of millions of families came to terms with the loss of coverage, protections, and related benefits thanks to a lawsuit the White House championed.\nNo can say with certainty how the case will eventually be resolved, but in light of this morning's announcement, the answer will come after Election Day, not before.\nMORE: Today's Maddowblog","metadata":{"date":1708958717000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947474660.32\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240226130305-20240226160305-00399.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9647182822,"token_count":635,"url":"https:\/\/www.msnbc.com\/rachel-maddow-show\/maddowblog\/election-year-implications-supreme-court-punts-aca-case-n1120981?icid=previouspost_top"},"score":0,"id":"210"}
{"text":"Pathogens and parasites are the hidden players of many of nature\u2019s most bizarre and beautiful patterns and processes. For example, the extraordinary levels of plant animal biodiversity we find in the tropics is thought to be due, at least in part to the high levels of disease and natural enemies we find in those environments. Similarly, the medical community and casual observers are often fascinated by the boom and bust cycles seen in disease epidemics. How does disease spread so quickly through some populations but not others? What about certain habitats keeps the rate of new infections low? Well, PhD student Maja \u0160ljivar (Figure 1) and her advisor, Dr. Spencer Hall (see Lab website), are interested in these types of questions, but maybe from an angle you haven\u2019t thought of before.\nMaja\u2019s research focuses on how food web structures affect the rates, processes, and outcomes of disease. We often think of food webs in some kind of stepwise order: example, phytoplankton get their energy from the sun and are eaten by zooplankton, who are eaten by tiny fish, who are then eaten by bigger fish, etc. However, have you ever stopped to wonder what happens when a pathogen or parasite attacks the zooplankton? It\u2019s not really consuming or eating the tiny marine creatures, but it still changes the rules of the game. The Hall Lab tackles these questions by studying the (surprisingly) adorable water flea, Daphnia dentifera (Figure 2).\nEvery fall, in freshwater lakes throughout the Midwest, a terrible fungal-plague sweeps through Daphnia populations, filling up these tiny translucent creatures with deadly fungal spores until the host bursts, releases the spores back into the water, and dies. How does this terrible plague happen you ask? You see Daphnia normally consume tiny algae found in freshwater lakes. As the Daphnia float along sucking up algae in order to grow to adulthood and then make new baby Daphnia, they also unintentionally eat fungal spores dispersed in the water, thus becoming infected hosts. However, the Daphnia and algae are not the only players in this food web. Chaoborus is a midge (type of small fly) and predator of Daphnia. Conventional wisdom specifies that predators tend to eat the weakest or sickest prey \u2013 think lions eating sick gazelles, or wolves eating deer. Under the conventional wisdom scenario, predators preferentially consume infected hosts, thus reducing the net prevalence of disease and the size of epidemics. Yet this is not what Maja has found to be the case in the algae-Daphnia\u2013Chaoborus food web. Critically, her research shows that when you have high predator densities of Chaoborus, which does not preferentially eat sick hosts (i.e., Chaoborus is a non-selective predator), the size of epidemics is much higher.\nThe reason for this is directly related to classic food web theory: more predators, equals fewer prey, which leads to an increase in the resources (i.e., algae) the prey consume. And, because there are fewer Daphnia dining at the algae buffet, they wind up consuming more algae as well as more fungal spores. The net outcome leads to higher loads of fungal spores reproducing in the tiny Daphnia bodies and a higher dispersion back into the lake. Larger epidemics can be the result of higher predator densities, when that predator is a non-selective consumer of the host-prey.\nTiny Daphnia floating around in freshwater lakes and food web theory may seem only tangentially related to our daily lives, but believe it or not, these questions can also connect to human health. How predators influence disease and epidemics depends on the other members of their habitat and food web system. As a final example, Maja pointed me towards a recent scientific study on schistosomiasis, which is considered a neglected tropical disease infecting more than 200 million people. The parasitic worm that causes the disease first infects freshwater snails (intermediate host) before infecting humans (the secondary host) through the skin. In the mid-1980\u2019s, the construction of a dam on the Senegal River removed the predators (prawns) of the intermediate snail hosts, which ultimately caused massive increases in both the snail population and rates of infection in villages along the river. This food web has multiple interacting players: worms, snails, predators, humans. Fortunately, researchers have recently shown that reintroducing prawn predators back into the system, combined with preventative drug treatments in susceptible humans, could eliminate schistosomiasis from these sites (Sokolow et al. 2015, 2017).\nSo the next time you think about birds eating worms, seals eating fish, or Chaoborus eating Daphnia, take a second to ponder the hidden pathogens and parasites of our world. These tiny organisms have the power to bring both the consumer and the consumed to their knees.","metadata":{"date":1708873663000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947474617.27\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240225135334-20240225165334-00698.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.941960752,"token_count":1044,"url":"https:\/\/blogs.iu.edu\/sciu\/2017\/08\/08\/whos-eating-who\/"},"score":3,"id":"211"}

{"text":"The Language of Flowers\nShare This Video\nDavid Kithcart [reporting]: So you\u2019ve decided to get flowers for your special somebody for Valentine\u2019s Day. It\u2019s a good idea. But what color do you get? What kind do you get? Does it matter? There\u2019s a lot to chose from. At Norfolk Wholesale Floral, Sandy knows a thing or two about the unspoken \"language of flowers\".\nKithcart: Sandy, now everybody knows that red roses are the favorite for people to give on Valentine's, but you have a lot of different flowers in here. Tell me something about what these mean.\nSandy: We have the red roses which mean love. You would want to send these to somebody that you\u2019re definitely in love with.\nKithcart: And you know that they\u2019re in love with you.\nSandy: Yes. So we have the love. Then we have yellow tulips, which mean hopelessly in love. The reason why the flowers have the meanings is: back in Victorian times, they weren\u2019t able to express these emotions in words. So they would use flowers as their language to tell what they were feeling for someone.\nKithcart: So it was more of a genteel time.\nSandy: Yes. They actually selected certain flowers to say what they wanted them to say... We have red carnations. They mean admiration, so you also admire them.\nKithcart [reporting]: The stargazer lilly represents ambitious love.\nKithcart: So would that mean that you intend to actually do something about this in terms of marriage or\u2026\nSandy: Yes. Longer commitment\nKithcart [reporting]: Roses, which symbolize love, also have different meanings based on their color and maturity. Red and white roses together stand for unity. White roses represent purity; pink is for happiness, and orange roses signify desire. The traditional meaning of a yellow rose was jealousy, but these days yellow roses symbolize friendship or joy. If the feelings weren\u2019t mutual, flowers were used to communicate that message as well.\nSandy: I wouldn\u2019t give anybody the snapdragon. That means no. So unless you\u2019re angry with somebody, I don\u2019t think I'd give them the snapdragon.\nKithcart: Now how much do people understand all these meanings?\nSandy: Not at all, not at all.\nKithcart: But it would be a nice thing if people knew. Then they gave a person the flower, and they explained what they gave them -- like maybe in a card or something. That gives me an idea about my wife.

{"text":"Growing up, dogs were a huge part of my family, so when I first brought my St. Bernard Harley home, I wanted to give her the best life I possibly could.\nI took Harley everywhere, which meant she was always in my car and made frequent visits to friends and family member\u2019s houses. The problem was people were constantly complaining about her shedding. Dog hair was everywhere, and nobody wanted to ride in my car or hang out at my house, and Harley wasn\u2019t allowed at anyone else\u2019s house. I tried to fix the shedding problem with every product on the market \u2013 from sheets or seat covers in the car to fancy shampoos and grooming products \u2013 nothing worked! That\u2019s when I was inspired to come up with my own solution and create something that was completely different. My mom sewed the first prototype and once Harley started wearing it, people began asking where they could get one for their dog. That\u2019s when I realized there was a huge need for this product. It had so many benefits that I thought if I could make it available to dog owners everywhere, I could help improve the relationship between people and their pets. Our mission is to keep creating products that promote a happy and healthy lifestyle and strengthen the bond between people and their pets. Our mission is to support all animals. See how we Paw it Forward.\nEco-friendly, Lightweight Fabric\nFinding the right fabric was one of the hardest parts of developing the final version of the Shed Defender.\nWe needed something that was lightweight, breathable, stretchy, durable and comfortable all at the same time. After trying dozens and dozens of different materials, I eventually developed Shed-Tex, a proprietary and eco-friendly polyester, spandex athletic mesh fabric that allows the dog to stay cool and comfortable.\nThe best part about our fabric is that it\u2019s made from recycled plastic water bottles! At Shed Defender, we value sustainability because preserving the beaches, parks, mountains and trails that our dogs play in is important to us and our pups. Traditional polyester is an energy-hungry, non-sustainable synthetic fiber so that\u2019s why we started looking for something different.\nThis process of converting PET into recycled polyester uses 33%-53% less energy than developing traditional polyester fabric. With the creation of the Shed-Tex fabric we are reducing our dependence on petroleum and using plastic bottles that would have otherwise ended up in a landfill which reduces soil contamination and air and water pollution.\nAnd an added benefit is that garments created from recycled polyester can be recycled again and again with no degradation of quality so don\u2019t forget to recycle your Shed-Tex Shed Defender so that it can avoid ending up in a landfill!\nDo you make one that will fit my dog?\nThat\u2019s one of the most common questions we get when talking about the Shed Defender or showing it off at events and the answer is always YES! I spent countless hours at animal shelters and dog parks, trying the Shed Defender on dogs of all sizes and shapes. Eventually I created 9 sizes that fit dogs from 5 lbs up to dogs that weigh over 200 lbs!\nBeyond the Shedding: Fostering a Happier and Healthier Lifestyle\nI truly believe that the Shed Defender helped Harley and I spend more quality time together because I was able to bring her in the car, take her to friends and family member\u2019s houses and overall I spent less time worrying about the dog hair and more time having fun with her.\nI knew I wanted other dog lovers to experience these benefits, but to my surprise, shedding was just the beginning! Once I started selling the product, people started sending us emails saying that the Shed Defender has reduced their dog\u2019s anxiety and has helped with a huge variety of medical issues. Instead of the annoying medical cone, people began using it for surgical recovery, hotspots, skin conditions and more. As the brand has grown, so have the use cases. We now have people using the Shed Defender as a way to keep ticks, burrs, stickers and fleas out of the fur. It offers UV protection for hairless dogs or dogs recovering from cancer or other conditions. People like using it to keep dogs clean and countless other reasons!","metadata":{"date":1708886069000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947474641.34\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240225171204-20240225201204-00798.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9719609022,"token_count":878,"url":"https:\/\/sheddefender.com\/pages\/about-us"},"score":1,"id":"215"}

{"text":"The Consolidated XB2Y-1 was a design for a dive bomber produced for the US Navy, but that didn't get past the prototype stage.\nIn 1932 the Navy's Bureau of Aeronautics drew up a specification for a two-seat biplane dive-bomber capable of carrying a 1,000lb bomb (Design No.110). Consolidated's submission was produced by B. Douglas Thomas, whose Thomas-Morse Aircraft company had been purchased by Consolidated in 1929.\nThomas produced a strong biplane, powered by a 700hp Pratt & Whitney Twin Wasp XR-1535-64 fourteen cylinder air cooled radial. The aircraft needed to be able to resist 9G during the pull-out from dives, so the centre section was constructed from a solid steel block (presumably hollowed out to the correct shape). This produced a very strong but also very expensive component. The aircraft had a fixed undercarriage. The lower wing was attached to the base of the fuselage, the upper wing was carried just above it. The crew of two sat in open cockpits behind the wings. The bomb was carried on a trapeze below the fuselage, and as a result it used a split undercarriage.\nThe XB2Y-1 (Consolidated Model 24) was delivered on 28 June 1933. It competed with the Great Lakes XBG-1, a similar biplane. The Great Lakes aircraft won the contest, and eventually 61 were built.\nSoon afterwards Thomas resigned from Consolidated and the Thomas-Morse subsidiary disappeared. Work continued on the XB2Y-1, which was modified into a 'scout' configuration. This involved removing the bomb trapeze and the belly tank and a modification to the cowling.

{"text":"MCO\/EPB graduate student Sriram \u201cSri\u201d Srikant (rising G3, Murray and Gaudet Labs) received a 2013 Howard Hughes Medical Institute International Research Fellowship. His research focuses on understanding the ABC transporters involved in the secretion of mating pheromones in extant fungi. He investigates the functional aspects of these transporters in the context of their structural features and evolutionary history. He is particularly interested in studying Ste6, a protein in yeast that pumps a pheromone out of a budding yeast cell. Ste6 is also a homolog of the multidrug pump that plays an important role in the drug resistance of many tumors. He hopes to maintain this \u201cholistic view of molecular machines\u201d throughout his career.\nSri grew up in Chennai, a metropolis in South India, and completed an undergraduate degree in Chemical Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology Madras (IITM). He entered the Engineering and Physical Biology (EPB) graduate student training program at Harvard. After finishing his rotation, joined the labs of Andrew Murray and Rachel Gaudet in the Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology (MCB) to combine his long-standing interest in structural biology with his more recent enthusiasm for cell biology and evolution. \u201cI was thrilled to immerse myself in the biological sciences as part of EPB and to interact with MCB researchers with diverse perspectives in the struggle to solve the pressing questions of biology.\u201d\n\u201cThe role of the EPB track for the Harvard community is to recognize, encourage and support talented young scientists who have the courage to bridge disciplines across the physical\/engineering and biological sciences divide,\u201d explains Professor Nancy Kleckner, who heads the EPB program. \u201cSriram exemplifies this type of young scientist.

{"text":"DeepMind\u2019s Dreamer AI learns from the past to predict the future\nSome AI systems achieve goals in challenging environments by drawing on representations of the world informed by past experiences. They generalize these to novel situations, enabling them to complete tasks even in settings they haven\u2019t encountered before. As it turns out, reinforcement learning \u2014 a training technique that employs rewards to drive software policies toward goals \u2014 is particularly well-suited to learning world models that summarize an agent\u2019s experience, and by extension to facilitating the learning of novel behaviors.\nResearchers hailing from Google, Alphabet subsidiary DeepMind, and the University of Toronto sought to exploit this with an agent \u2014 Dreamer \u2014 designed to internalize a world model and plan ahead to select actions by \u201cimagining\u201d their long-term outcomes. They say that it not only works for any learning objective, but that Dreamer exceeds existing approaches in data efficiency and computation time as well as final performance.\nThroughout an AI agent\u2019s lifetime, either interleaved or in parallel, Dreamer learns a latent dynamics model to predict rewards from both actions and observations. In this context, \u201clatent dynamics model\u201d refers to a model that\u2019s learned from image inputs and performs planning to gather new experience. The \u201clatent\u201d bit indicates that it relies on a compact sequence of hidden or latent states, which enables it to learn more abstract representations, such as the positions and velocities of objects. Effectively, information from the input images is integrated into the hidden states using an encoder component, after which the hidden states are projected forward in time to anticipate images and rewards.\nAbove: Dreamer completes a pendulum swing task. The middle shows 45-step predictions.\nDreamer uses a multi-part latent dynamics model that\u2019s somewhat complex in structure. A representation bit encodes observations and actions, and a transition bit anticipates states without seeing the observations that will cause them. A third component \u2014 a reward component \u2014 projects the rewards given the model states, and an action model implements learned policies and aims to predict actions that solve imagined environments. Finally, a value model estimates the expected imagined rewards that the action model achieves, while an observation model provides feedback signals.\nAbove: Dreamer navigating a maze. The middle shows 45-step predictions.\nIn a series of experiments, the researchers tested Dreamer on 20 visual control tasks within the DeepMind Control Suite, simulation software for evaluating machine learning-driven agents. They first trained it using an Nvidia V100 graphics chip and 10 processor cores for each training run, which they say took 9 hours per 106 environment steps on the control suite. (That\u2019s compared with the 17 hours it took Google\u2019s PlaNet, a Dreamer predecessor, to reach similar performance.)\nAbove: Dreamer playing an Atari game (Boxing). The middle shows 45-step predictions.\nThey report that Dreamer effectively used learned world models to generalize from small amounts of experience, and that its success demonstrates learning behaviors\nby latent imagination can outperform top methods. They also say that Dreamer\u2019s value model performs well even for short-term planning, outperforming alternative models on 16 of 20 tasks, with 4 ties.\n\u201cFuture research on representation learning can likely scale latent imagination to environments of higher visual complexity,\u201d wrote the researchers, who plan to present their work at NeurIPS 2019 in Vancouver this week.

{"text":"EARTHQUAKES IN JAMAICA ARE INEVITABLE BUT EARTHQUAKE DISASTERS NEED NOT BE?\nUNIT FOR DISASTER STUDIES\nDEPARTMENT OF GEOGRAPHY AND GEOLOGY\nUNIVERSITY OF THE WEST INDIES\nA recurring theme in all of the earthquakes that have affected the parishes of Kingston and St.Andrew since the Port Royal Earthquake of June 7, 1692 is that the earthquake damage is profoundly influenced by the local geological conditions. In other words, during earthquakes it is the underlying geology that determines how strongly the ground will shake, the sites where landslides, liquefaction, ground cracks and fissures may occur, and where fault ruptures are likely.\nThese physical processes have generally accompanied all the significant Jamaican earthquakes to date. An understanding of the ground behaviour therefore assumes a great significance if we wish to minimize economic disruption, damages to infrastructure and property, and loss of lives from future earthquakes. Earthquake risks are quantified on this basis.\nA number of approaches to reduce losses from future earthquakes are available. However, it is not possible for many of the developing countries to reach the level of sophistication that is currently being practiced in such countries as Japan and USA. We believe that the simplest and most inexpensive approach for earthquake loss reduction in Jamaica is to explore a simple principle \"The Past As The Key To The Future\".\nAs geologists we attempt to predict the likelihood of the effects of earthquakes in the years to come on the basis of the distribution of damage and its relation to areas of landslides, liquefaction, ground cracks and fissures, and the site geology.\nThe lessons learned from the previous earthquakes may be used to adopt wise land use policies, institute proper design and construction practices, strengthen weak structures, and design preparedness plans at national, community and family levels. This proactive response should prevent the hazards becoming disasters.\nStephen Taber in his pioneering analysis of Jamaican earthquakes wrote in 1920\".... and it is a general rule that most of the weak shocks of a district originate in the same localities as the stronger ones.\"\nLessons learned from the January 13, 1993 earthquake\nVulnerability of Kingston to seismic shaking was amply demonstrated by the magnitude 5.4 temblor of January 13, 1993.\nAlthough described as a \"moderate\" shock with its epicenter located near the Silver Hill Peak in Portland, some 15km northeast of the Half Way Tree Clock Tower, the effects of this earthquake were felt over an area of approximately 500 square kilometers.\nThe results of a few seconds of ground shaking in eastern Jamaica, with maximum intensities ranging between MMI VII-VIII, were as follows (see Journal of the Geological Society of Jamaica, Volume 30,1996).\n1. Economic losses at J$15,810,000.00\n2. Two known deaths, one as a result of the collapse of a cliff in Portland.\n3. Some 518 families were affected (450 in Kingston and St. Andrew) as their houses were damaged or destroyed.\n4. 7, 871 insurance claims reporting losses of about J$152 million dollars were submitted to the insurance companies, and up to June 1993 claims in the value of J$24 million were settled;\n5. 2% deductible and the conditions of average resulted in many claims being significantly reduced.\n6. Submarine landslides damaged TCSI Digital Cable and Jamaica-Panama Cable; repair costs are not known.\n7. Landslides occurred along the Yallahs Water Pipeline route; rock falls covered wash outs and air valves between Hope River and August Town, Rest Haven and Bull Bay, and Cambridge and Eleven Miles.\n8. A landslide occurred in the limestone quarry located south of the Mona Reservoir; ground fissures on the embankment road on the southern side of the Mona Reservoir. Damage to NWC Water Treatment Plant building.\n9. The Rio Cobre Pipeline in Caymanas Estate was damaged because of liquefaction. Repair costs were estimated at 2 million dollars.\n10. Water mains and pipelines in other areas were affected.\n11. Electricity system responded very well with only few power failures: 39 MW of power, or 7% of installed capacity was lost for approximately 38 minutes; minor damage to buildings and facilities amounting to $4.65 m.\n12. A number of roads were blocked\/damaged as a result of landslides.\n13. The Ministry of Construction budgeted some $2 m. for the clearance of roads.\n14. Liquefaction-related ground cracks were observed in two sections of the north approach road to the Hunts Bay Causeway Bridge.\n15. Significant damage was reported to the buildings of various educational institutions.\n16. Ground cracks and fissures, ground settlements, and landslides were observed at several places causing damage to building, houses and roads.\n17. An abnormally high water discharge was observed at the Rockfort Spring.\n18. The figures available suggest that the direct damage due to the moderate earthquake of January 13, 1993 was in excess of J$ 200 m.\n\"The January 13 event was the tenth Eastern Jamaica Earthquake in the known history (326 years) to have caused intensities of MMI VII and higher\" (Margaret Wiggins-Grandison, 1996) .\nThis earthquake provided an opportunity to study earthquake- induced geological processes and also it was a real test for earthquake preparedness and performance of the lifeline facilities.\nIt appears that many of the lessons taught by the previous\nearthquakes have been forgotten. The pattern of damage and geologic effects observed in 1993 are very similar to those reported in 1692 and 1907. The sites of ground failures related to landslides, liquefaction, and ground cracks and fissures and the associated damage during 1993 comes as no surprise and should serve as a reminder that these processes can affect the same areas in successive earthquakes.\nOur analysis of the geologic signatures of the previous Jamaican earthquakes suggests that any significant earthquake event (magnitude 5.4 and over) to affect the island in future is likely to have an enormous loss\npotential, especially for the purposes of earthquake damage underwriting.\nThe property losses following the January 14, 1907 earthquake were estimated at between 1.5 and 2.5 million pounds (1907 value) and at that time the annual value of Jamaica's export earnings were less than 1.5 million pounds. However, these capital losses were compensated in one form or the other. For example, the British Fire Insurance Companies paid some 85% of the face value of the policies amounting to 1200,000 pounds; the British Parliament provided grants and low-interest loans of some 950,000 pounds (Dr. R. Lobdell, 1993). This type of assistance, however, may no longer be available and a major disaster is likely to set back economic progress considerably.\nThe adverse social, economic, and environmental impacts of the 1988 hurricane Gilbert are still with us. As far\nas earthquake damage scenarios are concerned, Dr. J.F. Tomblin (1976) noted.... \"a repeat of the 1692\nearthquake in Jamaica might cause property damage, at 1975 prices, in excess of J$2,000 million, plus deaths of up to 10% of the population and injuries to a further 20 to 30%, plus near-total disruption of industrial and agricultural production\".\nWhat about the seismic risk for the capital city of Jamaica? In short, both the citizenry and the elected and appointed officials of the state should seriously consider the analysis of Dr. John B. Shepherd (1971) - \"From the\nseismologists point of view the parishes of Kingston including Port Royal, and lower St. Andrew were probably the worst possible locations to choose for the capital city of Jamaica.\"\nUnfortunately for Kingstonians, it is not only the seismic hazard that presents them with a risk. They must also deal with hurricanes, landslides, excessive soil erosion, and coastal and riverine flooding. In other words, it is a multiple hazard scenario with strong linkages between the various hazardous phenomena.\nHowever, inspite of all the attendant hazards, risks, and historical disasters (1692 & 1907) people have lived on the Liguanea alluvial fan, Palisadoes tombolo, landslide-prone hills of St. Andrew, marshlands, reclaimed lands, and narrow coastal strips, and will continue to do so, doing the things that they must do in order to earn a living.\nThe Jamaican government bails out the communities which are hit by natural disasters, e.g., following the earthquake of January 13, 1993, the government provided an emergency relief and rehabilitation grant of 1.2 million dollars to the affected communities.\nPeople have built and re-built, often tragically and painfully but at a cost. We keep on paying an invisible \"disaster tax.\"\nThe disastrous effects of an earthquake, or for that matter any natural disaster, are a reflection of how aware a society is of its physical environment and how effective is the policy of prudent landuse.\nWhat should be done?\nThe hazard scenario presented is rather depressing. However, it is always possible to prevent todays hazards in becoming tomorrow's disasters. Earthquake related losses can be minimized if we:\n(a) do not forget that Jamaica is a earthquake-prone country and problems related to this hazard can arise at any time, especially in the Kingston Metropolitan Area which is home to some 700,000 people, and\n(b) take it as a challenge to apply the lessons learned from the previous events in wise landuse, proper design, and preparedness.\nAn escalation in vulnerability to natural disasters is often closely related to urbanization in areas with severe landuse constraints and in many instances some of these areas have been subjected to repeated ground failures during past\nEarth scientists have a key role to play in communicating the scientific knowledge on hazards to the public and other potential users and to help mitigate the effects of future disasters.\n\"We can either proceed vigorously to apply the lessons learned from the (previous) earthquakes or be condemned to relearn them from the next earthquake\".\nI believe that individuals and agencies would take more interest in mitigation if they could somehow be educated about hazards and risks.\n\"Natural Hazards can be terrible tragedies - but they can also be \"terribly\" good opportunities to educate the\nState-of-the-art, GIS-based hazard maps dealing with landslides, earthquakes, flooding, storm surge etc. are now available in the public domain for Kingston and St.Andrew, Clarendon and St.Catherine, South Coast of Jamaica, Portland, and Montego Bay areas.\nInformation on natural hazards and disasters may be obtained free of cost from the following UWI websites\n(1) Unit for Disaster Studies\n(2) Caribbean Disaster Information Network(CARDIN)\nThose interested in learning about natural hazards and disasters in the Caribbean may read UWI Dept. of Geography and Geology four- week Summer Course:\nAnalysis and Management of Geohazards and Risks\noffered in the months of June-July.\nBLO 20010613 - - - COMMENTS ? - - - Table of Contents\n< From: \"Rafi Ahmad\" <email@example.com>\nTo: \"Ben Oostdam\" <firstname.lastname@example.org>\nSubject: Fw: Article on earthquake preparedness.\nDate: Tue, 12 Jun 2001 20:07:24 -0500","metadata":{"date":1708934383000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947474653.81\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240226062606-20240226092606-00199.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9569357634,"token_count":2390,"url":"https:\/\/www.mona.uwi.edu\/uds\/GEOHAZARDS_2001\/EQprep-20010612b.html"},"score":4,"id":"222"}
{"text":"Selecting the right running shoes is crucial for every runner, but it becomes even more critical for heavy individuals. When it comes to running shoes for heavy men, there are several factors to consider, such as cushioning, stability, support, durability, and fit.\nKeep in mind that the ideal running shoe can vary from person to person based on individual preferences and biomechanics. In this comprehensive discussion, we will delve into these factors, explore some top running shoe options, and provide guidance for heavy runners to make an informed choice.\nCharacteristics that are essential for the proper selection of the best running shoes for heavy men\nCushioning is one of the most important aspects for heavy runners. The extra weight puts more stress on the feet and joints, so adequate cushioning is crucial to absorb shock and reduce the risk of injury.\nLook for shoes with ample cushioning in the midsole, typically made from materials like EVA or gel. Many brands offer varying levels of cushioning, We will do a real review of all those shoes.\nStability is another essential consideration, as heavier runners need more support to maintain proper form. Pronation, the natural inward rolling of the foot, can be more pronounced in heavier individuals. Shoes with stability features, medial posts, or roll bars, help correct overpronation and promote more neutral motion.\nGood arch and ankle support is essential for heavy runners to prevent overpronation and reduce the risk of injuries like plantar fasciitis. Look for shoes with solid heel counters and structured arch support.\nYou can also add orthopedic insoles for extra support. Brands like Saucony and Mizuno offer supportive options that cater to different arch types and foot shapes.\nHeavy runners wear their shoes more and put more stress on the shoes. Thus, durability is crucial. Reinforced outsoles, high-quality materials, and double stitching in high-stress areas are all signs of a durable shoe.\nTrail running shoes, known for their rugged construction, can be a good option for heavy runners who want more longevity in their shoes.\nProper fit is always important, but it\u2019s even more critical for heavy runners. Improper footwear can cause various problems such as blisters, hot spots, and discomfort. Consider measuring your feet and choosing shoes that provide ample space in the toe box.\nWhile lightweight shoes are popular for racing, heavier individuals might benefit from slightly heavier shoes. These offer more cushioning and support. However, Shoe weight is a matter of personal preference, so it\u2019s a good idea to try different options.

{"text":"If you're at the farmer's market and come across an abundance of fresh beets, make this beet kvass recipe. You only need a handful of ingredients and a little effort.\nWithin a few days, you\u2019ll have a deeply nourishing tonic. The earthy, lightly sour, and faintly sweet flavor is an acquired taste. But you\u2019ll find yourself craving it before long.\nWhat is beet kvass?\nBeet kvass is a fermented drink with roots in Eastern Europe. Its flavor tastes similar to beet juice - earthy, sour, and slightly salty. As beet kvass ferments, the beets release their pigments which gives the kvass a vibrant pink-red color.\nWhy this recipe works\nBeet kvass is easy to make, and you only need a few ingredients.\nIt\u2019s also affordable since beets tend to be a thrifty purchase at the supermarket.\nBeet kvass is a powerhouse of antioxidants combined with beneficial bacteria and wild yeast.\nYou can easily adjust the flavor, adding ginger, dill, or other herbs and spices to make something uniquely your own.\nAt its most basic, this beet kvass recipe needs only a few ingredients: beets, salt, and water. You can add a starter culture, such as kombucha or sauerkraut juice, as well as spices to the three ingredients.\n- Beets are central to this recipe. You can use any kind of beet you like, including red, golden, or candy-striped Chioggia beets.\n- Salt gives the kvass a little flavor. For the best flavor, look for minimally processed and additive-free salt such as sea salt.\n- Starter culture is traditionally used to make bread kvass, of which beet kvass is a variation. While it\u2019s an optional ingredient, it can speed up fermentation and make a reliable brew.\n- Filtered water is optimal for fermentation since it will not contain chlorine.\n- Herbs and spices can add interest and flavor to your beet kvass. Ginger, garlic, dill, black pepper, turmeric, and allspice are all popular additions.\nHow to Make Beet Kvass\n- Prepare your beets by scrubbing them well to remove any dirt or debris. Then leave the peel on, dice them, and dump them into a quart-sized jar.\n- Prepare a brine by mixing salt, starter culture, and water together. Pour this over the beets.\n- Seal the jar tightly. A tight-fitting fermentation lid that allows excess gas created during fermentation to escape without allowing more oxygen in works well. If you don\u2019t have one, a mason jar lid is fine, but remember to burp the jar from time to time.\n- Wait about a week. Fermented drinks will ferment faster in a hot kitchen than in a cold one. So you may need to adjust your timing depending on the temperature of your home.\n- Strain and serve.\nBeet kvass is simple to make at home. And you only need a few ingredients: beets, salt, and water. Using a starter culture can be helpful, too, and results in greater palatability and faster fermentation.\nWhen you make this recipe, there are a few things you want to keep in mind.\n- Use an airlock lid or a very tight seal. That prevents oxygen from flowing into your kvass. Accordingly, it lowers the chance of mold contamination.\n- Use beets with the peel on, but rinse them well. The beet skin can be a good source of lactic acid-producing bacteria. In other words, those are the bacteria you need for proper fermentation.\n- Pay attention to your water. Tap water can contain chlorine or chloramine which are antiseptics intended to keep drinking water safe; however, they can inhibit proper fermentation. So, use filtered water or allow your tap water to sit out so the chlorine will evaporate before using it for fermentation.\n- Foam and bubbles are a normal part of fermentation. If you see bubbles forming, that's a great sign that fermentation is underway.\n- If your beet kvass becomes viscous, start over. Sometimes beets and other high-sugar vegetables like carrots produce a viscous texture when fermented. That just means your beet kvass fermented a little too long.\n- Give your kvass more time in the winter, less in the summer. Fermentation speeds up in warm temperatures and slows down in cold temperatures. So it will need less time in summer, and more in winter.\nWays to Use Beet Kvass\nAt its heart, beet kvass is a fermented, probiotic tonic. So just pour it over ice and drink about \u00bc cup at a time. You can also dilute it with sparkling water if the flavor is too intense or earthy for your liking.\nThanks to both its acidity and brininess, it makes an excellent addition to salad dressings. Next time you make a dressing, use it in place of the vinegar.\nFor similar reasons, it\u2019s also delicious swirled into soup - especially borscht and root vegetable soup. The acidity of beet kvass helps to balance the soup\u2019s sweet, earthy flavors.\nUsing a Starter Culture\nIf you haven\u2019t brewed many fermented drinks, you may be unfamiliar with starter cultures. These are sources of beneficial bacteria and yeast. They help speed up fermentation and create an acidic environment.\nFermented drinks with live cultures, such as kombucha, jun tea, and water kefir, work well as starter cultures for drinks. Beneficial bacteria are well-established in these cultures and will kickstart your kvass.\nNatural sources of yeast, such as wild yeast or ginger bug work great for beet kvass.\nJuice from fermented vegetables is a source of beneficial bacteria and lactic acid. Juice from homemade sauerkraut can be a particularly nice starter for this beet kvass recipe.\nVariations + Substitutions\nTry golden beets, orange peel, and ginger. Beets are a natural match for citrus and ginger, and the combination is lovely.\nAdd garlic and dill. If you\u2019re a fan of sour pickles or pickle juice, you\u2019ll love this combination of garlic, dill, and beets.\nTry black pepper, cinnamon sticks, and allspice. They make a nice, spiced brew that\u2019s especially good for winter months.\nTry these fermented drinks next\nWhat does it taste like?\nBeet kvass tastes slightly sweet with earthy undertones, similar to beet juice, only tarter with a salty edge.\nWhat do I do with the leftover beets?\nI recommend composting them. However, many people will eat the leftover beets or brew a second batch of kvass from them. Keep in mind that if you re-use the beets, your tonic will be progressively weaker.\nWhat\u2019s this milky film I see on top of the kvass?\nIf you see a milky or powdery film on top of your kvass, it\u2019s most likely kahm yeast. Kahm yeast is harmless and you can gently skim it off or tilt the jar and pour it off. To prevent it from forming, shake your jar every day.\nDo I have to use salt?\nNo. Traditional Eastern European kvass recipes, including beet kvass, do not call for salt. Rather, they use a hunk of sourdough bread and, often, a starter culture similar sourdough starter to kickstart fermentation. In these recipes, you\u2019ll often see honey or sugar added, too.\nBy contrast, American versions, such as this beet kvass recipe, often include salt (sometimes quite a lot!).\nHow much salt should I use?\nSince salt is not strictly necessary for making kvass as it is for other fermented vegetables, you have some flexibility. For this recipe, we\u2019ve found success in combining a little salt with plenty of starter culture. One teaspoon salt per quart of water seems to be the sweet spot.\nDo I have to use a starter culture?\nNo, but it\u2019s helpful. Traditionally you make kvass with a starter culture similar to sourdough starter or wild yeast. However, if you don\u2019t use a starter culture, consider increasing the salt to 3 teaspoons (about 20 grams).\nAdding a starter helps it ferment faster and more safely, reducing the risk of harmful bacteria or mold.\nWhat do I do if I don\u2019t have fermentation equipment?\nIf you plan to make fermented vegetables frequently, it\u2019s worth picking up the proper equipment. Jars, seals, airlocks, and weights can make fermenting at home a lot easier with less chance of mold formation.\nIf you don\u2019t have them, make it in a mason jar or a Fido jar with a tight-fitting lid. Every day, shake the jar to stop mold and yeast. Every 1-2 days, let out extra gas by burping the jar.\nIs it good for you?\nBoth beets and fermented drinks are functional foods, meaning your body gets greater value out of them than nutrition alone. Thanks to the lacto-fermentation process, it\u2019s full of probiotics. Beets themselves are particularly rich in antioxidants. Accordingly the health benefits of beet kvass are excellent, especially for the heart, liver, and digestive system.\nHow much should I drink every day?\nBeet kvass is a tonic, not a prescription. Drink it from time to time in an amount you enjoy. If you're new to fermented foods, the probiotics might make your stomach feel weird.\nStart with a few tablespoons mixed into water. Then, work your way up to drinking 4 to 6 ounces at a time.","metadata":{"date":1709585108000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947476532.70\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240304200958-20240304230958-00698.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9112024307,"token_count":2107,"url":"https:\/\/nourishedkitchen.com\/beet-kvass-recipe\/"},"score":2,"id":"225"}

The results showed there are six factors that affect the growth of children under five: The father's smoking status, milk formula, breakfast habits, the child's gender, the mother's occupation, and the influence of the mother's knowledge. The most dominant factor affecting children's growth is the habit of breakfast with Prevalence Risk 5.833, which means that toddlers who have no habit have a growth risk of 5.833 times to experience abnormality compared to toddlers who have breakfast habits after controlling for variables such as father smoking status, milk formula, child gender, mother\u2019s occupation, and mother's knowledge.\nFull text article\nAuthors who publish with Jurnal Ilmu Kesehatan Masyarakat (JIKM) agree to the following conditions:\n- The author retains the copyright and gives the editorial board the first right to be published with work that is simultaneously licensed under the Creative Commons Linking License that allows others to share (copy and redistribute) material in the media or format an adaptation of the work for any purpose.\n- Authors can enter into separate additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of published journal works (for example, posting them to institutional repositories or publishing them in books), with recognition of the initial publication of this journal.","metadata":{"date":1709127913000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947474715.58\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240228112121-20240228142121-00798.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9234965444,"token_count":404,"url":"https:\/\/ejournal.fkm.unsri.ac.id\/index.php\/jikm\/article\/view\/1361"},"score":3,"id":"226"}
{"text":"Beef Central, 25\/07\/2023\nFATNESS, or the ability to finish, is often a focal point for many producers in their selection decisions.\nThe role of fatness in a beef herd is often very complex. Fatness has a significant role to play in the management of the breeding herd and in the ability of sale animals to meet market specifications.\nThe deposition of fat in an animal is relatively slow in the early stages of an animal\u2019s life. Once the individual achieves approximately half its physiological maturity, fat deposition starts to increase.\nAs an animal matures, there can be a significant increase in fatness, particularly when the nutrition on offer exceeds the animal\u2019s capacity for bone and muscle growth.\nResearch in the 1970s demonstrated that in the early phases of an animal\u2019s growth, when feeding high quality rations, around 50-60 percent of the net energy intake is used for bone and muscle growth, with the remainder being deposited as fat.\nIn the later stages of growth, this use of energy changes dramatically with 85-90pc of the energy intake being deposited as fatness.\nFatness is also impacted by genetics. There have been numerous research projects which have established the level of heritability of fatness, with most published results indicating fatness is moderately heritable at around 30pc. This means that selection of sires can strongly impact the levels of fatness in the next generation.\nThe challenge with fatness is that it isn\u2019t as straightforward as selecting for the trait and then managing the environment (largely through nutrition) to achieve the desired level of fatness.\nMultiple factors, including genetics and variations in nutrition result in fat deposition varying significantly among animals.\nResearch published by Professor Wayne Pitchford from the University of Adelaide demonstrated that about three quarters of the genetic variation in adult body condition score (BCS) is independent of the genetic variation observed in the measurement of younger animals.\nIn practical terms producers need to firstly consider what role fatness plays in their herds.\nMany producers aim to maintain a level of fatness in order to ensure their females meet a benchmark for joining and calving, as well as to meet expectations for market specifications in sale animals. These considerations often are forefront of a selection process.\nThis can be confused further when producers start to assess bulls in sale offerings and attempt to make an assumption of a bull\u2019s physical appearance and level of fatness and his influence on their herd.\nAn earlier genetics article on Beef Central highlighted the difference between the physical appearance of a bull and his actual genetic potential. In traits such as fatness, the measurements of the bull provided in the supplementary sheets are more a result of the environment than genetics.\nA fat bull at sale day does not means his progeny will be fat or fatter than the current generation at home.\nThe level of body condition bulls display is more appropriately considered in regard to his actual ability to commence work as a fertile and free moving bull.\nThe QDPI publication \u201cBull Selection \u2013 Buying Better Bulls\u201d notes that \u201cOver fat bulls do no work as well as bulls in forward store or working order. Obese bulls tend to have lower libido or desire to serve cows, arthritic conditions, and deteriorating semen quality.\u201d\nSemen quality impact\nSemen quality is a significant issue in bulls with higher levels of fatness. Several key research projects have published data that demonstrates bulls which have been fed high energy diets from weaning to 15 months of age had greater levels of fatness deposited in their scrotums and had lower levels of daily sperm production than bulls which were grown on medium energy diets.\nThis reflects work published in Canada which showed bulls with 4mm of fat cover produced 60pc more sperm, and at higher semen quality than was produced by bulls with 10mm of fatness.\nWith this in mind, producers making selection decisions on bulls should firstly take note of the fatness scans on bulls in catalogues, and consider if the bulls that they have an interest in, are capable of achieving the mating goals that are in place within a program.\nIt may be that the fatter bull\u2019s potential poses a greater risk of failing to meet conception targets in their first year of use compared to a bull with lower fat scans.\nIn regard to the ability of the bull to shape the future levels of fatness within a herd, the raw scans are less helpful. If producers are clear on the levels of fatness they need in their herd for breeding or marketing outcomes, the genetic information provided by the bull\u2019s EBVs are more useful. This information reflects the genetic impact a bull can have.\nFinally producers need to consider how the genetics of their cow herd, combined with the environmental conditions of their program are likely to impact future performance.\nIt is worth remembering that selecting a bull with above average fatness will result in a move towards increased fatness in his progeny, regardless of his own condition on sale day. Similarly selecting for below average can help reduce the levels of fatness his progeny should display.\nAlastair Rayner is the Principal of RaynerAg, an agricultural advisory service based in NSW.

{"text":"Ayurveda identifies three types of energy. These energies are closely related to the basic biology and functioning of the body. Each type performs a different function and is responsible in different ways for the body\u2019s functions. Energy is required to make movement, metabolize nutrients in cells, and lubricate and maintain a cell\u2019s structure. These three types of energy are called kapha. Should you have any questions regarding where by and also how to utilize ayurherbs ayurveda clinic, you possibly can email us from our own page.\nAyurveda recognizes that each person has a unique combination or doshas. This natural balance is what gives rise to our unique mental and physical characteristics. By identifying and maintaining our Prakruti (balanced doshas), we can achieve optimal health and well-being. Vata, a common mental dosha, affects our thinking, behavior, and information processing. This dosha also influences our body fluids and nerve impulses.\nAlthough everyone can have all three doshas (or none at all), most people are more likely to have one or two dominant. A certified Ayurvedic physician can help you determine your dosha type.\nPrakruti, also known as the constitution of an individual, is a key factor in Ayurveda\u2019s determination of the appropriate therapeutic program. Prakruti is a comprehensive concept that considers an individual\u2019s lifestyle, diet, click here. and susceptibility to different diseases. It aims to treat the patient as a whole and address the underlying cause. Two main doshas are Pitta and Vata. The type of treatment required will depend on the constitution of each individual.\nPrakruti plays a vital role in maintaining the correct balance of the body\u2019s three doshas. Vata is responsible for the body\u2019s physiology. It is composed of elements like air and fire. Pitta controls the mind, emotions and is similar to Vata dosha. If you bring the opposites together, you can create a healthy balance.\nIn Ayurveda, pancha karma is a holistic healing technique. It relies on five elements to dissolve toxins in the body. It is the base for many other Ayurvedic therapies. This treatment focuses primarily on cleansing the body via specific dietary changes and lifestyle modifications.\nPancha karma consists of a series of treatments that can treat a variety of diseases. The most important procedure, known simply as vasti targets the digestive tract. This treatment uses medicated oil to inject the colon through the anus. The medicated oil can be administered in increasing dosages to liquefy fat-soluble poisons.\nAyurveda treatment is holistic. They include diet, click here. meditation, and massage techniques that use various herbs and oils. Ayurvedic practitioners employ specific techniques to meet the needs of each individual, as each body is unique. They also identify the three fundamental energies that make up the body, the doshas Vata Pitta Kapha.

{"text":"It\u2019s time for the annual speculation\u2026 Will a mysterious marmot pop out of his underground bunker and be scared by the sight of his own body obscuring the radiant beams of the sun, thus ensuring that the winter solstice continues for another forty days?\nEven though there are a few places less concerned with an additional 6 weeks of winter, we all know the story \u2013 Will the groundhog see its shadow?\nScientists will tell you, whether Punxsutawney Phil sees his shadow or not, Winter officially ends on March 19th. Folklorists can explain that what we call Groundhog Day was once Winter Candelmas, or the pagan marking of mid-winter, similar to May Day or Halloween. American historians note that the first Groundhog Day celebration was held on Feb. 2, 1877, at Gobbler's Knob in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania. Yes, just like in the Bill Murray movie.\nThe truth gets a little more complicated \u2013 as it often does.\nThe European countries we now know as England, France, Germany, Austria, Spain and the Czech Republic were once largely inhabited by the Celtic peoples. They were considered more wild and earthy than the early \u2018classical\u2019 civilizations of the Greeks and Romans. Or perhaps they were people from these cultures who preferred the more rugged life they\u2019d seen from the Norse invaders.\nRegardless, they had a significant effect on culture in Europe and eventually in America. They were, early on, more concerned with gauging and predicting the weather, likely as a way to take control of their agriculturally-based existence.\nMany of the monuments like Stonehenge and the Callanish stones were, we believe, designed to help predict the weather, if not just mark the days and times for these ancient peoples. And it was the Celts who gave us the four seasons, originally called Beltane (1 May), Samhain (1 November), Imbolc (1 February), and Lugnasadh (1 August). They may or may not have coincided with worship of a particular solar or lunar deity.\nOf course, when Christianity spread to Rome and many other parts of the world, those celebrations would be largely refocused to the one true God, Jehovah and his son Jesus.\nFor the February time of Imbolc, farmers would pray for mild weather to plant their crops. Fishermen would spend time repairing and refreshing their nets and boats, and many would use divination to determine the weather.\nOne of the stranger practices of seeking the mind of the divine grew up in the Germanic portion of the Celts, eventually making its way to the \u2018New World\u2019 with their descendants, the Pennsylvania Dutch. As early as 1523, the people would look to a more earthy prophet \u2013 a Dachs, or Badger.\nNot finding a lot of badgers in Pennsylvania at the time, the settlers turned to a related rodent, the groundhog.\nOur modern celebrations came about as the result of a newspaper publisher, groundhog hunter and Elks lodge member - Clymer Freas. He took the weird pseudo-worship of the woodchuck practiced by some of his more traditional Germanic neighbors and turned it into a commercialized, tourist-drawing spectacle.\nAnd lest you think we are uniquely strange, Orthodox Christians in Serbia and Croatia keep their eyes peeled for the first two weeks of February to see if bears come out of hibernation. If the Ursus rise, but are confused by their shadows, they\u2019ll go back to sleep for another 6 weeks.\nOf course, we no longer need to rely on standing stones, confused mammals or caustic gods to determine what our weather \u2013 and planting season - will be like. Although given some weather forecaster\u2019s track records, maybe we\u2019d be better off if we did.\nRegardless, we rely mostly on science and past recorded history to determine whether we should grab a sweater, umbrella or suntan lotion on our way out the door. Like most of the country, we will see a temporary dip in temperatures the first few days of February, but the local news assures us, we\u2019ll be back to warm enough soon.\nThe few days of cooler, wetter weather won\u2019t be that drastic of a change, but we do know some things are on our horizon. For example, the first lovebug swarm of 2024 will be here soon. Some of our longer-term snowbirds will be migrating back to the Midwest. And bat maternity season is on the horizon.\nAnd, of course, we\u2019ve got bugs. It seems like we almost never get away from them \u2013 but we shouldn\u2019t tolerate them in our homes. If you haven\u2019t already, check out our Go Green Perimeter Plus. It eliminates and protects against all manner of creepy crawlies here on the Gulf Coast of Florida.

{"text":"Do you wonder about the net height in tennis when playing doubles? There are several court differences when playing singles and doubles tennis, which might make you wonder if there is a difference in the net\u2019s height too.\nA tennis net is 3 feet high in the center of the court and 3 feet 6 inches high at the sides. Two poles hold the net in place. The net is slightly lower in the middle of the court than at the sides because of its weight. The net\u2019s height when playing singles and doubles tennis is the same.\nAlthough the net\u2019s height is the same when playing singles tennis or doubles tennis, there are several court differences. We\u2019ll discuss the differences between the net and court when playing doubles and singles tennis to give you a better idea of how these two differ.\nHow High Is The Tennis Net When Playing Doubles?\nThe net height is critical when playing tennis, as it can ruin your game if the net isn\u2019t set to the proper height. When playing doubles, the tennis net must be set to 3 feet and 6 inches at the sides. The net is held in place by a pole on each side that supports it. The net will then be exactly 3 feet high in the middle of the court.\nThis change in height from the sides to the middle is because of the net\u2019s weight, making it hang slightly lower in the middle. The net must also be 3 feet away from the doubles sidelines when playing doubles, so the posts don\u2019t get in the way of the player\u2019s vision.\nConsidering that these are the dimensions when playing doubles tennis, you may wonder if the net is different and set to a different height when playing singles.\nIs The Net Different When Playing Singles And Doubles Tennis?\nDespite the court size and game structure differences when playing doubles and singles tennis, the net is set to the same height for both games. The net is also 3 feet 6 inches high at the sides and 3 feet high in the middle when playing singles tennis.\nYou don\u2019t have to adjust your hitting angles when playing singles or doubles tennis. As mentioned, it is of utmost importance that the net is set to this exact height. Otherwise, you may find yourself hitting into the net for the entire match, especially when playing lower shots.\nAlthough the net height is the same when playing singles and doubles tennis, there are several differences between these two types of tennis on the court. You may wonder how the court differs when playing singles or doubles tennis, so let\u2019s consider these differences in more detail.\nSingles VS Doubles In Tennis: How Does The Court Differ?\nThere are several strategic differences when playing singles and doubles tennis. If you don\u2019t know the difference between these two, singles tennis has two players on the court, one on each side. Doubles tennis has four players on the court, two (of the same team) on each side.\nOf course, this means that there is less space on the court for each player, making the court smaller. But there are also several court differences when playing singles and doubles tennis to accommodate the additional players. The primary differences in the court when playing singles and doubles tennis are:\n- The width of the court\n- The width of the net\n- The playing area\nUnderstanding these court differences will help you grasp some of the differences between singles and doubles tennis, helping you to adjust your playing strategy accordingly. So, let\u2019s discuss these differences in more detail.\nWidth Of The Court\nThe length of the court when playing singles and doubles tennis is the same at 78 feet. However, there is a difference in the width of the court. When playing singles tennis, the total width of the court is 27 feet. You aren\u2019t allowed to hit the ball into the outer white section, as this is considered out.\nWhen playing doubles, the width of the court is 36 feet, and you consider the outer white lines as the sidelines. Hitting over these lines will be considered out, but you can hit the ball into the outer white section, which accounts for the wider court size when playing doubles.\nThe wider court affects the total playing area of doubles tennis, which we will discuss later. However, the wider court also affects the net. How does the court width affect the net, you may ask?\nWidth Of The Net\nSeeing as the court is wider when playing doubles tennis, the net must also be wider to accommodate the change. When playing singles tennis, the net must be 33 feet wide to cover the court\u2019s width and ensure a 3-foot overlap on each side.\nWhen playing doubles, the width of the net should be 42 feet to ensure that the entire width of the court is covered and there is still a 3-foot overlap on each side. Most clubs permanently have doubles nets on their courts since you can play singles tennis with a doubles net, but you can\u2019t play doubles tennis with a singles net.\nCertain courts, like Wimbledon or other prestigious courts, may change the nets for singles or doubles tournaments. Still, it depends on whether it is only a singles tournament or if there will be a mix of singles and doubles matches.\nFinally, since the court is wider when playing doubles tennis, the total playing area is also more. When playing singles tennis, the total playing area of the court is 2106 square feet. This means that both players have an area of 1053 square feet to cover.\nWhen playing doubles, the total court surface area is 2808 square feet, meaning that each player has an area of 702 square feet to cover, and each team has an area of 1404 square feet to cover. Despite the differences in the court width, net width, and playing area, single players still have a much larger court to cover than each doubles player.\nThis is why many consider singles tennis a more challenging form of tennis since you must read your opponent better and have more ground to cover. Regardless, many people enjoy doubles tennis as there is more of a social aspect to this style of tennis.\nThe net height for doubles tennis is the same as for singles tennis, 3 feet and 6 inches on the sides and 3 feet in the center. The net is slightly lower in the center because of its weight. The tennis net for doubles is longer than for singles, as the court is wider.","metadata":{"date":1709128318000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947474715.58\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240228112121-20240228142121-00798.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.956787169,"token_count":1317,"url":"https:\/\/theracketlife.com\/tennis-net-height-for-doubles\/"},"score":4,"id":"233"}
{"text":"Stress fractures refer to tiny cracks in bone that typically develop as a result of excessive repetitive activity. They most commonly occur in the lower extremities (legs and feet) but it is also possible for them to occur in the upper extremities (arms and hands). Over time, repetitive activities can impact the bone by altering the ways in which it breaks down and reforms. If you are feeling pain or discomfort from stress fractures, contact Paul Wiener Physical Therapy today to schedule a consultation with a Hackensack, NJ physical therapist.\nHow do stress fractures occur?\nBefore you can work on preventing stress fractures, it is important to understand what types of activities are higher risks. Athletes in particular are at a higher risk of developing stress fractures, due to the amount of stress that is put on their lower extremities through running, jumping, leaping, dancing, tumbling, or excessive moving in general. Some occupations may be higher risk factors for the development of stress fractures as well, such as those that require prolonged periods of time walking from place to place or spending time on one\u2019s feet. This is especially true if the workday is spent walking or standing on hard surfaces, such as concrete.\nHow can I find relief for stress fractures?\nStress fractures can be successfully treated through physical therapy. Our physical therapists will conduct an initial evaluation that will include a physical exam, a review of health history, and an analysis of symptoms. If needed, additional diagnostic tests (such as an MRI scan) may be conducted.

{"text":"The purple passion plant, or Gynura aurantiaca to give its botanical name, is an unusual and very attractive plant that has gained popularity because of its unique foliage. When young, the plant has soft, downy leaves with an almost velvety texture. Thick, deep purple hairs sprout from the green leaves, bringing a splash of bright color to your home. Its cascading growth habit makes it an attractive addition to an indoor hanging basket. Although most species take several years to reach their full glory, the short-lived purple passion flower is most dazzling in its youth. The plant\u2019s brightest colors usually occur in the first two to three years of its life. After that, it becomes a little more discreet. In southern regions, the purple passion plant grows wild. In the rest of the world, it is preferably used as a houseplant. With proper care, the purple passion plant can live for 5 to 7 years. If you want to enjoy the amazing natural beauty of this unique plant, here\u2019s what you need to know about growing and caring for the purple passion plant.\nCareful with water\nLike most plants, passionflower violets need the right amount of water to grow. Too much water is as bad as too little, so water as much as you need. The plant\u2019s soil should be evenly moist, but you should not leave the plant in water. If the plant is wet, there is a chance of root rot. When you water the plant, do not use a watering can, as it can wet the leaves \u2013 instead, pour the water directly into the soil. As recommended by gardenguides.com, allow the soil to dry out a bit between waterings. As a guideline, water houseplants once a week from April to September. Water less often in winter: use the moisture in the soil as a safety net.\nPurple passion flowers are exceptionally heat tolerant and thrive best in climates where the average temperature during the day is 65-75 degrees Fahrenheit and does not drop below 55 degrees at night. If you are looking for an ideal location for a purple houseplant, look for one where the sunlight is very strong or filtered. The more light, the more flowers. Insufficient light can cause the leaves to remain green instead of their characteristic purple hue. The stems may also become long and elongated. To avoid burning the leaves, the plant should be kept away from the hot afternoon sun. An east-facing window is ideal. If you decide to grow the plant outside, find a location for the plant that is as close as possible to the optimal temperature range of 65 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit. Although a plant grown outdoors will not survive the winter, it may come back to life in the spring with a few propagated shoots that have overwintered indoors. If the plant\u2019s leaves begin to curl or turn brown, it is a sign that the plant is getting too much direct sunlight. Cut off the affected leaves and move the plant away from direct sunlight.\n- pH control \u2013 Passionflower plants should be grown in well-drained, fertile, sandy loam soil. The ideal pH range is 6.5 to 7.5. Check the pH of the soil and bring it into the optimum range if necessary.\n- Don\u2019t forget to fertilize \u2013 Purple passion plants are fairly easy to care for, but they do need some TLC from time to time. To keep the plant healthy, fertilize it every two weeks with a half-diluted commercial fertilizer for houseplants. Since growth slows down in winter, you can reduce the fertilization schedule to once a month.\n- Prune regularly \u2013 Prune away excess growth regularly to prevent the plants from becoming immature. This not only creates a more beautiful shape, but also encourages the plant to produce new, colorful leaves.\n- Cut the flowers \u2013 Once your plant is fully grown, it will begin to bloom. The small orange flowers it produces are attractive, but can emit a rather unpleasant odor. For this reason, most people prefer to cut the flowers off as soon as they mature. Since flowering is a sign that your plant is nearing the end of its life, it is also the ideal time to start harvesting cuttings for propagation.\n- Beware of insects \u2013 Purple passionflower plants are a magnet for spider mites and small insects. Although spider mites are difficult to see with the naked eye, brown spots or bronze-colored leaves should be considered a warning sign. To treat spider mites, pull out the affected leaves and wash the plant thoroughly with a water hose.\nDistribution of wetlands\nPurple passion flowers can be very beautiful when young, but they have a very short life span. Once they are fully grown and begin to bloom, it is time to propagate them. As mydomaine.com notes, although the plants can be rooted in water, it is better to propagate them in soil because they tend to rot. Pruning should be done in the summer or spring. First, put seed starting mix in a small pot. Make a small hole in the center of the soil and water lightly. Next, cut a three-inch piece from the stem of the plant. Make sure the stem is healthy and has leaves. Cut off all the leaves at the bottom of the cut, leaving the top four leaves. Plant the cuttings in the hole you dug in the ground and stabilize them by pressing them lightly into the surrounding soil. Water the soil lightly. Place a clear plastic bag over the cuttings to create a moist environment. Make sure the plastic does not directly touch the leaves. Although cuttings need less sunlight than a mature plant, they need plenty of indirect light \u2013 an east-facing window is ideal. Keep the soil moist, but avoid overwatering. Remove the plastic bag at regular intervals to allow the leaves to dry. When you notice signs of growth, it means the pruning is complete and you can now start caring for the plant as usual. According to gardenerdy.com (gardenerdy.com \/how to care for a passionflower\/), it usually takes about 3 weeks for the stems to take root.\nFrequently asked questions\nHow often do you water the purple passion plant?\n5 SIMPLE STEPS FOR A HEALTHY PASSIONAL PLANT Be sure not to overwater this plant, give enough water to saturate the roots without causing root rot. Water about once a week, depending on sun exposure. Provide adequate moisture by spraying or using a humidifier!\nWhy is my purple passion plant dying?\nOver or under watering your passionflower plant can be harmful and cause the plant to wilt. The soil should be evenly moist, but not wet. If you have overwatered your plant and it appears to be wilting, do not water it until the soil is dry to a depth of 2.5 inches. \u2026.This can help the plant recover and get back on its feet.\nHow do you prune the purple passion plant?\nLiterally pinch the small leaves at the end of the stem between your finger and thumb. The plant will replace each end of the stem with a new pair of stems and the propagation of new branches will keep the plant bushy. Purple passionflower plants are happy under normal conditions. They like the soil in the pot to stay moist.\nFeedback,purple passion plant for sale,purple passion plant droopy,purple passion plant home depot,purple passion plant cats,gynura,purple passion fruit,purple passion plant benefits,purple passion propagation,purple passion plant seeds,how to propagate purple plant,water rooting plants,velvet plant description,velvet plant size,velvet plant seeds,velvet plant temperatures,purple velvet plant for sale,velvet calathea plant,gynura aurantiaca seeds,plant with soft velvety leaves,fuzzy green leaves with purple underneath,purple velvet plant light requirements,purple velvet plant toxic to cats,plant with hairy purple leaves,white spots on purple passion plant,purple iridescent plant,house plant with fuzzy leaves,Privacy settings,How Search works,Gynura aurantiaca,Dracaena trifasciata,Painted\u2011leaf begonia,Calatheas,Chinese evergreens,Garden croton,See more,Dumb canes,Spider plant,Jade plant,Common ivy,Radiator plants,Peace lily,purple passion plant propagation,purple velvet plant care,purple passion plant flower smell","metadata":{"date":1708536469000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947473524.88\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240221170215-20240221200215-00899.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9304366112,"token_count":1768,"url":"https:\/\/decoratoradvice.com\/how-to-grow-and-take-care-of-a-purple-passion-plant\/"},"score":3,"id":"235"}

{"text":"It\u2019s not just the bags under your eyes or the zits on your face giving away how stressed you are. Your mouth can, too. But not in the way of words (or rants, rather). But in the form of problems on your teeth and gums.\nHere are the ways stress wreaks havoc on oral health.\nYou grind your teeth\nAnxiety is notorious for triggering bruxism, the medical term for teeth grinding. Some believe that it\u2019s a coping mechanism. When people under intense pressure can\u2019t find an outlet to diffuse their stress, they resort to clenching their teeth, usually without them knowing it.\nIt alleviates some of the negative feelings, but when it becomes a habit, it can damage the teeth. It specifically wears down the enamel, the protective layer of the tooth. When that happens, you may be more prone to sensitivity.\nIt\u2019s important to stop bruxism before it causes more serious problems. The only problem here is most people are unaware that they indeed grind their teeth precisely because it often occurs during sleep. If you experience headaches in the morning or pains in the jaw quite frequently, that should make you suspicious about your nighttime habit. Visit your dentist and ask for a custom mouth guard.\nYou get tooth decays\nWhen you\u2019re swamped with too much work or family drama, proper hygiene is one of the things that take a backseat. You probably retire to bed as soon as you get home, without care about brushing your teeth. Or, you may be spending your midnights binge-eating on sugary food for comfort.\nAll these can put you at risk for tooth decays. And if you\u2019ve been delaying removal of your wisdom teeth at a West Valley, Utah clinic, you\u2019re more vulnerable to such problems. There\u2019s no other way around proper, regular hygiene. No shortcuts. No excuses. You really have to commit to its discipline.\nNow, if stress is what\u2019s keeping you from being on track, then you have to address this. Two things you can do: avoid it or face it head on smartly. For instance, if too much work is what\u2019s stressing you out, you can \u201cavoid\u201d it by delegating some tasks to your colleagues. Or, you can \u201cface it head on smartly\u201d by using technologies, for example, to make work easier. With stress addressed, you\u2019ll hopefully have the energy and the time to take care of your oral health.\nYour gums bleed\nStress makes it harder for the body to produce immune cells that would fight bacteria. This, coupled with the fact that you\u2019re more likely to skip proper hygiene, will allow microorganisms to grow and cause inflammation. Later, you may find yourself suffering from gum infections and diseases.\nYou may notice bleeding gums when brushing teeth. Or, you feel like your teeth are shifting or getting loose. Don\u2019t dismiss this, as these are the early signs of gingivitis. Consult your dentist for medications. Talk to a therapist as well for effective stress-relieving techniques.\nHow are you coping with stress? Your mouth perhaps can \u201cspeak\u201d for you. If you experience these things mentioned above, you have a lot more to do in the stress management department.","metadata":{"date":1709255470000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947474893.90\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240229234355-20240301024355-00897.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.941611588,"token_count":699,"url":"https:\/\/childrenfirstamerica.org\/are-you-stressed-your-mouth-can-tell-literally\/"},"score":3,"id":"238"}

{"text":"LOS ANGELES (CNS)\u2014With regional intensive care unit (ICU) capacity still officially considered to be zero, Gov. Gavin Newsom said Dec. 21 that the regional stay-at-home order imposed by the state for the entirety of Southern California will almost assuredly be extended beyond next week\u2019s expiration date.\n\u201cWe are likely, I think it\u2019s pretty self-evident, going to need to extend those regional dates,\u201d Newsom said.\n\u201cBased upon all the data and based upon all these trend lines, it is very likely based on those current trends that we'll need to extend that stay-at-home order, [which] you recall was a three-week order when we announced it.\u201d\nThe regional stay-at-home order for the 11-county Southern California region took effect at 11:59 p.m. Dec. 6, and was originally set to end on Dec. 28. Newsom didn\u2019t give an indication of exactly when a decision on extending the order would be made, or how much long the order would remain in place.\nThe Southern California region covers Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Diego, Imperial, Inyo, Mono, San Bernardino, San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara, and Ventura counties.

{"text":"This month, another study was released showing that the number of couples filing for the divorce after the age of 50 continues to grow, even while the divorce rate in the United States is dropping in all other age groups. It seems that as younger couples are avoiding divorce, more older couples are ending their marriages after decades of being together.\nWhat is causing this new trend of \u201cgrey divorce?\u201d\n- More women have careers and financial stability. In past generations, many women were forced to stay in unhappy marriages because they simply didn\u2019t have the means or ability to leave and be out on their own. These days, a much large percentage of women have their own careers and their own money, making it more plausible to support themselves and their children without their husband\u2019s help.\n- People are living longer and healthier lives. The average lifespan is growing, and more and more Americans are still healthy and active in their 60s, 70s, and 80s. At the same time, fewer people are widowed young. The result is that couples are living together for 40 and 50 years\u2014and many know that even if they divorce, they could have decades of healthy years left to restart their lives and find happiness.\n- Older couples don\u2019t have to consider children\u2019s needs. Many couples are holding off on divorce until their children leave the nest and establish their own lives\u2014and in a large number of cases, this doesn\u2019t occur until parents are in their 50s.\n- There is less of a stigma surrounding divorce. Even a generation ago, divorce was seen as a dark and shameful decision\u2014one that shouldn\u2019t even be discussed. Today, many more people understand that divorce is sometimes necessary and sometimes best for everyone involved, including children.\n- Fewer couples are staying married for religious reasons. It wasn\u2019t so long ago that getting a divorce could affect your standing at your church\u2014and with your god. Now, divorce isn\u2019t just more accepted by society at large, it is also more accepted in places of worship.\nStarting the divorce process after many years of marriage is difficult for a number of reasons and can be more complex, due to a couple\u2019s amount of property and assets.

The vintage was marked by unpredictable weather conditions which although didn\u2019t have a big impact on a general level, nonetheless led to uncertainty in the vineyard and the occasional threat of mildew. The unpredictable weather conditions meant diligence was needed in the vineyard to maintain the health of the grapes and highlights the importance of continued hard work in the winery to keep quality levels high.\nThe official recognition of the vintage as \u2018Good\u2019 is the result of a rigorous and fully transparent quality assurance process which involved analysing and tasting all wines destined to be released on the market.\nThe quality control process starts in the fermentation tanks from where the Board technicians collected more than 5,245 samples that were subsequently tasted by 150 professionals.\nIn total, 332.64 million litres of the 2018 harvest have obtained the right to be certificated as wines protected by the DOCa Rioja (28.94 white, 16.37 pink and 287.33 red).\nThe objective of the quality control process is to \u2018certify the quality of all the wines to ensure they are an indisputable and honest reflection of the character of the vintage\u2019 cites Pablo Franco, director of the Control body of the Consejo Regulador DOCa Rioja. The quality requirements for a wine to be labelled under the Rioja DOCa classification have become stricter in recent years, with the aim of ensuring that Rioja continues to be reference point for quality wines.\nAmong the characteristics that define the average profile of the wines from the 2018 harvest, whose average alcohol level is slightly lower than in previous years, of particular note is the refined quality of the reds which possess intense and vivid colours, as well as a harmonious palate. The Plenary Committee of the Regulatory Body was also keen to underline the great quality of the white wines of the vintage, in particular the character and personality of the indigenous varieties of Rioja which have produced wines with great aromatic intensity and an excellent structure in the mouth.","metadata":{"date":1709322307000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947475701.61\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240301193300-20240301223300-00499.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9373574853,"token_count":558,"url":"https:\/\/riojawine.com\/en\/news\/2018-the-good-one\/"},"score":1,"id":"244"}

{"text":"From CBS Sportsline-\nHAVRE DE GRACE, Md. \u2014 Burned out, injured and all but forgotten for two years, Se Ri Pak returned to the spotlight in stunning fashion Sunday when her utility club from 201 yards stopped 3 inches from the hole for a sudden-death playoff victory over Karrie Webb in the LPGA Championship.\nPak atoned for a three-putt bogey on the 18th hole in regulation that kept her from winning, delivering a spectacular finish to a tournament that was up for grabs over the final two hours at Bulle Rock.\n\u201cI\u2019m very happy to be back again,\u201d Pak said. \u201cI\u2019m a very lucky person. I\u2019m as happy a person has ever been.\u201d\nIt all must have looked familiar to Webb, who was trying to capture the second leg of the Grand Slam.\nJust two months ago, Webb holed a pitching wedge from 116 yards on the 18th hole at the Kraft Nabisco Championship for an eagle that placed her in a playoff, and her victory was a sign that the Hall of Famer\u2019s game had returned.\n\u201cI thought I was getting my own medicine,\u201d Webb said after watching Pak\u2019s remarkable shot from about 200 yards.\nSe Ri Pak wins her third LPGA Championship and fifth major. (AP)\nWebb also had gone through some struggles while retooling her swing, and after winning the Kraft Nabisco, Pak saw her a few weeks later and gave her a big hug.\n\u201cShe told me, \u2018Now it\u2019s my turn. I\u2019ll win the next one,\u2019\u201d Webb recalled.\nMichelle Wie was among six players who had a chance to either win or get into a playoff on the final hole, but the 16-year-old from Hawaii wasted too many chances.\nPak\u2019s last victory was two years ago at the Michelob Ultra Open, which gave her enough points for the World Golf Hall of Fame. Then, the 28-year-old South Korean and her electric smile all but vanished from the LPGA Tour, and she sat out the last three months of the 2005 season to get healthy and get happy.\nShe acknowledged being burned out, and considered her injury a gift because it forced her to stop playing. She was never more happy on the golf course Sunday, especially after watching her utility club \u2014 the equivalent of a 4-iron \u2014 headed for the hole.\nIt looked like it might go in, much like Shaun Micheel\u2019s 7-iron at Oak Hill when he won the 2003 PGA Championship. This one stopped a few turns short, all but clinching victory. Pak raised both arms in victory, then delivered a massive uppercut to signal her return, and jumped into the arms of her caddie.\n\u201cFirst time I jumped on the golf course,\u201d Pak said.\nWebb, who missed birdie putts of 4 and 10 feet on the last two holes in regulation, hit her approach in the playoff to about 20 feet, but the putt to force another hole veered well to the left.\nPak won her fifth major, and joined Mickey Wright, Kathy Whitworth, Patty Sheehan and Annika Sorenstam as the only three-time winners of the LPGA Championship.\nWie\u2019s third birdie in a five-hole stretch brought her within one of the lead, but she missed the 16th green with a wedge and watched her 4-foot par putt spin 270 degrees out of the cup. She narrowly missed an 8-foot birdie on the 171-yard 17th, then had to make a 50-foot birdie on the 18th to join the playoff. It looked good until the final few feet, then ran 8 feet by and she wound up three-putting for bogey and a 72 to tie for fifth.\n\u201cI feel like I\u2019m getting closer and closer,\u201d she said. \u201cIt shows a lot that I played my \u2018B\u2019 game and I\u2019m still in the top five.\u201d\nPak became the seventh South Korean in 14 events to win on the LPGA Tour, and it was fitting that hers came in a major. Pak was responsible for so many joining her in the United States, with 32 players from South Korea now on the LPGA Tour.\nAnd she needed a few breaks.\nShe holed a 50-foot birdie putt on the par-3 12th hole to stay in the game, and she surged into the lead with a chip-and-putt birdie on the par-5 15th and a wedge from the rough to within 4 feet for birdie on the 16th.\nBetter yet, she put the three-putt bogey on the 18th hole in regulation out of her mind.\nPak laid back off the tee on the 385-yard closing hole in the playoff, leaving her a long shot with her utility club. But it never left its line, and all Webb could do was smile.\nSe Ri\u2019s victory today had to make golf fans smile and her many fans cry. She was as low as can be at this tournament one year ago. Golf was no longer any fun for her Se Ri admitted to the press.\nTo win the LPGA one year later. See Se Ri smile back and that jump she made at 18. It was a fantastic finish to a tournament that was a great battle all day Sunday.\nI think its safe to say we\u2019ve seen the return of Se Ri Pak.\n- Breakthrough- Ai Miyazato wins the Evian Masters\n- Morgan Pressel\u2019s 2nd round 65 low score for the ADT\n- Honesty wins\n- M.J.

{"text":"I'm a 4th year physics major from India. My degree is a dual one - 5 years and both Bachelor's and Master's. I want to take up theoretical physics in the future and pursue a PhD after I graduate - around 1.5 years from now.\nI am a decent student with a somewhat decent CGPA. My undergrad research experience was mostly carried out at my home institution and a couple other places I visited during the summer - both in India. I presented some of our work at an international conference this year (albeit online since it was a question of funds that I didn't have) and another of my work is currently on the arXiv while me and my supervisor look for journals. My summer experiences were more passive - one was a basic reading project and the other involved some work but nothing too novel.\nI am inclined to look for a PhD outside of India and convincing potential advisors is a big thing, of course, along with compatibility with said advisor. I was wondering if I should email potential advisors in places abroad to ask for a summer opportunity. The way it seems to me, it would be a good way to convince them and it would give me a good idea of how compatible I am with them. Even if I do not finally pursue a PhD with them, it nevertheless counts for a good experience and is good networking. Of course, I'm going to apply to the international summer programmes as well but they tend to be very selective and there can be a clash of timings.\nThis is especially important because I'll complete my Master's as well when I graduate - as far as I know, places in the US or Canada do not actually have a direct PhD program and one needs to spend the first 2 years taking courses. I was looking at pure research institutes like Perimeter - it doesn't actually mention a lot about its PhD program except that you've to convince a professor and manage to get into one of the affiliated institutes and qualify for their personal criteria for a PhD as well but I've seen it being mentioned that Perimeter prefers students if they've gone through their 1 year Master's program. In case that is true, having a summer experience with one of the professors may also help since I don't think I'm going to apply for another Master's program, especially since I'll need to undertake two years of courses again if I get into a PhD there. In Europe, I'd guess such an experience would definitely give me an edge since they have mostly direct PhD programs but if I'm not wrong, they don't have a lot of vacancies or funds to support summer students - so unless I do secure funding from international programs, it'll be for naught.\nThe cons to this are that I don't know if mailing people like this is even common or looked upon favorably. Then there is the question of funds. I'm also not sure what to say to a professor with whom I manage to spend the summer but decide not to do my PhD. Finally, I'm aware that getting a reply, and a positive one at that, from such mails is very difficult - I've mailed a lot of professors (even at my home institution) over the last 3 years and haven't really gotten a lot of affirmative replies.\nSo, I would like to ask if this is a feasible option to look at or not and any advice for the same.","metadata":{"date":1709375726000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947475806.52\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240302084508-20240302114508-00897.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9846391678,"token_count":687,"url":"https:\/\/academia.stackexchange.com\/questions\/201682\/summer-opportunities-before-applying-for-a-phd"},"score":1,"id":"253"}

In this paper, I will discuss the composition of and procedures within this Electoral College system in detail. The Electoral College is composed of a total of 538 Electors, of which 270 votes are needed as a majority to elect the President.

{"text":"The rapid spread of and severity of Covid-19, scientists and researchers have been aggressive in developing cheap and effective vaccine to combat the virus.\nIn the year gone by, companies across the globe have developed over 200 vaccines and 40 more are underway for consideration. The question however arises, is how the vaccine works, the know-how of our immune system and treatment of the infected conditions. The types of vaccination may be categorized on the basis of: 1. Using a whole germ 2. Using parts of the germ that triggers the immune system 3. Using the genetic material\/part that provides the instructions for making specific proteins.\nWhile most vaccines stimulate the body to make antibodies, some antibody-based tests for coronavirus infection may return a positive result even if you are not, or were not previously infected with the coronavirus. This is called vaccine-induced seropositivity (VISP) test result.\nAntibody tests and their functions\nIn order to establish vaccine efficacy and vaccine-induced immune response, measuring these antibody levels in whole blood, plasma or serum could play a vital role. There are three types of antibodies created in response to infection: IgA, IgG and IgM. IgG is used in most antibody tests as it persists for the longest time and may reflect longer\u2010term immunity, although it is the last to rise after infection. Many tests assess both IgG and IgM. IgM typically rises quickly with infection and declines soon after an infection is cleared.\nBenefits of Antibody testing\nThere are several advantages of antibody testing against antigen testing. Antibodies test can inform vaccination utilization and status of vaccine response at multiple levels, a) data to establish a threshold for protection or immunity, b) post-vaccination initial response, c) duration of vaccination response. The test that detected IgG is useful to detect herd immunity and previous or recurring infections.\nThis test detects IgG antibodies that develop in most patients within seven to 10 days after symptoms of COVID-19 begin. Since IgG antibodies remain in the blood after an infection has passed, they can be the key indicators of COVID-19 in the recent past, that can act as a protection against future infection.\nIt is therefore important to understand that tests to detect antibody responses to COVID-19 in the population will support the development of vaccines.

Care products containing caffeine, such as creams and serums, can combat these signs of aging. Caffeine's active ingredients stimulate blood circulation and firm the skin, reducing the appearance of wrinkles.\nThe importance of product choice\nWith so many products available on the market, it's essential to make an informed choice when making your purchase. Choose caffeine-enriched creams and serums, and be sure to check the list of ingredients. A quality skincare product must contain an adequate concentration of caffeine to guarantee its effectiveness.\nHow to apply caffeine for eye contour care\nWe recommend applying a small amount of caffeine cream or gel to the eye contour area, patting gently with the fingertips. This gesture stimulates circulation, increasing the beneficial effect of caffeine. By incorporating caffeine into your daily skincare routine, you'll contribute to the beauty and health of your skin.\nHow does caffeine work on the skin?\nCaffeine's effectiveness in skin care is based on several mechanisms of action that complement each other and mutually reinforce the appearance and health of our skin.\nCaffeine: a powerful vasoconstrictor for radiant eyes\nOne of caffeine's major assets is its vasoconstrictive effect. By constricting blood vessels, it helps reduce the appearance of dark circles and puffiness under the eyes.

Its ability to stimulate blood circulation, reduce the appearance of dark circles and tone the skin makes it an essential part of your skincare routine. Here's how to incorporate caffeine into your daily skincare regimen.\nChoosing the right caffeine products\nThe first step to introducing caffeine into your skincare routine is to choose the right products. Caffeine-based eye creams are excellent for reducing dark circles and under-eye puffiness. Caffeine-based serums, meanwhile, are ideal for toning and firming facial skin. When purchasing these products, check that caffeine is among the active ingredients.\nIncorporate caffeine into your daily routine\nOnce you've got the right products, the next step is to incorporate them into your skincare routine. Apply caffeine-based eye cream to the eye area every morning to reduce dark circles and puffiness.

The top of each tower is 262 ft above the ground and is capped by a large housing that serves as the hub for the three-bladed generator. Each of the blades is more than 125 ft long which means that the top height of the spinning blade is nearly 400 ft above the ground. The engineers that design the windmills try to make them as tall as possible to take advantage of smoother and more consistent wind. These tall and imposing windmills can be seen by travelers more than 25 miles away.\nThe blades are designed to begin to spin in winds below 8 mph. At about 33 mph they reach maximum electricity production and when the wind speed gets above 56 mph the turbines automatically shut down to protect the blades from spinning too fast. The blades are not designed to spin rapidly with the normal rate being 10 \u2013 20 rpm.\nThese are very efficient wind generators and each unit is capable of producing up to 1.5 megawatts of power \u2013 enough to power somewhere between 350 and 400 homes. In full production, the 90 machines produce 135 megawatts which is about 8% of the total power used by Northwest energy.\nJudith Gap Blade Park\nA single blade is on display in \u201cBlade Park\u201d in Judith Gap. Be sure to stop at the roadside park to see a windmill blade on display. The park is tiny but big enough to display an actual blade from one of the windmills. These blades are marvels of construction. Standing next to the blade gives you a real appreciation for how big the windmills are. When I examined the blade I was struck by how massive and how flexible it is. The park also has a few interpretive panels that tell the story of the development. There are no facilities at Blade Park and few in Judith Gap.","metadata":{"date":1708865553000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947474595.59\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240225103506-20240225133506-00599.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.966164887,"token_count":526,"url":"https:\/\/www.montanahikes.com\/judith-gap-wind-farm\/"},"score":3,"id":"260"}
{"text":"The human gut is a complex and fascinating ecosystem, housing trillions of microorganisms that play a crucial role in our overall health. Maintaining a balanced and thriving gut microbiome is essential for digestion, immunity, and even mental well-being. Probiotics, often referred to as \u201cfriendly bacteria,\u201d have emerged as a powerful tool in promoting and preserving gut health.\nUnderstanding Gut Health\nThe gut microbiome is a diverse community of bacteria, viruses, fungi, and other microorganisms residing in the gastrointestinal tract. This complex system influences not only digestion and nutrient absorption but also immune function, metabolism, and even mood regulation. An imbalanced or unhealthy gut microbiome can lead to a range of issues, including digestive disorders, allergies, and inflammation.\nWhat Are Probiotics?\nProbiotics are live microorganisms, primarily bacteria or yeast, that provide health benefits when consumed in adequate amounts. These beneficial bacteria can help restore or maintain a harmonious balance within the gut microbiome. While there are many strains of probiotics, some of the most commonly studied and used ones include Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium species.\nProbiotics and Gut Health\n- Digestive Health: Probiotics can help regulate bowel movements, alleviate symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and reduce the risk of diarrhea associated with antibiotics. They can also assist in the breakdown of food and absorption of nutrients.\n- Immune Support: A significant portion of the immune system is located in the gut. Probiotics can enhance the gut\u2019s immune response, potentially reducing the risk of infections and allergies.\n- Inflammation and Autoimmune Diseases: Emerging research suggests that a balanced gut microbiome, supported by probiotics, may play a role in managing inflammation and autoimmune conditions.\n- Mental Health: There is a growing body of evidence indicating a connection between gut health and mental well-being. Some studies suggest that probiotics may help manage symptoms of depression and anxiety.\n- Weight Management: While more research is needed, some studies suggest that probiotics may assist in weight management by influencing metabolism and appetite regulation.\nSources of Probiotics\nProbiotics can be obtained from various sources:\n- Fermented Foods: Yogurt, kefir, sauerkraut, kimchi, kombucha, and miso are rich in live probiotic cultures.\n- Supplements: Probiotic supplements are available in various forms, including capsules, tablets, and powders. They often contain higher concentrations of specific probiotic strains.\n- Dairy Alternatives: Plant-based yogurt and kefir made from almond, soy, or coconut milk can also contain probiotics.\nTips for Choosing Probiotics\n- Strain Selection: Different probiotic strains offer various benefits. Consult a healthcare professional to determine which strain is best for your specific needs.\n- CFU (Colony-Forming Units) Count: Look for products that specify the number of live CFUs per serving. Higher CFU counts may be more effective.\n- Storage: Proper storage is crucial to maintain probiotic viability. Store them in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight.\n- Expiration Date: Check the expiration date to ensure product freshness and effectiveness.\nCaring for your gut health is a fundamental step toward overall wellness. Incorporating probiotics into your diet, whether through fermented foods or supplements, can be a valuable strategy for nurturing a balanced gut microbiome. However, it\u2019s essential to remember that probiotics are not a one-size-fits-all solution. Consulting a healthcare professional can help you make informed choices and tailor probiotic supplementation to your specific health goals. With the right approach, you can pave the way to better digestive health, enhanced immunity, and a happier, healthier you.","metadata":{"date":1709187947000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947474784.33\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240229035411-20240229065411-00299.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9114800692,"token_count":778,"url":"https:\/\/kcalorie.in\/nurturing-gut-health-with-probiotics-a-path-to-wellness\/"},"score":4,"id":"261"}

{"text":"Digital twins are a sophisticated technology that can be used to construct digital representations of complicated systems. They can be used to build physical prototypes of complex systems like electric cars and wind farms. Digital twins can be utilized to solve problems and improve the quality of a physical item and the user experience.\nHistory of Digital Twins\nDigital twins are a long-standing concept that has been commercially used for autos, jet engines, airplanes, and a variety of other mechanical systems. In other words, an item's digital presence allows it to be inspected, interacted with, modified, and shared almost anywhere.\nThe concept of digital twins appears to have evolved from the aerospace industry's need to regulate and monitor manufacturing processes with higher precision. In the 1990s, NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) co-developed the first digital twin, 'Flight Control System,' which might be considered the ancestor of the concept of digital twins.\nHow to create Digital Twin?\nA digital twin is formed by capturing an object's geometry with the most advanced sensors; and then simulating the object's behavior using the software. 3D scanning, motion capture, and laser scanning are some of the techniques used to generate digital twins.\nWhat are the top use cases for Digital Twins in the future?\nDigital twins can be used in all kinds of industries and for a variety of applications. The most common examples of where digital twins are being used include manufacturing, healthcare, energy, retail, finance, security, and transportation.\nHere are examples of some of the applications in which digital twins have been used:\nThe benefit of digital twin technology in the automobile industry is that it can be used to replicate a vehicle's performance, which allows designers and engineers to optimize the design, improve the vehicle's performance, and check the design before proceeding to the manufacturing stage. A digital twin can be used to construct a \"real-time clone\" of a full vehicle, including software, mechanics, electrics, and physical behavior, completely replacing the physical vehicle. For example, digital twins can be used to mimic a vehicle's aerodynamics and assess how it will function on windy terrain. They can also be used to imitate tire friction on the road in order to improve vehicle safety. A digital twin can be used by a designer to take a look at how a vehicle will look once it has been painted.\nDigital Twin in Aerospace\nSimulations of digital twins are used to train pilots on how to remain safe and responsible while flying. The models can also be used to predict the performance of a new aircraft before it is taken into service for the first time.\nThe digital twin of an Airbus A380 aircraft, for example, carries a wealth of information on how it operates, including details about its flight, navigation, and control systems. These parameters are saved in the digital twin, which is constantly updated with new measurements. This digital version of the physical system can be compared to the physical Airbus, providing insights into how the real plane responds to various elements acting on it.\nDigital Twin in healthcare\nHospitals can monitor their equipment and maintenance in real-time using digital twins. With digital twins, new medical treatment methods, such as regenerative medicine and cancer treatment, as well as operations and medical procedures, could be developed.\nReal-time operational analytics\nOrganizations can use digital twins to monitor their physical assets in real time, eliminating the need for in-person inspections. This enables firms to quickly repair product or service faults without disrupting customer service.\nTypically, a company designs a product, creates it, and then assesses how well it performs in the real world. The problem with this strategy is that forecasting how a product will function in practice is challenging. Digital twins, on the other hand, can monitor and forecast how things will behave in the future, providing early detection and allowing for swift repairs. They can also be used to learn about a product's life cycle and how it performs over time. The digital twin model is an important technology for manufacturing organizations to study product behavior and improve quality and reliability.\nDigital twin for retailers\nGenerally, customers used to see their purchasing alternatives by using booklets and online product catalogs. Digital twins now allow companies to provide customers with a first-hand virtual experience of their items and services before they buy. Customers may see the product in action, allowing them to make more informed decisions. This also allows retailers to create a personalized shopping experience for their clients, which reduces the time spent in the store but improves conversion rates.\nA rising number of businesses are using digital twin technologies to generate digital replicas of their physical systems in order to develop, monitor, and repair their systems. Digital twins will become an integral part of most enterprises in the future, enabling new levels of automation. It is still in its early stages, so it will be interesting to see how it develops and where it leads us next.","metadata":{"date":1709112618000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947474700.89\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240228080245-20240228110245-00698.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9377157092,"token_count":992,"url":"https:\/\/www.regami.solutions\/post\/digital-twins-what-they-are-what-they-are-used-for-and-why-they-matter-to-you"},"score":4,"id":"267"}
{"text":"Many issues can lead to behavioral problems in children. When a child acts out, the behavior is often the result of an underlying issue. Some of the problem behaviors that children will face include having to deal with a defiant child, a child that shows a lack of respect for parents or other authority figures, seems unmotivated, has attitude problems or behaves aggressively or violently. If your child exhibits any one or combination of these behaviors it may be necessary to consider treatment options. These behaviors can lead to unwelcome outcomes if allowed to persist. Zion Educational Systems(1-866-471-8579) is an informational resource available to parents who would like to know more about the issues affecting their children. These behavioral problems may indicate a more serious mental health problem such as anxiety or depression, or one of their variant mood or mental health disorders. Sometimes the behavior can be a response to unresolved issues such as anger or grief. Because children haven\u2019t yet developed a mature set of coping techniques, they usually respond to stresses by acting out. Addressing the root problems is absolutely essential in order to get long lasting, real results.\nTreatment designed to address behavioral problems in children is based on the notion that in order to make good decisions we must have good values. Children must internalize the values of respect, determination, hard work, honesty and integrity through lessons which allow them to accept these virtues naturally, if they are to overcome their behavioral issues.

Your muscles can get sore and inflamed after a strenuous workout. Fish oil helps your muscles to heal fast so you can get back to work.\nPlus, it improves your cognitive functions. If you've ever felt brain fog while working out, consider taking fish oil to improve clarity.\n- Vitamin B\nThis nutrient is also crucial for healing the tears your muscles get when working out. Vitamin B promotes quick muscle recovery, so you can work out more frequently.\nIt's also excellent at replacing the energy you lose during working out. Those who experience low energy should get more vitamin B in their system.\nVitamin B12 is often touted as a gym goer's supplement. It's common to be deficient in B12 as you age. So, you should consider this supplement if you're over the age of 60 and have an active lifestyle.\nUnfortunately, the majority of Americans are deficient in magnesium. Gym goers and athletes are especially prone to being deficient.\nWe need magnesium to ensure our muscles contract and relax well. If they aren't relaxing well after a workout, they aren't going to heal. Magnesium supplements are great for promoting sleep and muscle restoration.\nIt's also beneficial for heart health. Gym goers are improving their cardiovascular health already by working out. But, taking magnesium ensures your heart isn't overworked.\n- Flax Oil\nThe goal of many gym goers is to lose fat and gain muscle. Flax oil helps your body use its fat deposits and balance overall fat levels.\nThe flax plant is rich in omega-3s and omega-6s. Both are important for muscle building and feeling fuller longer. When you feel full, you're less likely to eat unneeded calories.\nPlus, it helps your joints stay lubricated. Anyone with stiff or painful joints when squatting should consider taking flax oil.\n- Whey Protein\nThere are a ton of protein powders to choose from. But, whey is by far the best for gym goers.\nNot only is this powder loaded with amino acids, but it causes a release of anabolic hormones. These hormones stimulate muscle growth. Basically, it makes the work you put in at the gym go an extra mile.\nPlus, whey protein gets absorbed a lot faster than other protein powders. You can take it right before a workout without feeling bogged down.\nWhen you run or jump at the gym, the cartilage in your joints absorbs the shock. Unfortunately, as you age, cartilage wears down.\nYou can boost your cartilage strength and concentration by taking glucosamine supplements. To keep working out as you age, you need to protect your joints. Without strong cartilage, your fitness goals won't be achievable.\nYou may be thinking, aren't probiotics for gut health? How are they going to improve my workouts?\nBesides balancing gut fauna, probiotics improve protein absorption. You may be taking protein supplements without adequate absorption into your muscles. Probiotics facilitate quick absorption and even reduce muscle inflammation.\nPlus, probiotics boost your immune system. Exercise can strain the immune system and lower your body's defenses. Taking probiotic supplements allow you to workout consistently and cut sick time.\nProbiotics are best taken after working out with your protein shake.\nThis supplement is rapidly gaining popularity even though it's existed since the 1800's. Kratom comes from the mitragyna plant and is often used as a natural painkiller.\nGym goers who've tried Kratom recommend you take it before a workout. It boosts your energy, improves focus, and prepares your muscles for tearing. Kratom also reduces muscle soreness and inflammation.\nYou should always follow the recommended dose when taking Kratom.\nIt's no surprise that most people don't eat enough veggies. Getting the recommended serving of greens each day is difficult. For people who don't enjoy vegetables, it's even harder.\nLuckily, greens supplements take that pressure off your diet. They don't replace your body's need for fruits and veggies, but they do supplement your intake.\nLook for greens that contain fiber, antioxidants, and digestive enzymes. And, try to avoid taking greens post-workout. They're better absorbed before your workout than after.\nWant More Diet and Supplement Tips for Gym Goers?\nIf you're a frequent gym goer, you know how important getting a nutrient-rich diet it. You also know how hard it is to get enough of every nutrient every single day.\nLuckily, there are tons of different supplements that balance your diet. If you're short on one nutrient, taking a supplement can ensure you get the amount you need.\nFor more information on getting all the nutrients you need, check out the nutrition blog.","metadata":{"date":1708608155000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947473819.62\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240222125841-20240222155841-00498.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9452789426,"token_count":1299,"url":"https:\/\/www.dietoflife.com\/10-natural-supplements-every-gym-goer-should-be-taking\/"},"score":2,"id":"272"}

{"text":"A margin in Google Docs is a page layout tool that helps to frame and define the type area by separating the primary content from the edge of the page. Before I could create this guide, I had to open Google Docs to see what the default margins were. All the sides were 1-inch margins \u2013 top, bottom, left, and right.\nMost word processors including Google Docs set the default margin size to 1-inch. As this guide will show, you can change these values to allow for more or less text on the page.\nThere are two main methods you can use to edit or change margins in Google Docs. One involves adjusting the vertical or horizontal ruler to change the top and bottom margins or left and right margins respectively. The other method involves using the page setup setings.\nWithout further ado, here are the two most common ways to change margins in Google Docs.\nUsing Page Setup to change Margins in Google Docs\nPage setup in Google Docs refers to the user-defined parameters that help determine how a printed page appears. These parameters may include Orientation, margins, page color, and paper size. To put it another way, it\u2019s a tool that allows users to change and customize the size and layout of a Google Docs document.\nThe below guide will show you, step-by-step, how to use the page setup to adjust or change margins in Google docs.\n- Step 1: Open Google Docs.\nTo be able to set or change margins in Google Docs, you first of all need to launch your Google docs document where you need to set the margins. You can either open an existing document or create a new one if needed.\n- Step 2: Go to File > Page Setup\nClick on File, a drop-down menu of functions will appear. Look through and locate the Page Setup function, the Click on it to open.\n- Step 3: Indicate the size of the Top, Bottom, Left and Right Margins\nWhen you open the Page setup window, you\u2019ll see a lot of options that you can use to make changes to your document. Under the Margins group, specify the size of the margins by filling the top, bottom, left, and right boxes with the number of inches you wish the sizes to be.\nBy default, the margins are already set to 1-inch each. You can either increase or decrease it to fit your needs.\n- Step 4: Click on the OK button\nAnd there you go. A step-by-step instruction on how to use the Page Setup settings to adjust or change margins in Google Docs.\nNow let\u2019s look at the second method in the next section.\nAdjusting Rulers to Change the Margins\u2019 size in Google Docs\nWhen it comes to adjusting the page layout, the ruler is oftentimes overlooked. Meanwhile, it is very useful for aligning and positioning the text and other objects. They can be used to control the top, bottom, left, and right margins.\nI recommend this method only if your document doesn\u2019t have a lot of content or pages. If your document is long or has multiple sections, use the Page Setup method in the previous section.\nBelow steps will show you how to use the ruler to edit margins in Google Docs.\n- Step 1: Launch Google Docs and open the document whose margins you want to adjust.\n- Step 2: Go to View > Show ruler\nClick on the View tab and make sure the Show ruler is enabled. If you don\u2019t see a checkmark before it, simply click on it to activate the ruler.\nOnce the ruler is activated you should see it in the document as you can see in the below screenshot.\n- Step 3: Adjust the margins with the ruler.\nTo adjust the margins with the ruler, hover your cursor over either the top or left ruler between the grey and the white area until it changes into a double-pointed arrow pointing in opposite directions. Once your cursor changes to this arrow, click and drag left or right to adjust the left or right margins or drag up and down to adjust the top and bottom margins.\nAnd that\u2019s how you may use the ruler to adjust margins in Google Docs.\nWhat Are 1 Inch Margins in Google Docs\nA One-inch margin in Google Docs is a page layout setting in which the space between the main content and the edge of the page is set to 1 inch for all the top, bottom, left, and right margins. By default, most word processors, including Google Docs, set the page margins to 1-inch. So, it is most likely that your Google Docs project is already set to the 1-inch margin.\nHowever, you can check to see whether or not your document is already set to the default margin size. If not, you can change it using any of the two methods above. The inch is just a unit of measurement Google Docs uses to quantify the size of the margins.\nTo check whether or not your Google Docs is set to 1-inch margins, simply click on the File tab in the ribbon and select Page Setup from the drop-down menu. Once the Page Setup dialog opens, under the Margins group, you should see how many inches your current document was set to.\nHow to set 1-inch margins in Google Docs\nUsing any of the two methods discussed in this guide, you can change your Google Docs margin sizes to any width or height including the 1-inch margin.\nBut to show you by the hand, let me briefly go over how exactly you may adjust your Google Docs margins to 1-inch for all the four sides.\nTo set 1-inch margins in Google Docs, go to File > Page Setup. The Page Setup dialog box will show up. Under the Margins group, type 1 in each one of the boxes for top, bottom, left, and right margins. Then click the OK button to apply the settings to the document.\nHow to Remove Margins in Google Docs\nThere are some instances where you\u2019ll want to remove your Google Docs margins. The most common reason why you may want to remove margins has to do with making space for more text on the page. Either than that, margins are very important in Google Docs or any other word processor and you should never remove them, especially when you intend to print the document.\nYou can remove margins in Google Docs by setting all the margins sizes to zero inches each. To do so, simply click on the File tab in the ribbon and select Page Setup from the drop-down menu. Once the Page Setup dialog opens, under the Margins group, type zero (0) in the boxes to remove the top, bottom, left, and right margins.\nAlternatively, hover your cursor over either the top or left ruler between the grey and the white area until it changes into a double-pointed arrow pointing in opposite directions. Once your cursor changes to this double arrow, click and drag left or right to remove the left or right margins respectively, or drug up or down to remove the top or bottom margins respectively.\nImportance of setting Margins in Google Docs\nThe importance of margins is frequently overlooked. It\u2019s easy to default to half-inch or 1-inch sizes for your document margins, but doing so means you\u2019re passing up an opportunity to make the margins an integral design element of your Google Docs document.\nLook at any page in Google Docs and you\u2019ll notice that the first space you see is the margin: They are critical in forming your first impression of the page.\nMargin serves the following purposes:\n- Margins help to frame and define the type area of a Google Docs page by separating the content from the edge of the page.\n- Margins are where you hold the document when it\u2019s printed, and they\u2019re a place for readers to put their thumbs, hopefully without covering the content on the page.\n- Historically, margins have been used as a place to jot down notes and they still do so in some types of publications.\n- Outside of the type area, the top or bottom margins of the page are also good places to put page numbers and publication information.\nFor your information, the type area is defined by margins, but they are not absolute. Shapes, text boxes, and pictures, for example, may hang outside the type area and into the margins. Pictures frequently spill beyond the type area, disrupting the page\u2019s rectilinear nature and, potentially, creating a more dynamic layout.\nMargins are very important in any word processing document including Google Docs. Without them, your document will look very odd. So always try to adjust or change your document\u2019s margins to suit your needs.\nI hope that this guide will help you learn how to adjust or change margins in Google Docs.","metadata":{"date":1709442032000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947476205.65\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240303043351-20240303073351-00198.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.8539350033,"token_count":1867,"url":"https:\/\/softwareaccountant.com\/change-margins-in-google-docs\/"},"score":4,"id":"274"}
{"text":"Did Manjushri, Vajrassatva or Avalokiteshvara live?\nAre Manjushri, Vajrassatva or Avalokiteshvara manifestations or special names of Buddhas or Bodhisattva?\nVajrasattva did not live in the sense you mean, because he is not a person, but he is an existent. I will explain further:\nThe form body (Rupakaya), is divided in two:\nFrom a Tibetan viewpoint, Shakyamuni was an emanation body of the Buddha. He merely showed the aspect of being born, aging, achieving enlightenment, passing into parinirvana, and so forth [but was actually free from birth, aging, sickness and death and so forth]. While the enjoyment body is too subtle for ordinary beings to see, the emanation body is seen by ordinary beings. Wheel-turning buddhas are thus said to be emanation bodies.\nVajrasattva, on the other hand, would be the enjoyment body in the aspect of a Bodhisattva. Such a body can be seen by arya beings. We claim that when an arya bodhisattva chooses to be reborn in a pure land in order to receive teachings there from other bodhisattvas, he receives teachings from actual bodhisattvas as well as from the enjoyement body in the aspect of bodhisattvas (such as Vajrasattva, Manjushri, and so forth). Vajrasattva is one of these aspects, manifestations. He is a subtle manifestation of the form body of buddha.\nAvalokiteshvara was one of 'the eight principal Mahayana disciples of Buddha Shakyamuni', that is the sambhogakaya in the aspect of a disciple. The same is true of Manjushri. The main difference between Manjushri and Vajrasattva, in relation to their entity, is that Manjushri is said to be a [manifestation of the] wisdom truth body (i.e. the omniscient mind) and not that of the enjoyment body.\nSimply, in Mahayana Buddhism, they exist. All three of them are or were Bodhisattvas and are or will become fully Enlightened Buddhas upon the completion of their vows. The qualities of a tenth ground Bodhisattva are pretty close to the qualities of a fully enlightened Buddha.\nNow for the complications:\nThey are not historical personages in the same way that, say Gautama Shakyamuni was. They are either myths, i.e. instructive fictions, or if one accepts the possibility of realms and other universes that can be known through meditative experience, then they are the Buddhas of other universes. A common \"rule\" in discussion of the realms is that there can only be one Buddha per universe at one time, with colossal gaps of time between them. So either these Buddhas are in other worlds (in one of the ten directions) or they existed a very, very long time ago. A universe can have many Bodhisattvas and Buddhas and Bodhisattvas can visit other universes through the use of other bodies (nirmanakaya).\nExistence, to me, is not so important. If they exist, they are anatman, i.e. they don't have an unchanging core, they are empty\/sunyata. I don't need them to exist with a birth certificate and the like.\nDepending on who you are reading, you get different accounts of who is a Bodhisattva (not fully Enlightened) and who is a fully Enlightened Buddha. This confusion is compound when you take into account how the Bodhisattva path is explained-- a Bodhisattva reaches the edge of Enlightenment, but holds back because there are still more unenlightened beings in the universe. By this reasoning, you personally will be a fully enlightened Buddha before the Bodhisattvas are Buddhas.\nAlso, in the explanation of what Enlightenment is, the distinction between unenlightened and enlightened might not be what we think it is. In my readings the impression I get is that if we were nearly enlightened, it would all be clear. But as unenlightened beings, the distinction between the Bodhisattva and Buddhas are more distinct than what we naively think, in fact it may be that samsara and nirvana are in some sense the same and that the Bodhisattvas and Buddhas were always the same.","metadata":{"date":1708493921000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947473370.18\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240221034447-20240221064447-00498.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9477148056,"token_count":953,"url":"https:\/\/buddhism.stackexchange.com\/questions\/13317\/did-manjushri-vajrassatva-avalokiteshvara-live"},"score":2,"id":"275"}
{"text":"Gaisce \u2013 The President\u2019s Award today launched its \u2018Maith Th\u00fa\u2019 campaign to commend young people for their resilience through the Covid-19 outbreak. Maith Th\u00fa celebrates the achievements of young people who have completed their Gaisce Award in the face of the Covid-19 pandemic and offers encouragement to those who need extra support finishing their Award activities due to the current restrictions.\nSpeaking about Maith Th\u00fa, CEO of Gaisce Yvonne McKenna says, \u201cIt\u2019s been heart-warming to read the messages we are receiving from young people across the nation who have stuck with their Award and are doing amazing things to help their families and communities during this unprecedented time.\u201d\nShe continues, \u201cTraditionally this is the time of year where up to 15,000 young people would be celebrated in their schools and communities and presented with Gaisce medals. Unfortunately, this year there will be no Award ceremonies. However, we don\u2019t want the efforts these amazing young people have made to go overlooked. It\u2019s more important than ever to recognise the contribution young people are making in their homes and communities across the country, whether it is helping at home, running to the local shops for older relatives, or singing to elderly neighbours from their gardens to provide some much needed relief from the uncertainty of Covid-19. The country can\u2019t go without this support right now.\u201d\nShe concludes, \u201cFor everyone who has completed their Awards, congratulations on your great achievement. For those of you who haven\u2019t been able to complete your Award due to the pandemic, remember we are here to help and support you in whatever way we can. Reach out to your President\u2019s Award Leader if you\u2019re running into roadblocks, or you can contact the Gaisce team directly at email@example.com and we\u2019ll answer your queries.

{"text":"New Pilot Program Will Increase the Number of Disease Screens for Newborns\nState health officials are set to launch an \"ambitious\" pilot program that will \"greatly expand\" the number of diseases for which newborns are screened, the San Francisco Chronicle reports. Currently, the state tests newborns for four genetic diseases using a single drop of blood drawn after birth, but new technology will allow physicians to test for between 20 and 30 diseases from the same amount of blood. State health officials say the new screening, which will begin Jan. 7, will help identify the approximately one in 5,000 children born with a genetic disorder, allowing the conditions to be treated earlier. \"We think this [program] will prevent needless disabilities and suffering,\" Nicole Meckley, a lobbyist for California's March of Dimes, said. Officials expect an additional 40 to 60 children to be diagnosed through the screening expansion. Program leaders will publish a report in 12 to 18 months to \"see how the program is working.\"\nWhile supporters of the pilot program hope that it will be adopted permanently, such an expansion would have financial implications for the state at a time when lawmakers are facing a budget deficit. Of the approximately 535,000 children born each year, about 38% are covered by Medi-Cal. The screening expansion could add $2 million to the $4.2 million the state currently pays each year to screen newborns eligible for Medi-Cal, George Cunningham, director of the state Department of Health's Genetic Diseases Branch, said. Cunningham added that the additional funding may depend on how many new diseases would be detected by the expanded tests. State lawmakers will have to decide by next July whether to include up to $2 million per year needed to continue the expanded screening, the Chronicle reports (Abate, San Francisco Chronicle, 12\/10).This is part of the California Healthline Daily Edition, a summary of health policy coverage from major news organizations.

{"text":"Original Arrival Plaque\nA Modern Mystery\nThe original plaque commemorating the arrival of Kunta Kinte on September 29, 1767, aboard the ship Lord Ligonier was installed in the walkway along the water\u2019s edge at the Annapolis, Maryland City Dock in 1981. Funds to pay for the plaque and its installation were raised by a local group of community citizens led by Carl O. Snowden.\nAlex Haley, the author of the Pulitzer Prize-winning book Roots, a story about Kunta Kinte and his descendants, attended the plaque\u2019s dedication ceremony. Thousands of people witnessed the historic event.\nToday, the whereabouts of that original plaque remains one of the biggest mysteries of the history of Annapolis. Within 48 hours of the dedication ceremony, the plaque was stolen by one or more unknown thieves. The thieves left a calling card stating the site had been visited by the KKK. The story immediately caught the attention of international media.\nThe local citizens, enraged over the theft, vowed to raise new funds to replace the stolen plaque. Two months later a replacement plaque was installed. While extensive search efforts were made to find the original plaque, including dredging the waters along the dock area, it has never been found. The plaque visitors see today is the 1981 replacement plaque.\nIn 1997, the replacement plaque was raised and mounted on a new pedestal which sits near the walkway site where it had been previously installed. The new pedestal was designed as one of the early components of a much larger Kunta Kinte-Alex Haley Memorial site. The 1981 replacement plaque can be seen today at its new resting place prominently displayed beside the statue of Alex Haley.\nThe plaque\u2019s message, in part states:\nTo commemorate the arrival, in this harbor of Kunta Kinte, immortalized by Alex Haley in Roots, and all others who came to these shores in bondage and who by their toil, character and ceaseless struggle for freedom have helped to make these United States.\nIt is a message of tribute to the African Americans and others who came in bondage and have contributed to the strength and rich diversity of this Nation.\nH2 aka History2 , an extension of the History Channel brand, explored the mystery of the lost Kunta Kinte Arrival Plaque in a nationally aired television show.

And while living here in LA, I've been reminded of that time and time again.\nTake, for instance, my latest observation. We've been having winter rains here in LA for about 2 weeks, or something like that. And, well, LA people can't seem to figure out how to drive in rain. If I were to create a short guide to driving in rain, it'd go something like this:\n1. TURN ON HEADLIGHTS\n2. SLOW DOWN\nSee, that's all you really need to know. But, half the people drive around like it's a sunny day. They don't seem to care that you can't even see them through the rain with their headlights off. To add insult to injury, cops even are doing this. And that's illegal.\nTo quote the wonderful CA Vehicle Code Section 24400:\n(a) During darkness and inclement weather, a motor vehicle,\nother than a motorcycle, shall be equipped with at least two lighted\nheadlamps, with at least one on each side of the front of the\n(b) As used in subdivision (a), \"inclement weather\" is a weather\ncondition that is either of the following:\n(1) A condition that prevents a driver of a motor vehicle from\nclearly discerning a person or another motor vehicle on the highway\nfrom a distance of 1,000 feet.\n(2) A condition requiring the windshield wipers to be in\ncontinuous use due to rain, mist, snow, fog, or other precipitation\nor atmospheric moisture.\nSo, it's the LAW people. Just as you should buckle up, turn on your headlights in the rain.\nAnd, it's not just the law, it's common sense.\nJanine Sine, Manager for the G.E. Automotive Lighting Division quotes an Avis traveler safety study that \"showed vehicles with daytime running lights (DRL) had a better accident record than vehicles not so equipped. It's a proven safety measure and already is the law in the U.S. on two wheeled vehicles where lights automatically turn on with the ignition switch. Obviously, they are more visible to other drivers.\"\nSo, forgive me if I sound impassioned about this, but I'm getting tired of not being able to see people in the rain.

And later on, the export situation developed where we could ship the steel right from here. We used to ship steamer load and steamer load, chartered ships, 10- and 12-thousand-ton vessels, fully loaded with Sydney's semi? finished steel, to England--before the Sec? ond War and into the war. It stopped when the British steel industry was in poor shape and their government stopped the im? portation of steel pretty well. And freight rates in Canada. We had to com? pete with plants in central Canada--we had to sell up there at the same price that they charged up there. Nobody would give us more, just because we had to pay to transport the steel a thousand miles to them. We just had to accept whatever price was available up there. So all that meant was per ton of steel produced, we got a little less money than people producing steel in Ontario. They were closer to the market than we were. Of course, we had no market up there. That is to say, we had no assured market in the '20s and early '30s. In fact, it was not until DOSCO was formed that we established subsidiary companies in that area up there--Quebec and Ontario. We established there because that's where most of the Canadian finished steel was consumed. In order to assure ourselves of the market, we had to establish those sub? sidiaries .

But they never carried through with that. They built the blast furnace--perhaps had it about 3\/4s built-- when they quit on it. They had established a rolling mill up there.

{"text":"Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is a mental health condition characterized by recurring, intrusive thoughts (obsessions) and repetitive behaviors or mental acts (compulsions). It affects millions of people worldwide, causing significant distress and impairing daily functioning. Understanding the types, symptoms, treatment options, and coping strategies for OCD is essential in providing support and promoting recovery for individuals living with this disorder.\nTypes of OCD\nOCD presents in various forms, often categorized into different subtypes based on the predominant themes of obsessions and compulsions. Common subtypes include:\n- Contamination OCD: Obsessions revolve around fear of contamination by germs, dirt, or harmful substances. Compulsions typically involve excessive cleaning, handwashing, or avoidance of perceived contaminants.\n- Checking OCD: Individuals experience intrusive thoughts of harm or doubt, leading to repetitive checking behaviors such as ensuring doors are locked, appliances are turned off, or personal belongings are intact.\n- Symmetry and Ordering OCD: Obsessions focus on achieving perfection, symmetry, or precise orderliness. Compulsions involve arranging objects symmetrically, counting, or seeking reassurance about order.\n- Hoarding OCD: Individuals struggle with persistent difficulty discarding possessions, leading to excessive accumulation of items and clutter in their living spaces.\n- Intrusive Thoughts OCD: Disturbing thoughts or mental images of harm, violence, or taboo subjects cause distress. Compulsions may include mental rituals or avoidance behaviors to alleviate anxiety.\nSymptoms of OCD\nOCD symptoms can significantly impact various areas of an individual\u2019s life. The following are common symptoms associated with OCD:\n- Obsessions: Intrusive and persistent thoughts, images, or urges that cause anxiety or distress. Examples include fears of contamination, worries about harm, or concerns with symmetry.\n- Compulsions: Repetitive behaviors or mental acts performed to reduce anxiety or prevent feared outcomes. Common compulsions include excessive cleaning, checking, counting, or repeating specific words or phrases silently.\n- Avoidance: Individuals may avoid situations, objects, or places that trigger their obsessions, leading to limitations in daily functioning and avoidance of activities they once enjoyed.\n- Impact on Daily Life: OCD symptoms can consume a significant amount of time and energy, interfering with work, social interactions, and relationships.\nTreatment of OCD\nOCD treatment involves a combination of psychotherapy, medication, and self-help strategies. Collaborative efforts between individuals, mental health professionals, and support systems are crucial for effective management.\n- Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT): CBT, specifically Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP), is the gold standard psychotherapy for OCD. ERP involves gradually exposing individuals to their feared thoughts or situations while refraining from performing compulsions.\n- Medication: Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs), such as fluoxetine or sertraline, are commonly prescribed antidepressants that can help alleviate OCD symptoms.\n- Self-Help Strategies: Alongside therapy and medication, individuals can use self-help strategies to cope with OCD. This includes stress management techniques, regular exercise, maintaining a balanced lifestyle, and seeking support from peer support groups or online communities.\n- Deep TMS: Deep Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (Deep TMS) is a non-invasive brain stimulation technique that has shown the potential to reduce symptoms of OCD. However, it is important to note that there is currently no known cure for OCD. Deep TMS is primarily used as an adjunctive treatment to help alleviate symptoms and improve overall well-being in individuals with OCD.\nCoping with OCD\nLiving with OCD can be challenging, but several coping strategies can help individuals manage their symptoms and improve their quality of life:\n- Psychotherapy: Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is a type of psychotherapy that has been found to be effective in treating OCD. In CBT, a therapist helps the person with OCD to identify and challenge their obsessive thoughts and compulsive behaviors.\n- Medications: Antidepressants and anti-anxiety medications can be effective in reducing the symptoms of OCD. These medications work by altering the levels of certain brain chemicals involved in regulating mood and anxiety.\n- Mindfulness Meditation: Mindfulness meditation is a technique that involves focusing your attention on the present moment and accepting your thoughts and feelings without judgment. Mindfulness meditation has been found to be effective in reducing anxiety and improving the symptoms of OCD.\n- Relaxation techniques: Relaxation techniques such as deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, and visualization can help to reduce anxiety and stress levels, which are common triggers for OCD symptoms.\nLiving with OCD involves managing intrusive thoughts (obsessions) and engaging in repetitive behaviors (compulsions) to reduce anxiety. It can be a challenging and distressing experience, impacting various aspects of daily life. Individuals with OCD often face persistent thoughts that cause anxiety, leading to time-consuming rituals and avoidance behaviors. The condition may cause significant distress, interfere with work, relationships, and social interactions, and lead to feelings of shame or isolation. However, with the right treatment, including therapy, medication, and coping strategies, individuals can learn to manage their symptoms, reduce anxiety, and regain control over their lives.

{"text":"It\u2019s an odd quirk of the human mind that we tend to think we\u2019re less likely to be affected a particular threat\u2014be it the flu, a car accident, or a flood\u2014than anyone else. Like the fictional town of Lake Wobegon, where all the children are above average, this is a patent impossibility: Everyone can\u2019t be less likely than the average person to catch a cold. But we persist in what psychologists call \u201cunrealistic comparative optimism.\u201d Even when we have actually encountered a threat, or been in close proximity to one, this warped sense of the probability field persists, as a report published last year shows (pdf).\nIn the study, researchers had a chance to test how people\u2019s comparative optimism changed after a low-probability, high-impact event: a tornado that ripped across Iowa City in 2006, causing $12 million in property damage. And their results were faintly comical: Everyone they polled, from students to randomly selected Iowa City residents to people whose neighborhoods had been damaged, felt both soon after the tornado and a year later that they were less likely to be affected in the future than the average person. In fact, six months after the events, people in damaged neighborhoods were actually more optimistic that they would not be affected again than were those living in intact areas. After a year, their optimism returned to the usual level\u2014but still, as always, holding that they were less likely to be affected than others.\nWhy do we think this way? Psychologists posit that such overly positive assessments are a way of building up our senses of self. We make these assessments not just when asked about our own vulnerability but also when asked how certain we are we\u2019ve got a question right\u2014when we say we\u2019re \u201c100% certain,\u201d for instance, we\u2019re usually 80% right\u2014and when assessing how good we are at common tasks, compared to other people. Furthermore, though the researchers do not discuss this particular phenomenon, once you\u2019ve survived something, your assessment of the danger you were in, or the painfulness of the process, goes down. If you got through a catastrophe once, our brains seem to assume, you could get through it again, even if in the moment you feared for your life. This peculiar and somewhat frightening effect has been studied in the context of attitudes about torture; for a look at how having pain inflicted on people actually makes them more callous, check out this great article by science writer John Pavlus.\nWhen it comes to natural disasters, though, this sort of magical thinking may actually be mostly harmless. Being hurt by a tornado is so unlikely, the researchers note, that even these optimistic respondents were actually overestimating the potential threat by more than 10 times. They estimated the likelihood of a tornado affecting them in the future as a bit over 1 in 10, while the real chance that one would strike their area in a given year was less than 1 percent.\nVeronique Greenwood is a former staff writer at DISCOVER Magazine.

{"text":"According to a study published in the Journal of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, the drug Lamivudine could palliate some symptoms of people with Down syndrome such as hyperactivity, poor memory, attention problems or speech difficulties.\nThe study, carried out by the Centre for Genomic Regulation (CRG) and the IrsiCaixa AIDS Research Institute, states that the antiretroviral, which is used in the treatment of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection, increased the cognitive ability in a mouse model.\nThis research has been carried out with a sample of Ts65Dn mice, which is the most studied animal model of Down syndrome to date. Segmentally trisomic Ts65Dn mice provide a postnatal model for Down syndrome. Cesium irradiation is used to produce a reciprocal translocation in its genome, which has some similarities to trisomy 21 in humans.\nFor four months, one group of a sample of these trisomic mice (all young adults) was treated with lamivudine dissolved in water and the other received only water. And subsequently, they were subjected to various behavioral experiments designed to test locomotor activity, recognition memory and anxiety.\n\u201cThe study is very interesting because it has addressed a new possibility of treatment for Down syndrome,\u201d says Casto Rivadulla, a neuroscientist at the Center for Advanced Scientific Research and professor of Physiology at the University of La Coru\u00f1a. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to cure Down syndrome, but it can alleviate some of the symptoms.\u201d\n\u201cThe first step has already been taken. Now we have to make the leap from the mouse to the patient\u201d, adds Rivadulla. \u201cThere is still a lot of work to be done. But it has shown the possibility of reversing very complex cognitive alterations, such as object recognition memory, when animals are treated with the reverse transcriptase inhibitor.\n\u201cThe first step has already been taken. Now we have to make the leap from the mouse to the patient\u201d, adds Rivadulla. \u201cThere is still a lot of work to be done. But research has shown the possibility of reversing very complex cognitive alterations, such as object recognition memory, when animals are treated with the reverse transcriptase inhibitor.\nIt has also shown a new possible therapeutic target, not only for Down syndrome, but also for other neurodegenerative pathologies that must be explored, such as Alzheimer\u2019s, thus opening new lines of work\u201d, indicates the neuroscientist.\nA genetic disorder\nDown syndrome, also called trisomy 21, is a genetic disorder that includes certain congenital malformations, learning disabilities and facial features. A child with Down syndrome may also have heart, vision and hearing problems.\nIt is one of the most common congenital genetic malformations, affecting approximately 1 in 800 babies and 35,000 people in Spain. People with this syndrome also have an increased risk of Alzheimer\u2019s disease because chromosome 21, which is triplicated, contains the genes for a protein that is especially relevant for this disease.\nThis protein, known as amyloid precursor protein (APP), has the ability to accumulate in the brain generating protein aggregates that cause altered brain function. The presentation of these protein aggregates is common in most adult individuals over 40 years with Down syndrome.\nWhen J\u00e9r\u00f4me Lejeune, an eminent geneticist of the last century, discovered trisomy 21 as the genetic cause of Down syndrome, he aspired to find treatments that could improve those affected by the syndrome.\nOn many occasions, he expressed his radical opposition to his discovery being used to eliminate fetuses affected by this syndrome, through prenatal or preimplantation genetic diagnosis. Today, unfortunately, more than 90% of those affected are aborted.\nThe advance we are dealing with today is a step in the direction marked by Lejeune. However, the limitations of the present work, which uses mice in which a genetic translocation that partially reproduces trisomy in humans has been artificially induced, should be pointed out.\nBut the differences continue to be enormous, as well as the correct evaluation of the changes produced after the treatment, which means that we must be cautious in the weighted assessment of the expectations of this trial. New studies, on models closer to humans, will be necessary to confirm the advances that are now indicated.\nAny progress in this direction should be applauded because it contributes to trying to improve the quality of life of those affected, instead of aborting them, which is what is currently being done mostly.\nCristina Castillo and Julio Tudela\nBioethics Observatory \u2013 Institute of Life Sciences\nCatholic University of Valencia","metadata":{"date":1709466026000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947476374.40\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240303111005-20240303141005-00699.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9529231787,"token_count":978,"url":"https:\/\/bioethicsobservatory.org\/2022\/07\/a-drug-could-ameliorate-the-cognitive-deficits-of-people-with-down-syndrome\/44123\/"},"score":4,"id":"290"}
{"text":"When you\u2019re buying a notebook for college, there are many options to consider. Some students prefer to have legal-ruled paper. They are generally narrower than standard-ruled paper and are usually ordered with a court decision. Others prefer the middle-paper format. Middle paper notebooks are common among college students and remain popular today.\nCommon ruled papers\nA legal ruled notebook is usually lined with two types of paper. The first is common ruled paper, which is a light colored piece of paper that has a line on both sides. The second type is narrow ruled paper, which is narrower than common ruled paper and is often used by people with small handwriting.\nWide ruled paper has a larger space between the horizontal lines than narrow ruled paper. Many people prefer this type of paper, particularly in schools with younger students. College ruled paper has a much smaller space between the lines, while narrow ruled paper is narrower. You can even find quadrille ruled paper, which is great for graphing and drawing.\nIn addition to legal ruled paper, you can also find a variety of ruled papers. Some of these include graph paper, which is ruled with lines of different widths and colours. The vertical lines create a grid for plotting data. Another type of ruled paper is called manuscript paper, which is used for handwriting music. The basic page of manuscript paper has five lines of staves, which can be filled with musical notation.\nSeyes ruling paper\nSeyes ruling paper, also known as Grands Carreaux, is a specialised type of paper used for handwriting. It is used in the French education system and has become an integral part of French schoolchildren\u2019s writing. For those who do not speak French, Seyes paper can be intimidating to use at first, but it can be learned in a few steps with the help of introductory books.\nThere are two main types of Seyes ruled paper. One is medium, which has nine\/32-inch spacing between the lines and a 32-mm vertical margin. This type of paper is widely used in schools and by adults. The other type is narrow, which has a spacing of one quarter inch between the lines. It is also used by those with smaller handwriting to accommodate more lines per page.\nPitman ruling paper\nIf you need to write fast, a Pitman ruled paper is the ideal choice. This type of paper is lined and formatted in letter size. This type of paper is often used by stenographers, who write in shorthand at speeds up to 300 words per minute. It was first created by Sir Isaac Pitman, who developed a system for shorthand that is similar to Gregg\u2019s.\nPitman ruled paper is available in two sizes: narrow and medium. Medium ruled paper has a space between horizontal lines of equal width, while narrow ruled paper has a space of only 1\/4 inch between the lines. Narrow ruled paper, on the other hand, is used by people who have smaller handwriting and need to fit more lines onto a sheet.\nNarrow ruled paper\nNarrow ruled paper has lines that are closer together, and therefore a smaller spacing than wide ruled paper. This type of paper is best for smaller handwriting and allows you to write more words per page. However, if you have trouble reading tiny letters, you may want to use a medium or wide ruled sheet.\nWide ruled paper is a popular choice for younger children and students, as it provides a greater distance between lines. However, it can be used for larger handwriting, so it is often used for schoolwork. Narrow ruled paper is less popular than wide ruled paper, but it is still widely used for writing in smaller handwriting. The difference between wide and narrow ruled paper is that wide rule paper has a greater vertical margin, allowing for more lines per page.\nThe Gregg Group created a specialized style of ruled paper. This type of paper is ideal for stenography and shorthand writing, which is an abbreviated symbolic writing method that increases the speed of writing. The paper is usually two columns in size and features three lines per inch. It is also used for drafting documents in a kana script.","metadata":{"date":1708777616000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947474533.12\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240224112548-20240224142548-00898.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9801871181,"token_count":848,"url":"https:\/\/www.iesingapore.com\/what-is-legal-ruled-notebook\/"},"score":3,"id":"291"}

{"text":"Researchers suggest this is the first evidence of an animal whose memory of specific events does not deteriorate with age.\nResearchers from the University of Cambridge, the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, Massachusetts, and the University of Caen, France, conducted memory tests on 24 common cuttlefish, Sepia officinalis.\nHalf of these were 10-12 months old \u2013 not quite adult \u2013 and the other half were in old age at 22-24 months, equivalent to humans in their 90s.\nDr Alexandra Schnell, of the University of Cambridge\u2019s department of psychology, first author of the paper, said: \u201cCuttlefish can remember what they ate, where and when, and use this to guide their feeding decisions in the future.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s surprising is that they don\u2019t lose this ability with age, despite showing other signs of ageing like loss of muscle function and appetite.\u201d\nHumans gradually lose the ability to remember experiences that happened at particular times and places, like what they had for dinner last Tuesday, as they age.\nThis is called episodic memory, and its decline is thought to be due to deterioration of a part of the brain called the hippocampus.\nHowever, the brain structure of a cuttlefish is dramatically different to a human\u2019s and they do not have a hippocampus.\nThe vertical lobe of the cuttlefish brain is associated with learning and memory.\nThis does not deteriorate until the last two to three days of the animal\u2019s life, which the researchers say could explain why episodic-like memory is not affected by age in cuttlefish.\nIn the study, cuttlefish were first trained to approach a specific location in their tank marked with a black and white flag.\nThey were then trained to learn that two foods they commonly eat were available at specific flag-marked locations and after specific delays.\nAt one spot, the flag was waved and a piece of king prawn, their less preferred food, was provided.\nLive grass shrimp, which they like more, was provided at a different spot where another flag was also waved \u2013 but only every three hours. This was repeated for four weeks.\nResearchers then tested the cuttlefishes\u2019 recall of which food would be available, where and when.\nTo make sure they had not just learned a pattern, the two feeding locations were unique each day.\nAll the cuttlefish watched what food first appeared at each flag and used that to work out which feeding spot was best at each subsequent flag-waving.\nThis indicates that episodic-like memory does not decline with age in cuttlefish, unlike in humans.\nDr Schnell said: \u201cThe old cuttlefish were just as good as the younger ones in the memory task \u2013 in fact, many of the older ones did better in the test phase.\n\u201cWe think this ability might help cuttlefish in the wild to remember who they mated with, so they don\u2019t go back to the same partner.\u201d\nCuttlefish only breed at the end of their lives, and researchers think that remembering who they mated with, where and how long ago, helps them to spread their genes widely by mating with as many partners as possible.\nThe study is published in Proceedings Of The Royal Society B Biological Sciences.","metadata":{"date":1708755080000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947474523.8\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240224044749-20240224074749-00698.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9790090919,"token_count":693,"url":"https:\/\/www.theportugalnews.com\/news\/2021-08-23\/ageing-cuttlefish-can-remember-last-weeks-dinner\/61934"},"score":4,"id":"298"}

It can give that extra push to land the candidate in the service of their choice or nudge them into the final selection list.\nTherefore it is imperative that the candidate spends an adequate amount of time in preparing and strategizing for the interview, especially after the mains examination is over.\nWhat traits is the UPSC Interview Board looking for?\nThe first thing to understand about the UPSC interview is that there is a reason behind it being called the Personality test. The knowledge of the candidate has already been adequately test during the preliminary and mains stage of the examination.\nThe interview is the test of the key elements of the personality of the candidate which makes him\/her suitable for the role of a civil servant.\nSome of these traits are the ability to withstand pressure, an analytical frame of mind, the ability to understand the multidimensionality of any issue as well as the agility to respond to any urgent demand of a difficult situation. Also a potential civil servant should be able to maintain his composure in a volatile situation or on provocation.\nIt is thus required from an aspirant to present his\/her personality in manner that gives the board an impression that most of these qualities are present in the said candidate.\nThis is where the role of UPSC mock interviews comes into play. It is absolutely necessary that the first time you face an interview board should not be that of the actual UPSC Personality test.\nUPSC Mock Interviews at IAS Gurukul\nThe UPSC Mock Interviews at IAS Gurukul are conducted in association with the Indian Civil Services Association, a leading think tank on civil services reforms whose members are senior, retired bureaucrats belonging to various services. The mock interviews are conducted by a panel including former UPSC Interview Board members in a carefully simulated environment so that the candidate gets the feeling that an actual Personality test is taking place.\nThe performance of each individual is then carefully evaluated and analyzed and the weaknesses and strengths of the candidate is reported back to them. Also the feedback is accompanied by suggestions on areas that need improvement and topics that require further detailed study.\nStrategy for UPSC Interview:\n\u2022 The first and very important point to keep in mind while giving the UPSC mock interview is to take it as seriously as if it were a real interview, otherwise you will not be able to utilize it up to its maximum potential.\n\u2022 Newspaper, especially after the Mains examination, should be religiously read and you should have extensive and detailed knowledge about specific issues that are frequently in news at that particular time. For example, topics like Covid-19 or the farm bills should be extensively prepared. The Hindu and The Indian express will suffice for your preparation.\n\u2022 While reading controversial topics, it is important that you develop a multi-dimensional view of the issue in hand. For example, with respect to the farm bills, you have to be aware of arguments both for and against the government\u2019s move. This will help you prepare if the board member thrown an alternate opinion at you.\n\u2022 Also it is important that at no point should you get into an argument with a board member even if you feel strongly about the issue. It is good to take a stand and put your point out, but you should also know how to diplomatically withdraw if the board member persists with an alternate ideology.\n\u2022 Unlike the mains, where you need to know a little about everything, at the interview stage, you have to know everything about specific relevant issues and areas.\n\u2022 With respect to the DAF \\Detailed Application Form preparation, it is very important that you take each and every single word in the form seriously. The word can be your name, your surname, the place of your residence or even the name of your apartment building.\n\u2022 For example, if your name is Vaishali, you may be asked its relevance with respect to Buddhism and Jainism. In fact, even the name of your college hostel can invite questions.\n\u2022 It is also important to have on your fingertips the basic statistics like literacy rate, sex ratio etc about your home state as well as any state you may have gone to for your studies or job purposes.\n\u2022 A detailed study of these cities\/states will also require you to know about the history of these cities\/states. For example, as a resident of Delhi, you may be asked about the \u2018seven cities of Delhi\u2019.\nQuestions regarding your Educational background:\n\u2022 Questions related to your educational background can also be asked and it is better if you prepare your graduation subject well as well as any current development in that area.\n\u2022 For example, as a medical graduate you should be aware about the latest development in the field of medicine, about the Covid vaccine and the controversy around the NEET examination.\n\u2022 You will also have to answer questions about why you choose to leave your graduation subject and prepare for Civil services. Although the general answer to this is generally given regarding the scope and diversity in civil services, it is best that you prepare a slightly personalized answer. You can also use anecdotes from your past that motivated you to join the civil services.\nPreparing for your Hobbies:\n\u2022 With respect to your hobbies section, it is important to research about them and prepare content for possible areas of discussion regarding them.\n\u2022 For example, if reading is your hobby, you should be at least able to name five of your favorite books and authors and know them inside out. Also, it is important that in such hobbies, like even music for example, you should be able to name eminent Indian personalities as your favorites to give the impression that you know and take pride in your own country.\n\u2022 If your hobby is cricket, a superficial knowledge will not suffice and you should be aware about the nitty-gritty of the sport as well as about any latest development around it in India as well as globally. For example, you can be asked about the Lodha Committee report.\nGeneral tips for the UPSC Interview:\n\u2022 A good practice while preparing for your DAF would be to be to keep a separate file for it and write each topic on a separate sheet and write relevant points on it as well as add points to it as and when required.\n\u2022 It is also important that you use a formal language with the board members even during the UPSC mock interviews. It is advisable to avoid any loose talk or slang words.\n\u2022 It will be more effective if you speak slowly and clearly, rather than rush through the answers in order to get more points across.\n\u2022 You should dress smartly in formal attire, which is a formal shirt and pant for male candidates and salwar or sari for female candidates. Wear light colors and avoid flashy or bright colored clothes. Wear the clothes you intend to wear for the actual CSE Interview for the UPSC mock interviews as well. The 5 member panel may suggest you about your clothing if required.\n\u2022 Work on your posture and avoid any bad habits like slouching, biting nails or shaking your legs. For this, you may self practice in front of a full length mirror.\n\u2022 It is important to make eye contact with all the board members while answering a question and not just concentrate on a single board member who has asked the question.\n\u2022 It is also important to maintain a calm demeanor and smiling face, even if you are undergoing a grilling session.\n\u2022 Do not at any point, try to bluff or state facts you are not sure about because this will lead to a very negative impression on the board and may severely affect your score. It is best to apologize and let them know that you are not aware of the answer and you will be sure to look it up when you go home.\nIf you religiously undergo these UPSC mock interviews and incorporate the suggestions given at the time of the feedback into your personality, you will be sure to have a pleasant experience of one of the most important interviews of your life.\nWhatsapp DAF-II to 7290871802\nEmail DAF-II to firstname.lastname@example.org\u00a0\/\u00a0email@example.com\nWalk-in at B-11, Basement, Apsara Arcade, Pusa Road, Near Karol Bagh Metro Gate no. 7, New Delhi","metadata":{"date":1709350991000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947475727.3\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240302020802-20240302050802-00699.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9437016249,"token_count":2380,"url":"https:\/\/iasgurukul.com\/upsc-mock-interview.html"},"score":1,"id":"299"}

{"text":"Stella Maria L. de Guia\nHow is the world coping with the pandemic? There are a million stories to tell. Some people have taken the opportunity to learn and survive the quarantine and lockdowns. Some people use it as a venue to air grievances and protests. And some have discovered new ways of learning, bartering, teaching, and of helping others.\nI have chosen four Baguio residents to share their stories: a Bookshop owner, a mother-mentor, a performer and youth leader and a vlogger. Let\u2019s read their stories and learn there is more to life than being in quarantine and lockdown. Life can be happy and healthy while staying at home or helping others. Discovering one\u2019s potential is one way to win in this pandemic\nThe good news is, the World health Organization has produced a new story book to help children from six to 11 years cope with Covid-19 in collaboration with about 50 organizations worldwide. It deals with a fantasy creature called \u201cArio\u201d and explains how children can manage their emotions during difficult situations with a fast-changing social norm called \u201cnew normal.\u201d\nLet us start with Maricar Docyogen and a nurse by profession. She is the owner-proprietor of Bookends, home to the Pasakalye group of artists, and now during the pandemic a \u201cbartering hole\u201d for donated art, creatives and paintings to help other artists. This concept of \u201cart for-a-cause\u201d started about three years ago to help an indigent patient undergo a kidney transplant. Then progressed to \u201cSketch Mo, Buhay Ko,\u201d to help other dialysis patients headed by the late journalist Ramon Dacawi.\nDonated art works are being exchanged for goods; or a painting for a sack of rice and groceries or any pantawid buhay contribution like art materials, canvass, paint or carpentry tools. Local art master Roland Bay-an, a \u201cshy-mango\u201d Igorot artist is a strong supporter. He bartered or traded about 20 of his works (supposed to be part of an exhibit prior the pandemic) for his family\u2019s needs and to help fellow Pasakalye members and indigent artists.\n\u201cI bartered my own collection. Eventually, other artists joined in like Sam Bautista, Alex Musni, Jordan Mangosan, Art Lozano, Resty Lopez and even young Pasakalye teens who made signages from scrap wood, \u201c says Docyogen.\n\u201cTo me, this is humanity being restored. I felt that the creative sector not only have talents and skills but also compassionate to help. They used their works to help out. I said to myself, I do not regret being a conduit because the creative sector is so selfless,\u201d she added.\nDocyogen continued: \u201cBarter has always been an acceptable way amongst artists. But during this pandemic, it gained more attention and support from a lot of people. It paved way for the local community to be more aware of the presence of creativity in the city. There were more pieces that went to private homes during this past 2 months than in any given year. And it made a lot of Artists survive the effect of the pandemic. Did the artists get shortchanged? No, because they knew they gained new appreciative friends while their basic needs were also met.\u201d\nNext, is Leia Fidelis Castro-Margate. She used to be the assistant publisher of the Baguio Midland Courier, now a mother of two: Amihan, seven years old, and Tala, 5, and a University of the Philippines lecturer. I asked her how she was coping with home schooling her kids during this time of pandemic. Castro and lawyer husband Karl converted her brother\u2019s room into a study room to set the mood and routine.\n\u201cInitially we just wanted to set a routine for the girls so they\u2019re not watching TV the whole day. We also needed a routine for Amihan so as not to undo her therapy. They know naman na how to keep themselves busy. Tala makes puppets and houses for her toys using tissue rolls and boxes. Now, they are enrolled in online enhancement classes in English. Just to test viability of online schooling. Nae-enjoy naman po sila.\u201d\nThe couple take turns teaching the kids. A mutual parenting effort in between work and teaching. She finds it more challenging though compared to teaching college students, especially with Math and Filipino. When done with academic duties, she does other life skills like: gardening, laundry, baking, cooking, doing dishes, even carpentry which she considers very important.\n\u201cWe move lessons all over the house,\u201d explains Casto.\nA good hint from a home-schooling mom. Remember the attention span of your kids.\n\u201cWe find that a change in location, seat, setup also gets the girls excited to work on their books. We bought new desks so they would be more comfortable. We also bought them tablets from Amazon where they get limited screen time if they want to play with it. May timer and lock yung tablets, which says \u201cyou\u2019re all done for today\u201d once their time is up. We also have reward mechanisms for them too. They work on Khan Academy Kids (learning app) or watch YouTube kids. They do get plenty of TV time after we\u2019re done with school. Madami din naman silang natutunan\u201d\nI am amazed at Castro\u2019s methodology of teaching. She says, \u201cAnother aspect we are really proud of now is conducting the virtual physical therapy for Amihan. So we fixed the living room to accommodate her therapy exercises using existing toys and things we have in the house. Teletherapy for kids. Grateful din kasi may ganung program ang A Child\u2019s DREAM. Added to all these mechanisms is dad Karl\u2019s showing them videos of the things that interest them. For example, they see dinosaurs or rockets in the cartoons they watch, then they start asking questions. So, we take those learning opportunities and supplement more. Kung may related books kami dito we show them too.\n\u201cLately, may fascination sa Australia si Tala. Amihan likes building blocks naman.\u201d\nComing in third is YouTuber Jesse Reuben Bestre.\nBestre is a youth leader, involved with the youth ministry and a member of non-government organization Toastmasters Club OSCAR. He is also a good singer and used to be a member of STAGE Theatre Company Group. His instructional YouTube channel is very helpful especially to senior citizens.\n\u201cI have been wanting to make YouTube videos in the past but fear has been stopping me. Two or three weeks ago, I realized that this pandemic is the best time to start a YouTube channel. Mainly, because a lot of people are on the internet now, so I might as well take advantage\u201d says Bestre.\n\u201cThis is also a good opportunity to be more productive. I want to teach and be a good influencer. I believe YouTube is a good avenue. At present, I am also learning a lot from what I\u2019m doing and I wished I started sooner. But it is never too late. This pandemic has opened my eyes, Just as I teach, I continue to learn good content, video editing, and others,\u201d he added.\nLast in our personalities is budding vlogger Mark Hamada.\nHamada started blogging when a friend bought ube pandesal from Bistro Lokal. He was requested to pick up an order that was placed thru the phone. The order was followed by more orders for the family because it tasted so good.\n\u201cI took a video of the bread using my phone and uploaded it on Facebook and my vlogging started from there. Some of my videos now has 2,000 plus views and counting. I get calls left and right now from different restaurants and bakeries to endorse their products. There are a lot of people ordering from them now. I actually just finished shooting NORA\u2019s ice cream last night and will upload it later,\u201d Hamada said.\nStella Maria L. de Guia","metadata":{"date":1709222102000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947474843.87\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240229134901-20240229164901-00098.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9685983062,"token_count":1758,"url":"https:\/\/www.baguiomidlandcourier.com.ph\/coping-with-the-pandemic\/"},"score":2,"id":"301"}

{"text":"Is your butterfly gland working properly? The thyroid gland situated at the lower part of the neck is responsible for the formation and secretion of Thyroid hormones. The thyroid hormones are well known for regulating metabolism, growth, and many other bodily functions. Irregular levels of these hormones can result in hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism. Now the question arises, are there diets that stimulate or sedate your thyroid gland? What exactly is a hypothyroidism diet or hyperthyroidism diet? Can we improve thyroid health by consuming certain food? Each person has a different answer for these frequently asked questions.\nThe hypothyroidism diet is fraught with controversy, but there is no evidence that eating a certain food will overcome the disease. Diet therapy cannot cure the disorder, but it can help manage the symptoms by focusing on nutrient correction and improving metabolism.\nCommon foods for Healthy Thyroid Function\nApart from thyroid medication, a well-balanced diet can improve thyroid function. You can stimulate your thyroid gland by including the foods listed below in your diet.\nSeaweeds for Healthy Thyroid Gland:\nSeaweeds such as kelp, dulse, nori, wakame are high in iodine, an essential nutrient required for thyroid hormone production. This sea vegetable having nutritional benefits of dietary fibers, vitamins, proteins can be used in sushi, soups, and salads.\nFish for Healthy Thyroid Gland:\nOmega-3 fatty acids found in fish such as shrimp, cod, tuna, salmon, trout, sardines, and sea bass can help to reduce inflammation and boost immunity. Apart from that, it lowers the risk of heart disease in hypothyroid individuals.\nEggs for Healthy Thyroid Gland:\nConsumption of whole egg is beneficial as the yolk contains a healthy amount of selenium and iodine, minerals that help in proper functioning of the thyroid gland. It is also an excellent source of vitamins and protein.\nNuts for Healthy Thyroid Gland:\nSelenium, required for antioxidant function and thyroid hormone metabolism, is found in Brazil nuts, hazelnuts, and macadamia nuts.\nDairy products for Healthy Thyroid Gland:\nFortified foods like cow\u2019s milk, yogurt, cheese, and ice cream are good sources of iodine, which helps to prevent enlargement of the thyroid gland.\nFresh Fruits and Vegetables for Healthy Thyroid Gland:\nAs early symptoms of hypothyroidism are weight gain, many people consume low calories, high-density fresh fruit and vegetable to lose weight. However, cruciferous vegetables such as turnips, cauliflower, cabbage, and broccoli can reduce the uptake of iodine, decreasing thyroid hormone production.\nFruits and Veggies for ThyroidRegular physical activity is also important for improving thyroid function. Aerobic exercise has been shown to increase thyroid hormone concentration in adolescents.\nCreate a diet chart to keep track of your daily nutrient intake. Maintaining a healthy thyroid gland function requires striking the right balance between exercise and diet. Regular monitoring of thyroid hormone levels will allow you to adjust your diet and avoid a severe disorder.","metadata":{"date":1709187113000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947474784.33\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240229035411-20240229065411-00299.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9167108536,"token_count":644,"url":"https:\/\/blog.thyrocare.com\/food-tips-to-stimulate-thyroid-gland\/"},"score":4,"id":"303"}

{"text":"Welcome to the first ever texnoforge devlog about magic system in our upcoming game Words of Power which is focused on spellcasting and interactive invocation of magic using hand-drawn symbols.\nThis post describes high level concepts of proposed magic system such as symbols, words, alphabets and sentences without going into detail about technical implementation.\nBasis of Magic\nLet's start by the most well-known of Arthur C. Clarke's three laws:\n\"Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.\"\nI'll go a little bit further and state that magic is, in fact, a technology not understood by the observer. To many, today's computers are magic in this sense and thus modern videogaming systems are magical systems that can be used to simulate magic.\nOne doesn't need to understand magic in order to use it, but one needs to understand magic in order to create it.\nI want to create state of the art magic system so I need to understand both the underlying computer magic and the magic system itself. I try to describe its core concepts here in order to gain better understanding of what exactly I'm creating.\nWikipedia defines symbol as follows:\n\"A symbol is a mark, sign, or word that indicates, signifies, or is understood as representing an idea, object, or relationship.\"\n\"All communication (and data processing) is achieved through the use of symbols. Symbols take the form of words, sounds, gestures, ideas, or visual images and are used to convey other ideas and beliefs.\"\nSymbol is indeed a very basic, universal, and powerful concept. In Words of Power, symbols are the basic atomic elemnts of the magic system and take form of visual images much like symbols of latin alphabet used to transfer this text into your brain.\nHere's a few examples of symbols:\nIn practice, a single symbol can have many different representations, for example see following drawings of letter A in various fonts:\nThis is especially important in Words of Power where symbols are drawn by user's hand and the system must be able to recognize various drawings of symbols by different individuals.\nSymbol model is a model that represents all possible drawings of a symbol and it can be used to recognize drawings that refer to a particualr symbol.\nIn current implementation, I use many drawings of a symbol to train Gaussian Mixture Model which is able to determine a probabily of a particular point belonging to a symbol. Basically, I describe symbols as probability distributions in space using multiple 3D gaussian curves.\nThis works surprisingly well for a relatively simple approach, but models can be changed as needed. It's likely Words of Power will support multiple different models for symbols in the end to accomodate various kinds of symbols.\nFor convenience, each symbol has a unique name in english alphabet. Symbol names (which are symbols themselves) make it easier to refer to individual symbols.\nLet's refer to Wikipedia once more for a definition of the word word:\n\"In linguistics, a word of a spoken language can be defined as the smallest sequence of phonemes that can be uttered in isolation with objective or practical meaning. For many languages, words also correspond to sequences of graphemes (\"letters\") in their standard writing systems that are delimited by spaces wider than the normal inter-letter space, or by other graphical conventions.\"\nIn written form, words in latin-based alphabets are usually composed of multiple letters and individual letters don't carry particular meaning (such as letter E).\nI decided such complexity is unnecessary in my magic system and thus magic words will be composed of exactly one symbol.\nIn Words of Power, words are symbols and symbols are words.\nEach word\/symbol is supposed to be associated with certain meaning\/concept and its effect in spells should be consistent with its meaning.\nFor example, Yok rune from Arx Fatalis means \"fire\" and it's always used to create fire spells:\nAlphabet is a set of symbols.\nWords of Power aim to support multiple different magic alphabets and even creation of new ones from user drawings.\nAn example of rune alphabet from Arx Fatalis:\nSpell is a specific sequence of words (a setnence) with associated effects.\nA valid sequence of words will result in a spell with effects determined by meanings of words used.\nAn example of fireball spell from Arx Fatalis:\n(create fire missile)\nMagic language is a set of spells.\nIn simplest form, magic language could be a mapping of words sequences to individual spells, but I plan to use the power of today's linguistic tools so in Words of Power, magic language will be defined by a grammar. I plan to use Parsing Expression Grammar (PEG) or similar to formally describe flexible, dynamic, and consistent magic language.\nI also plan to support multiple magical languages and I'd like them to be usable across different magic alphabets if possible.\nNext log: #2: Invocation of Magic","metadata":{"date":1708901311000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947474643.29\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240225203035-20240225233035-00898.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9267369509,"token_count":1034,"url":"https:\/\/texnoforge.dev\/n\/words-of-power-devlog-1-theory-of-magic\/"},"score":2,"id":"307"}
{"text":"Device Manager is a useful tool that allows you to do things like: find unknown hardware devices, update drivers, disable hardware components from inside your computer, and so on. To use it, you must first know how to open it. To help you, we have compiled fourteen methods that you can use to open the Device Manager in Windows 10 and Windows 11, including using commands, shortcuts, and search. Here they are:\nIn both Windows 10 and Windows 11, you can open and view the information in Device Manager regardless of what type of user account you\u2019re using. However, you can only work with the devices, change their properties, or add or remove devices if you have a user account with administrative rights. If you want to run Device Manager as an admin, then log in to Windows with an administrator account; otherwise, Windows warns you that \u201cYou can view device settings in Device Manager, but you must be logged on as an administrator to make changes.\u201d\nBefore we show you all the methods we know for opening the Device Manager, here\u2019s what it looks like in Windows 10 and Windows 11, so that you know what to expect:\nIf you want to learn how to use it, read this guide: 7 things you can do with the Device Manager from Windows.\nNow let\u2019s get to work and see the ways in which you can open Device Manager, both in Windows 10 and Windows 11:\nOne of the fastest ways to run Device Manager in Windows 10 is by using the search box near the Start button. In it, type \u201cdevice\u201d or \u201cdevice manager\u201d and click or tap on the appropriate search result.\nIn Windows 11, press the Windows key on your keyboard or click\/tap the search button on your taskbar, type \u201cdevice manager,\u201d and press Enter or click the Device Manager search result.\nTIP: Learn more about the search in Windows 11 from this guide: How to use Search in Windows 11.\nOpen the WinX menu by simultaneously pressing Windows + X on your keyboard. Alternatively, you can also right-click the Start button for the same result. Then, click or tap on the Device Manager shortcut. Here\u2019s what it looks like in Windows 10:\n\u2026and where Device Manager is found in the WinX menu from Windows 11:\nIf you prefer command-line environments, first launch Terminal, PowerShell, or open Command Prompt (also known as CMD). Then, in the window of your favorite app, type one of these three commands and press Enter:\nAll these Device Manager commands work the same.\nOpen the Run window (press Windows + R on your keyboard), and then type one of these three commands in its Open field:\nOnce you\u2019ve typed any of the three Device Manager commands, press Enter or click or tap on OK, and the Device Manager opens immediately.\nYou can also open Device Manager from the Task Manager. First, press Ctrl + Shift + Esc on your keyboard to launch Task Manager. If it opens up in its compact mode, press the \u201cMore details\u201d button. Then, go to the File menu and click or tap on \u201cRun new task.\u201d\nNext, in the \u201cCreate new task\u201d window, type one of the three commands we\u2019ve shown you:\nFinally, press Enter or OK, and Device Manager will immediately open.\nWe\u2019ve made one, if not the most extensive, collection of shortcuts for Windows. Download it, extract it, and you\u2019ll find a Device Manager shortcut in the Windows Shortcuts -> Hardware and Sound subfolder.\nPlace this shortcut wherever you want and use it as often as you need.\nYou can always make a shortcut that opens Device Manager. Follow the steps from this guide to start the Create Shortcut wizard, and when it asks you about the item\u2019s location, enter devmgmt.msc. It doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re using Windows 10 or Windows 11, the resulting shortcut is the same, and it will open Device Manager in both cases.\nAs you\u2019ve probably guessed from the previous method, the file that launches Device Manager in Windows is called devmgmt.msc. This means that you can use it directly by double-clicking (or double-tapping) on it to launch Device Manager. But where is it found? The answer: in the System32 subfolder of the Windows folder on your computer.\nIf you intend to use Device Manager often, you might want to pin a Device Manager shortcut to your taskbar or Start Menu. And now that you know where the devmgmt.msc file is, you can do that. Go to the \u201cWindows > System32\u201d folder that we\u2019ve shown you in the previous section, and locate the devmgmt.msc file. Then, right-click or press-and-hold on it.\nNext, if you\u2019re using Windows 10, in the context menu, click or tap on \u201cPin to Start\u201d or \u201cPin to taskbar,\u201d depending on where you want to pin Device Manager.\nIf you\u2019re using Windows 11, in the context menu, click or tap on \u201cPin to Start\u201d if you want to pin Device Manager to your Start Menu.\nIf you want to pin it to your taskbar, in the context menu, select \u201cShow more options\u201d first.\nThen, in the expanded Windows 11 context menu, choose \u201cPin to taskbar.\u201d\nWindows 10 and Windows 11 alike also let you open the Device Manager from the Settings app. In Windows 10, open Settings and navigate to \u201cSystem > About.\u201d Then, scroll to the bottom of the page, and click or tap the Device Manager link under Related settings.\nIf you\u2019re using Windows 11, launch Settings (Win + I), and make sure that System is selected on the left sidebar. Then, click or tap About on the right side of the window, scroll down, and press the Device Manager link found in the Related settings section.\nIf you like the old-style Control Panel, open it and navigate to its Hardware and Sound settings category. Then, click or tap the Device Manager link found under Devices and Printers.\nThere is also another method of accessing the Device Manager using the Control Panel. After opening the Control Panel, click or tap \u201cView by Category\u201d in the top-right corner. In the drop-down menu that opens, choose Large icons or Small icons, depending on what you prefer.\nYou are shown a list of shortcuts, and one of them is Device Manager. Click or tap on it.\nYou can access the Device Manager from inside another Windows tool named Computer Management. Open Computer Management and, in the navigation pane on the left, select Device Manager under \u201cComputer Management -> System Tools -> Device Manager.\u201d\nThe last method we know is based on using This PC. If you\u2019re using Windows 10, open File Explorer and, on the navigation pane from its left side, right-click (or tap and hold) on This PC. Then, click or tap on Manage in the contextual menu that shows up.\nThe previous action opens Computer Management. All you have to do next is select Device Manager on the left side of the window.\nIf you\u2019re using Windows 11, in the navigation pane from File Explorer\u2019s left side, right-click (or tap and hold) on This PC. Then, expand the context menu by clicking or tapping on \u201cShow more options.\u201d\nFinally, click or tap on Manage in the expanded right-click menu.\nThen the Computer Management opens. In it, select Device Manager on the left navigation panel.\nNow you know that you can only run the Device Manager as admin, and you know several methods of launching it. Try them out, and let us know which one is your favorite. Also, if you know other ways of opening the Device Manager, don\u2019t hesitate to share them in a comment below. We promise to update this guide based on your feedback.","metadata":{"date":1708560626000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947473598.4\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240221234056-20240222024056-00097.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.8708437085,"token_count":1706,"url":"https:\/\/www.digitalcitizen.life\/ways-open-device-manager-windows\/"},"score":3,"id":"308"}

{"text":"All 50 States Renamed For Countries With Similar Gun Ownership (Graphic by Movoto Real Estate)\nThe above graphic is interesting, but probably not very accurate due to the following (out of date figures and no real breakdown by state):\nWe started with a research group in Switzerland called Small Arms Survey and its report \u201cSmall Arms Survey 2007: Guns and the City.\u201d Among other things, it estimated gun-ownership numbers for 178 countries, including the United States (which it estimates has about 270 million guns).\nWe then took the estimate of 88.8 guns per 100 people for the U.S.\u2014which, seven years later, is likely higher\u2014and used it to calculate each state\u2019s estimated gun ownership, based on state populations from the U.S. Census Bureau\u2019s 2010 survey. (Of course, gun-ownership density varies throughout the country, but this number gave us a easy way to come up with comparable figures for all 50 states, since actual state-to-state numbers were not available.)\nThe colors do not appear to correlate with any sort of grading spectrum (top 3\u2013CA, TX and NY\u2013are orange, yellow, and green), but simply serve to match each state with a country estimated to have the same number of guns.\nThere is no reason for such a sloppy approach when we have better numbers available for gun ownership rates within each state.

{"text":"Anyone who has acquired a puppy is likely to have heard that they must socialize extensively during the first year of life. \u201cBring your puppy with you on outings,\u201d owners are told, \u201cto the park, on city streets, through neighborhoods. Introduce your puppy to cars and bikes and kids and cats and skateboards and wheelchairs and cows and\u2026\u201d Whew! Sounds like these first-year pups have an awfully busy schedule ahead of them! While it is absolutely important for puppies to be exposed to a variety of stimuli while they are young, proper socialization involves more than simply putting puppies into situations where they encounter these things. Owners should utilize a few strategies to ensure that socialization accomplishes its goals, which are to teach a developing dog to be calm, relaxed, and well-behaved in public situations and to reduce the likelihood of fearful or aggressive responses to common stimuli that the dog may encounter throughout its life.\nThe first key strategy is to watch and know your own dog. You must be attuned to how your puppy is responding to the social situations into which you are placing him or her. By disposition or due to prior learning experiences, some pups are much more timid, fearful, or shy than others. We often imagine puppies as we see them in dog food commercials: tongue-flapping, hip-wiggling furballs falling all over themselves to say hello to every person, dog, and butterfly on their horizon. Indeed, many puppies are exactly like this. Others, however, hide behind their owner\u2019s leg when they see a person, freeze or urinate submissively when they are greeted by a dog, and would nearly jump out of their own skin should a butterfly come along! To arrange socialization experiences that proceed at the best pace for your puppy as described next, you must first be observant and sensitive to his or her disposition and responses from the outset.\nYou should set up social experiences in graded steps that reflect your puppy\u2019s personality and behavior. If you notice that your puppy seems timid or fearful in new situations, you should move more slowly and deliberately in terms of the intensity of exposure than you would if your puppy is always jolly and exuberant. Pay attention to your puppy\u2019s approach versus retreat behavior and other body language indicators. When he sees a new person, for example, does your pup pull mightily on the leash, tail wagging wide enough that it shakes his whole rear end, perhaps with some excited whimpering and attempts to jump up as the person approaches? Or does she lower her body a bit, stiffening or tucking her tail, looking away from the other person or retreating behind you as the person approaches? If yours is the full-speed-ahead pup, you should get those treats out to practice the Sit\/Stay you might be learning in puppy class for appropriate greetings. Or you might work on teaching your puppy to Sit in a fenced area so that a Sit can be rewarded by you taking off the leash and letting the pup run merrily to greet a friend who is there to help you train. If your puppy is of the shyer sort, you should instead work at a distance from new people at first, playing ball with her or working on her basic obedience exercises (always with positive reinforcement \u2013 the use of punishment in the form of electronic collar or chain collar corrections during puppy training is not recommended by certified animal behaviorists or veterinary behaviorists) without requiring social introductions just yet. You might also have a friend sit down and look away casually, so that your shyer puppy can be encouraged by the stranger\u2019s less threatening position and greeting style.\nIf you have noticed that your pup is on the shyer side, you also should begin to associate the appearance and approach of people (or whatever makes your dog shy) with the delivery of your dog\u2019s most valued items or activities. If your puppy loves treats, deliver a treat with a happy call of your dog\u2019s name each time you see a person approaching. If your dog loves her tennis ball, bring it with you on outings so that she learns the ball is available when strangers are milling about. If she prefers just getting belly rubs and ear scratches, sit down with her beside the walking trail and give a luxurious 2-minute massage each time a jogger goes by. Your goal here is to teach her to be happy and excited about the thing that now makes her nervous because that thing predicts wonderful stuff for her. If you instead push this pup too far with lots of mere exposure (without systematic use of positive reinforcement and graded exposure), you risk increasing her fear levels over time.\nIt is important to remember that any puppy can develop fearful responding to new situations if those situations are unpredictable or overly frightening to begin with. Dogs exposed to generally stressful or overwhelming situations before they are ready, sometimes with owners\u2019 best intentions at socialization, develop increasing fear or aggressive responding over time because the level of exposure was too much and thus did not have a calming effect. I have heard many a tale of socialization gone wrong because well-intentioned owners took their puppies to socialize at an overcrowded market, an overbearing dog park, or an overstimulating playground. In other cases, the environment might be one the pup would respond well to with repeated exposure but the owner only introduces the dog to the situation once or twice and thus does not allow the calming effect to occur over time (in behavioral language, this process is called habituation).\nIn sum, it\u2019s essential to watch your dog, look for signs of relaxation and contained joy at every turn, and adjust your level of exposure in new situations to accommodate your pup. In so doing, you are well on your way to teaching him or her that the world is a blooming, bustling, beautiful place!\nDr. Megan E.

{"text":"I\u2019m getting back into the grammar weeds today, based on common problems I\u2019m seeing in beta manuscripts. In this case, I\u2019m talking about the subject of a sentence, and making it clear to your readers which character is acting at any given time.\nSentence 1: Chris turned around.\nWe have a basic simple sentence here with subject (Chris), verb (turned), and adverb (around). It\u2019s clear to us that Chris is the one doing the turning, because he\u2019s the only person mentioned. But what if I complicated things?\nSentence 2: Chris turned around and waved at Jim.\nWe have two people in this sentence, but it\u2019s clear that both verbs (turned and waved) apply to Chris. That\u2019s because readers read words in order, and associate action with the last person mentioned. Even though \u201cwaved\u201d is closer in the sentence to Jim than it is to Chris and they are both present in the scene, we associate all action with Chris until Jim is introduced.\nSentence 3: Chris turned around and waved at Jim, ducking a flying frisbee.\nNow we\u2019re having problems. Is Chris or Jim ducking the frisbee? Maybe it\u2019s not important in the grander scheme of the story, but it means we don\u2019t have a way to visualize the scene with any kind of clarity. Technically, Chris is the subject of the sentence and the verb \u201cducking\u201d should be attached to him. But here\u2019s the key takeaway:\nIn English, readers read words in the order they appear.\nWhile our working memory allows us to hold on to information and re-arrange things in the correct order, that\u2019s a process that happens after we finish the sentence. When it takes longer it takes for the brain to double-check meaning before letting us absorb the sentence, it breaks the reader\u2019s flow. It reduces clarity. It dulls your prose.\nSo even if the sentence above is technically correct, at least some part of the reader\u2019s mind tries to attach verbs to the most recent subject mentioned (Jim). Part of the confusion is the change of verb tense, which cues the reader that other changes, like subject, might have occurred as well. You reduce the confusion by keeping the verbs parallel and making it clear this is an ordered list of events:\nSentence 4: Chris turned around and waved at Jim, then ducked a flying frisbee.\nOf course, you can structure and edit your voice right out of your prose. Sometimes, though, confusion can clutter up and distract from your voice. The key takeaway here is that people read words in the order they appear. This is the part you can\u2019t change. What you can do is use sentence structure to compensate, tricking our minds into holding crucial information with less effort. When writing is clear, we\u2019re able to immerse ourselves in the story itself, without distraction. That\u2019s in your power as a writer.","metadata":{"date":1709544944000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947476432.11\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240304065639-20240304095639-00298.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9465062618,"token_count":644,"url":"https:\/\/joconklin.com\/2021\/03\/21\/writing-polish-going-off-subject\/"},"score":4,"id":"313"}

{"text":"The Risks of Playing the Lottery\nThe lottery is a form of gambling that offers a chance to win money or goods by matching numbers drawn at random. It is a popular pastime in many countries around the world. People can play the lottery for a variety of reasons, from trying to beat the odds to winning a life-changing amount of money. However, it is important to remember that there are a number of risks associated with playing the lottery. The odds of winning are extremely low, so it is important to know the risks involved.\nLottery is an ancient pastime, dating back to the Roman Empire (Nero was a fan). It became popular in America with the arrival of English colonists \u2013 who were introduced to the practice through European lottery games \u2013 and spread quickly from there, despite Protestant proscriptions against gambling. At the outset of the Revolutionary War, the Continental Congress used lotteries to raise funds for the Colonial Army. Alexander Hamilton wrote that lotteries were a good way to keep the public interested in politics without resorting to taxation, and the lottery was soon widely adopted by state governments across the nation.\nIn the US, the biggest lottery is the Powerball. Its jackpots are often advertised in billboards and TV commercials. They are designed to attract people with the promise of big bucks and are a great way to get free publicity for the lottery. The lottery is also a major source of income for states and municipalities, providing them with billions in revenue each year.\nThe history of the lottery is a complicated one, and there are many different reasons why it has become so popular. Its success is based on the fact that people love to gamble, and the lottery has been able to capitalize on this human desire. It has also become a way for people to escape from the reality of their financial situation.\nIt is important to understand the psychology behind lottery games in order to be able to analyze their effects on the player. In general, the game appeals to the irrational part of the brain and taps into its fears and aspirations. This is why so many people find it addictive, and why they continue to play despite the odds of winning being so low.\nThe word \u201clottery\u201d derives from the Dutch noun lot, meaning fate or fortune, and is probably a diminutive of Old English lootie, which meant the action of drawing lots. The first state-sponsored lotteries in Europe were arranged by the municipal authorities of the Low Countries to build town fortifications and provide charity for the poor, and the trend reached England by the fourteenth century. The first American lotteries were established in the early seventeenth century. Originally they raised money for local government projects and, later, for national defense and wars. They eventually evolved into a system of federally sanctioned state-based lotteries with uniform rules and high prizes. Lottery games are now a multi-billion-dollar industry, and the number of winners is constantly increasing.","metadata":{"date":1709377642000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947475806.52\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240302084508-20240302114508-00897.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9797934294,"token_count":602,"url":"https:\/\/whattheydontteachyouinschool.com\/the-risks-of-playing-the-lottery-2\/"},"score":3,"id":"315"}

{"text":"The Doomsday Clock Is Reset: Closest To Midnight Since The 1950s\nThe minute hand on the Doomsday Clock ticked closer to midnight Thursday, as the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists said it's seeing an increase in dangers to humanity, from climate change to nuclear warfare. The group took the \"unprecedented\" step of moving the clock 30 seconds closer to midnight, to leave it at 2 1\/2 minutes away.\nThe setting is the closest the symbolic clock has come to midnight since 1953, when scientists moved it to two minutes from midnight after seeing both the U.S. and the Soviet Union test hydrogen bombs. It remained at that mark until 1960.\n\"Make no mistake, this has been a difficult year,\" Rachel Bronson, executive director and publisher of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, said as the new setting was announced Thursday.\nExplaining its move, the Bulletin's Science and Security Board said:\n\"Over the course of 2016, the global security landscape darkened as the international community failed to come effectively to grips with humanity's most pressing existential threats, nuclear weapons and climate change ... This already-threatening world situation was the backdrop for a rise in strident nationalism worldwide in 2016, including in a U.S. presidential campaign during which the eventual victor, Donald Trump, made disturbing comments about the use and proliferation of nuclear weapons and expressed disbelief in the overwhelming scientific consensus on climate change.\"\nThe board criticized President Trump further, saying that \"even though he has just now taken office, the president's intemperate statements, lack of openness to expert advice, and questionable cabinet nominations have already made a bad international security situation worse.\"\nLast year, the Doomsday Clock's setting didn't change from 2015, when it jumped two notches to three minutes before midnight \u2014 the closest it had been to midnight since the early era of above-ground hydrogen bomb testing.\nCreated in 1947, the Doomsday Clock was conceived by scientists who had participated in the Manhattan Project. Initially seen as an indicator of the likelihood of disastrous nuclear conflict, it now also includes other threats, such as climate change, biological weapons and cyberthreats.\nIt's the first time in the Doomsday Clock's 70-year history that the advisory board has adjusted the clock by 30 seconds.\nThe decision to advance the clock was announced at the National Press Club, where speakers included board members former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Thomas R. Pickering and physicist Lawrence Krauss. A simultaneous event was held at Stanford University that featured California Gov. Jerry Brown, former Secretary of State George Schultz and former Defense Secretary William Perry.\n\"Facts are stubborn things,\" Krauss said, \"and they must be taken into account if the future of humanity is to be preserved.\"\nThe Doomsday Clock, physicist Lawrence Krauss said at Thursday's event, offers \"a rare opportunity to reach the global public directly.\" Urging members of the public to speak to their political leaders, he added that important decisions about humanity's future shouldn't be left to a few men.\n\"President Trump and President Putin, who claim great respect for each other, can choose to act together as statesmen, or act as petulant children, risking our future,\" Krauss said.\nHis direct comments sparked the first question after board members had made their initial statements, as Tracy Wilkinson of The Los Angeles Times asked Krauss, \"You said this shouldn't be left in the hands of one or two leaders making crazy statements. I know you mean Trump, but is the second person Putin?\"\nAs Krauss answered yes, another panel member, Thomas Pickering, added, \"Good guess.\"\nCopyright 2021 NPR.

{"text":"The \u2018Make in India\u2019 scheme launched in 2014 could be the starting point in galvanising the economic resurgence in post-pandemic India.\nThe Covid-19 pandemic has resulted in the disruption of trade and investments, especially for sectors such as tourism and manufacturing. A global economic downturn of unprecedented orders is on the cards. The over-dependence on Chinese manufacturing, especially in times like this, is hurting the global economy as China accounts for 12 percent of the world\u2019s GDP growth rate. The US-China trade war along with the strained diplomatic ties with China over the Covid-19 crisis has led to global investors looking for other countries such as India, Bangladesh, Thailand and Vietnam for shifting their manufacturing activities. In this context, the pandemic could be converted into an opportunity to make India a manufacturing hub and expand its export base that could be operationalised by India\u2019s flagship \u2018Make in India\u2019 initiative.\nThe \u2018Make in India\u2019 scheme launched in 2014, could be the starting point in galvanising the economic resurgence in post-pandemic India. This programme was well designed to \u201cfacilitate investment, foster innovation, enhance skill development, protect intellectual property and build best-in-class manufacturing infrastructure\u201d in India. The primary objective of this initiative was to attract investments from across the globe and strengthen India\u2019s manufacturing sector.\nWith regard to Foreign Direct Investment, the aim was to create a business-friendly environment for investors and help create successful interlinkages between investors, manufacturers and the human capital within the country. FDI has been on the rise since the launch of \u2018Make in India\u2019 in 2014 \u2014 in FY 2019-20 India recorded an all time high of $73.45 billion in FDI inflows. Although, the service sector has the highest FDI inflows that contributes to approximately 17 percent of the total FDI volume into the country, the exit of manufacturing bases from China will aid \u2018Make in India\u2019 targets to grow the manufacturing sector\u2019s share in India\u2019s GDP (from the current approximate figure of 15 percent to 25 percent by 2025).\nThere are however two primary barriers to this. Firstly, a point of concern remains that the production cost (mainly land and labour expenses) in Southeast Asia is 12 percent lower than that in India, prompting investors to prioritise other nations in the region such as Vietnam, Thailand, etc. Although the market size present in India might offset the production cost difference by 6-7 percent, the remaining gap needs to be made up by implementing incentives at regional levels.\nSecondly, another concern for the growth of the Indian economy is the state of labour productivity. According to an analysis of the Annual Survey of India data, India\u2019s labour productivity has been on a downward spiral for the last 8 years. The importance of highly productive human capital base is immense as it ensures effective usage of resources. With investors trying to move out of China, it is imperative that businesses and the government ensure an environment of high labour productivity through labour up-skilling in order to tap into the opportunities that lie ahead.\nWith respect to other Southeast Asian countries trying to capitalise on the current situation, Singapore has already been an early gainer in this domain. Indian state governments such as that of Telengana and Tamil Nadu are also stepping up in attracting firms to Hyderabad and Chennai respectively. Earlier, in September 2019, the corporate tax in India was reduced to 17 percent for new entrants in the market (which is lower than in Southeast Asia).\nIndia\u2019s Northeastern region should also be given a renewed focus to facilitate the country\u2019s Act East Policy, which is seen as a crucial alternative to its non-participation in China\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). The Northeastern states could potentially connect the product markets between the larger Indian geography along with the robust Southeast Asian economies, which in turn makes the Indian economy more competitive for foreign investments.\nIn the same vein, several multinational companies have expressed interest in shifting their value chains to India which will ensue in the country\u2019s growth opportunities. Japan has pledged $2.2 billion to facilitate companies to relocate their production out of China and into India. German footwear company \u2014 Von Wellx is set to completely relocate its production from China to Agra in India. More recently, as companies are bound to restart and diversify the disrupted supply chains, about 24 companies (assembly partners of big players ranging from Apple to Samsung) have pledged to set up mobile-phone factories in India which amounts to an estimated $1.5 billion of investments. India must leverage on this dilution in the Chinese dependency of developed economies such as US, Japan, Germany, UAE and France by simultaneously boosting its complementary \u2018Make in India\u2019 campaign.\nThe global economy could revive from this recession by early next year only if the supply side constraints can be contained with parallel revival in consumption demand. Analysing this in the Indian context would entail making the Indian economy more competitive by making its product and input markets robust in comparison to the nation\u2019s Southeast Asian competitors. In a post-pandemic situation, countries are expected to look towards India for processed food, marine produce, meat, fruits and vegetables, tea, rice and other cereals due to the underlying apprehension in importing edible products from China. Against this backdrop, the time is now ripe to convert India's flagship \u2018Make in India\u2019 campaign into a global manufacturing phenomenon.\nAdditionally, the Prime Minister\u2019s clarion call of making India \u2018atmanirbhar\u2019 (self-reliant) and being \u2018vocal for local\u2019 must have its foundations in increasing the efficiency of domestic production and consumption processes. At a time where there are too many uncertainties and one cannot rely on the vagaries of global trade and finance, it is imperative that India creates a very robust domestic economic system through consumption and investment demand. A potent example of \u2018self-reliance\u2019 is the domestic production of Personal Protective Equipment and N-95 masks, which reduces India\u2019s dependence on China for importing necessary equipments amidst the Covid-19 crisis. However, despite India\u2019s focus towards conversion of global economic processes into domestic mechanisms, the importance of making India attractive to foreign investments through \u2018Make in India\u2019 cannot be denied in fuelling India\u2019s growth story in the post-pandemic world.\nThe views expressed above belong to the author(s).

{"text":"Noted Dallas Mavericks fan Patrick Mahomes, a teammate of Taylor Swift\u2019s boyfriend, is going to the Super Bowl. This will be Mahomes\u2019 fourth Super Bowl appearance in five years with the Kansas City Chiefs. Travis Kelce, who is Swift\u2019s boyfriend, is also making his fourth Super Bowl appearance. This is his first time playing in the Super Bowl, however, as Taylor Swift\u2019s boyfriend.\nMahomes, who grew up in East Texas, is a huge Mavericks fan. He attended a Mavericks game back in November, during the Chiefs\u2019 bye week. Mahomes and his wife, Brittany, received signed Luka Doncic jerseys.\nMahomes has never been shy about rooting for Dallas area teams, posting his support for the Texas Rangers on their recent World Series winning run, and the Dallas Stars during their Western Conference Finals trip. Now he\u2019s the one chasing yet another NFL championship ring.\nThe cynical among you might be saying \u201cThis is simply an attempt to capitalize on the attention that Taylor Swift brings whenever her name is mentioned.\u201d Why would I do that? I\u2019m just simply reporting that Mahomes, a Mavericks fan, is headed to the Super Bowl along with his teammate, Kelce, who is dating Taylor Swift. It\u2019s just the facts. I am just reporting the relevant news of the day.\nSo in an effort to keep you informed on the latest news about the Mavericks, and their celebrity fans, like Mahomes, we\u2019re just reporting this development. For all anyone knows, Taylor Swift is also a fan of the Mavericks. No, she\u2019s not from the Dallas area, and as far as I can tell, she\u2019s never attended a Mavs game, or been spotted in Mavs gear. But she is a fan of winners, like Kelce and Mahomes, so there\u2019s a good possibility she\u2019s a fan of Doncic, and therefore the Mavericks.\nAgain, this is all speculation. Wild, irresponsible speculation. But until Swift definitely says she is not a fan of the Mavericks, there\u2019s a chance she is. So in a couple weeks, when Mahomes, Kelce, and Swift take the field for the Super Bowl, Mavs fans should be rooting for them. After all, Mahomes and (theoretically) Taylor Swift support the Mavs and Luka Doncic.","metadata":{"date":1709572976000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947476464.74\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240304165127-20240304195127-00598.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9644604921,"token_count":509,"url":"https:\/\/www.mavsmoneyball.com\/2024\/1\/28\/24053939\/mavericks-fan-patrick-mahomes-taylor-swifts-boyfriend-super-bowl-travis-kelce"},"score":0,"id":"328"}

She is teaching students how to use the science of cognitive learning to maximize their study effectiveness.\nWhile the full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on higher education has yet to be seen, the severity of the ongoing nursing shortage and the rigor of nursing programs present the urgent need for innovative solutions to support nursing faculty and build nursing student academic resilience. \"Lecturio has developed a corporate culture that uses the synergy of designers, filmmakers, subject-matter experts, and passionate educators to create curriculum, teaching materials, and evaluation measures based on learning science.

It is home to a dome with a transept, three apses and an interior covered with barrel vaults. The cover is guarded by two columns with a finish of Visigothic capitals made of marble. On the tympanum is a representation of Jesus escorted by the apostles Saint Peter and Saint Paul, with an inscription inviting visitors to enter.\nThe cloister of the monastery is small and was built in the 13th century. Currently, it has a single entrance, which has multi-lobed arches. These arches are supported on germinated columns with beautifully decorated capitals topped with Biblical motifs, hunting scenes, warriors, mermaids, animals, monsters and plant motifs.\nAround the monastery is a large garden with an ancient abbey house, whose construction took place during the 13th and 14th centuries and was completed in the 18th century.\nIn the chapter house of the monastery, which dates from the 14th century, the tombstone of Count Wilfredo II of Barcelona is located. He is presumed to be the founder of the order and his wish was to be buried in the monastery. This took place in the year 911.","metadata":{"date":1709565552000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947476452.25\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240304133241-20240304163241-00899.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9675918221,"token_count":349,"url":"https:\/\/mycities.es\/en\/barcelona\/info\/4490-religious-buildings\/monastery-of-sant-pau-del-camp"},"score":3,"id":"331"}
{"text":"Supplements for Optimal Muscle Gain and Weight Loss: What Works Best?\nIf you're looking to build lean muscle mass or lose weight, supplements can be a helpful addition to your fitness routine. However, with so many options on the market, it can be tough to determine which supplements are truly effective. In this article, we'll dive into the science behind muscle gain and weight loss supplements and explore the best options for achieving your fitness goals.\nThe Science Behind Muscle Gain and Weight Loss Supplements\nBefore delving into specific supplements, it's important to understand the role they play in the body. Supplements work by providing key nutrients that support muscle growth and weight loss. Some supplements help to increase protein synthesis, while others aid in metabolism or reduce inflammation.\nWhile supplements can provide a boost to your fitness routine, it's essential to remember that they're not a substitute for regular exercise and a healthy diet. Instead, consider supplements as a way to enhance your efforts and reach your fitness goals more quickly.\nIt's also important to note that not all supplements are created equal. Some may contain harmful ingredients or have misleading labels. It's crucial to do your research and choose supplements from reputable brands that have been tested for safety and efficacy. Additionally, it's recommended to consult with a healthcare professional before starting any new supplement regimen, especially if you have any underlying health conditions or are taking medication.\nThe Role of Protein in Muscle Gain and Weight Loss\nProtein is a crucial component of any fitness plan, as it's essential for muscle repair and growth. Additionally, protein can aid in weight loss by keeping you feeling full and preventing overeating. If you're looking to build lean muscle mass, consider supplementing with protein powders or bars. Whey protein is a common option, but if you're vegan or lactose intolerant, consider alternatives like pea or soy protein.\nIt's important to note that while protein is essential for muscle gain and weight loss, it's not the only factor to consider. A well-rounded fitness plan should also include regular exercise, a balanced diet, and adequate rest and recovery time. Additionally, it's important to consult with a healthcare professional or registered dietitian before making any significant changes to your diet or exercise routine.\nUnderstanding the Importance of Carbohydrates in Muscle Building\nCarbohydrates are often demonized in the fitness world, but they play a vital role in muscle building. Carbs provide energy for workouts and help to stimulate muscle growth. If you're looking to increase muscle mass, aim for complex carbohydrates like sweet potatoes, quinoa, and brown rice. If you're in need of a quick energy boost before a workout, simple carbs like fruit or honey can provide a quick source of fuel.\nIt's important to note that not all carbohydrates are created equal. Highly processed carbs like white bread and sugary snacks can lead to spikes in blood sugar levels and ultimately hinder muscle growth. It's best to stick to whole, unprocessed carbs to ensure a steady release of energy and optimal muscle building.\nIn addition to providing energy for workouts, carbohydrates also play a role in post-workout recovery. Consuming carbs after a workout helps to replenish glycogen stores in the muscles, which can aid in muscle repair and growth. Pairing carbs with protein after a workout can further enhance muscle recovery and growth.\nThe Role of Fats in Muscle Gain and Weight Loss\nFats often get a bad reputation, but certain types of fats can be beneficial for muscle gain and weight loss. Monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats are crucial for hormone production and brain function, while saturated fats should be limited. Supplementing with fish oil or other sources of omega-3 fatty acids can help to reduce inflammation and promote weight loss.\nIt is important to note that not all fats are created equal. Trans fats, found in processed foods, should be avoided altogether as they have been linked to numerous health problems. Additionally, consuming too many calories from any type of fat can lead to weight gain, so it is important to consume fats in moderation.\nWhile fats are important for overall health, it is also important to incorporate a balanced diet that includes protein and carbohydrates. Consuming a diet that is high in protein can help to build and repair muscle tissue, while carbohydrates provide energy for workouts and daily activities. By combining a balanced diet with regular exercise, individuals can achieve their muscle gain and weight loss goals.\nTop Supplements for Building Lean Muscle Mass\nWhen it comes to muscle gain, there are several key supplements to consider. Creatine is a popular choice, as it helps to increase muscle strength and size. Beta-alanine, which can be found in pre-workout supplements, can also boost endurance and reduce fatigue. Additionally, branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) can help to reduce muscle breakdown and increase protein synthesis.\nAnother supplement that has gained popularity in recent years is whey protein. Whey protein is a fast-digesting protein that can help to increase muscle protein synthesis and promote muscle growth. It is often used as a post-workout supplement to aid in muscle recovery.\nIn addition to supplements, it is important to maintain a balanced diet and engage in regular exercise to build lean muscle mass. Consuming enough protein, carbohydrates, and healthy fats can provide the necessary nutrients for muscle growth. Resistance training, such as weightlifting, can also help to stimulate muscle growth and increase strength.\nThe Best Supplements for Accelerating Weight Loss\nFor those looking to shed unwanted pounds, there are several supplements that can help to accelerate weight loss. Green tea extract is a natural fat burner that can increase metabolism and reduce appetite. Garcinia cambogia is another popular option, as it helps to block the production of fat and reduce cravings. Additionally, caffeine is a natural stimulant that can boost energy and help burn fat.\nHowever, it is important to note that supplements should not be relied upon as the sole method for weight loss. A healthy diet and regular exercise are crucial components for achieving and maintaining a healthy weight. It is also important to consult with a healthcare professional before starting any new supplement regimen.\nIn addition to the aforementioned supplements, there are other natural options that can aid in weight loss. Apple cider vinegar has been shown to reduce appetite and increase feelings of fullness, while also improving digestion. Another option is probiotics, which can help to regulate gut health and improve metabolism.\nNatural Supplements for Muscle Gain and Weight Loss\nIf you prefer a natural approach to supplementation, there are several options to consider. Turmeric, for example, has anti-inflammatory properties that can aid in muscle recovery. Additionally, ashwagandha is an adaptogenic herb that can help to reduce stress and promote muscle growth. Finally, green tea extract contains natural caffeine and antioxidants that can boost energy and metabolism.\nIt is important to note that while natural supplements can be beneficial, they should not be relied upon as the sole method for achieving muscle gain and weight loss. A balanced diet and regular exercise routine are also crucial components for achieving these goals. Additionally, it is recommended to consult with a healthcare professional before starting any new supplement regimen.\nThe Dos and Don'ts of Supplementing for Optimal Results\nWhen it comes to supplementation, there are several dos and don'ts to keep in mind. Do research any supplements before trying them, and be cautious of marketing claims that seem too good to be true. Don't rely solely on supplements to achieve your fitness goals - they're meant to complement a healthy diet and regular exercise routine. Finally, do pay attention to dosage and follow recommended guidelines to avoid negative side effects.\nAnother important \"do\" when it comes to supplementing is to consult with a healthcare professional before adding any new supplements to your routine. This is especially important if you have any pre-existing medical conditions or are taking any medications, as certain supplements can interact with prescription drugs or exacerbate certain health issues.\nOn the other hand, a common \"don't\" when it comes to supplementation is to assume that more is always better. Taking excessive amounts of certain supplements can actually be harmful to your health, and may even lead to toxicity or overdose. Always stick to recommended dosages and avoid taking multiple supplements that contain the same ingredients.\nTips for Maximizing the Benefits of Your Supplements\nTo get the most out of your supplements, there are several tips to keep in mind. First, stay consistent with your supplement routine to give your body time to adjust and see results. Additionally, be sure to stay hydrated and eat a balanced diet to support your fitness goals. Finally, track your progress over time to see which supplements are truly effective for your body.\nIt's important to note that supplements should not be relied upon as a substitute for a healthy lifestyle. While they can provide additional support for your fitness goals, they should be used in conjunction with a balanced diet and regular exercise. It's also important to consult with a healthcare professional before starting any new supplement regimen, especially if you have any underlying health conditions or are taking medication.\nHow to Choose the Right Supplement for Your Body Type\nChoosing the right supplement can be a challenge, as different body types may require different types of supplementation. Consider your fitness goals and any nutritional deficiencies you may have. If you struggle to get enough protein in your diet, protein supplements may be a good choice. If you're looking to reduce inflammation, try supplements like turmeric or fish oil. Finally, be sure to read reviews and do research to find the supplements that work best for your body.\nUnderstanding the Side Effects of Popular Supplements\nWhile many supplements are safe and effective, others can have negative side effects. For example, creatine can cause dehydration and muscle cramps, while excessive caffeine consumption can lead to jitters and insomnia. Be sure to follow recommended dosages and keep an eye out for any unusual symptoms. If you experience negative side effects, discontinue use immediately.\nThe Importance of a Balanced Diet When Using Supplements for Muscle Gain and Weight Loss\nSupplements can be a helpful addition to your fitness routine, but they should never replace a healthy diet. Aim for a balance of protein, healthy fats, and complex carbohydrates to provide your body with the nutrients it needs to thrive. Additionally, be sure to stay hydrated and limit processed foods and sugar.\nHow to Incorporate Supplements into Your Fitness Routine for Maximum Results\nTo get the most out of your supplements, incorporate them into a well-rounded fitness routine. Be sure to get enough sleep, exercise regularly, and eat a healthy diet. Additionally, listen to your body and adjust your supplement routine as needed. By combining supplements with healthy lifestyle habits, you can achieve optimal muscle gain and weight loss results.\nWith the right supplements and a healthy routine, you can achieve your fitness goals and feel your best. Remember to do your research, stay consistent, and prioritize balanced nutrition and exercise habits.","metadata":{"date":1709302270000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947475311.93\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240301125520-20240301155520-00299.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9496282339,"token_count":2239,"url":"https:\/\/atlasbars.com\/blogs\/muscle-explained\/supplements-for-optimal-muscle-gain-and-weight-loss-what-works-best"},"score":2,"id":"332"}
{"text":"Review: GPS Declassified: From Smart Bombs to Smartphones\nby William F. Mellberg\n|Space enthusiasts will enjoy reading about some little-known chapters in space history: episodes that were once shrouded in Pentagon secrecy, but which eventually led to things that most of us now take for granted, like the GPS units in today\u2019s cars.\nToday\u2019s drivers don\u2019t have to worry about cloudy skies or locating the North Star to guide their path. A whole new constellation of man-made \u201cstars\u201d now orbits our Earth, providing travelers with precise locations and directions through the revolutionary Global Positioning System (GPS). GPS Declassified describes in fascinating detail some of the navigation techniques that were employed prior to GPS, the Space Age events that paved the way to GPS, the development of GPS, and the assorted applications of GPS in today\u2019s society. It also tells the inside stories of the people who created GPS, including Roger Easton, the father of co-author Richard Easton.\nDespite the highly technical nature of the subject matter, GPS Declassified is totally accessible to any reader with a modest interest in science, technology, history, and culture. The authors use plain English and employ a largely chronological approach that is easy to follow. Space enthusiasts will enjoy reading about some little-known chapters in space history: episodes that were once shrouded in Pentagon secrecy, but which eventually led to things that most of us now take for granted, like the GPS units in today\u2019s cars.\nTen chapters guide the reader from the ancient Greeks and 18th Century mariners to early Space Age pioneers and (as the subtitle suggests) modern smartphones. The authors repeat themselves in a few places. This is not a criticism. Easton and Frazier simply remind us of some things mentioned earlier in the book, reminders which I found very useful. There is a lot of material packed between the covers of this tome, and there could have been even more. Again, this is not a criticism. So many interesting tidbits are included that I frequently found myself going to my bookshelf or searching the Internet for additional information. Here are three examples:\nOne: Captain James Cook was able to determine his longitude while exploring Pacific islands by observing and timing the motions of Jupiter\u2019s Galilean satellites. (And to think that I always thought those tables were published in nautical almanacs simply for the benefit of amateur astronomers like myself!)\nTwo: The downing of Korean Air Lines Flight 007 in 1983 precipitated the civil use of GPS. Had that Boeing 747 been equipped with GPS instead of INS, it is unlikely the crew would have strayed over restricted Soviet airspace, which is why President Reagan approved the use of the Pentagon\u2019s GPS for civilian airliners and other commercial applications.\nThree: Actress Hedy Lamarr and pianist-composer George Antheil invented the spread-spectrum signal structure during World War II. As the authors note, \u201cThey deserve at least some of the credit for the signal used by GPS.\u201d\nThe invention of GPS takes up a good portion of the book, and co-author Richard Easton is in an excellent position to tell his father\u2019s story. He was a youngster when Roger Easton, a scientist at the Naval Research Laboratory, helped develop the Vanguard satellites and invented the Minitrack tracking system, which determined their orbits. That work led to Easton\u2019s invention of the Naval Space Surveillance System (NAVPASUR) to detect Soviet spy satellites. That system, in turn, led to Roger Easton\u2019s invention of GPS.\n|The path from Vanguard I to Timation I\u2014an experimental satellite designed by Easton and launched in 1967 to test his ideas for a Global Positioning System\u2014was a long one. Inter-service rivalries between the Navy and Air Force made the effort even more difficult.\nBeing a space historian myself, the authors really held my attention through the first half of the book as they recounted those early years of the Space Age. Project Vanguard is often depicted as a failure because of the launch pad explosion that took place on December 6, 1957, two months after the Soviet Union put the world\u2019s first artificial Earth satellite into space. But, Vanguard was really a great success, and it represented an innovative approach to designing and tracking scientific satellites. Vanguard I, as the authors note, is still in orbit today. A mere fifteen years separated the launch of the \u201cgrapefruit-sized\u201d Vanguard I and Apollo 17\u2014the last human voyage to the Moon. What a remarkable fifteen years that was.\nThe path from Vanguard I to Timation I\u2014an experimental satellite designed by Easton and launched in 1967 to test his ideas for a Global Positioning System\u2014was a long one. Inter-service rivalries between the Navy and Air Force made the effort even more difficult, as the authors describe in detail. The second half of the book recalls the evolution from military to commercial use of GPS. It also describes the constellation of satellites required to make GPS work. At least four satellites must cover every spot on Earth, 24 hours a day. Currently, a network of 30 satellites makes that possible. Each of the satellites is equipped with an atomic clock (another Roger Easton innovation) because the system depends on extreme accuracy in measuring time and distance. The first civilian application of GPS was for land surveying\u2014something Easton envisioned during the Vanguard era when he talked about using satellites for geodetic purposes.\nThe 1991 Gulf War provided the first real test of GPS for guiding smart bombs. The same technology that was used to accurately find targets could also be used to locate troops caught behind enemy lines. The authors recall the dramatic story of downed F-16 pilot Scott O\u2019Grady\u2019s daring rescue from Bosnia in 1995. GPS was also being used for commercial aviation by that time, as well as in agriculture and highway navigation. Just as GPS was employed to locate Captain O\u2019Grady, it is now used to find lost hikers. Of course, smartphones have become commonplace, too\u2014thanks to GPS.\nGPS Declassified is a carefully researched, well written, fast-paced, and thoroughly enjoyable book. It offers an excellent mix of science, technology, history and culture. Kudos to co-authors Richard Easton and Eric Frazier for their outstanding contribution to space history. This book is highly recommended.","metadata":{"date":1708502726000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947473401.5\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240221070402-20240221100402-00598.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9537474513,"token_count":1322,"url":"https:\/\/www.thespacereview.com\/article\/2393\/1"},"score":3,"id":"333"}

{"text":"In simple terms, environment refers to the surroundings, external objects, influences or circumstances under which someone or something exists. Famous management scientist Keith Davis has defined environment as \u201cthe aggregate of all conditions, events and influences that surround and affect it.\u201d\nWe do not include internal environment while discussing environment for the simple reason that internal environment is controllable but external environment is non-controllable.\nCharacteristics of Business Environment:\nThe following are the major characteristics of Business Environment:\n1. It is a sum total of both internal and external forces.\n2. It includes specific (to the firm) as well as general forces (Common to all firms).\n3. It is dynamic (always changing) in nature.\n4. Since prediction of future is difficult, it is always uncertain.\n5. It varies from region to region due to STEEPLE.\nMore specific aims\/Importance is to:\n- Understand the importance of a business environment\nAll organisations must work within their business environment, which consists of all the external factors that affect its operations, but which it cannot control. This is a very complex concept, with many competing stakeholders. Managers have to asses their environment, and then design a strategy that allows the organisation to work successfully within it.\n- Describe the factors that form an environment\nThe environment is a complex combination of the economic system, political system, legal restraints, society, industry, labour relations, customer expectations, markets, competition, technology, culture, history, infrastructure, state of the economy, shareholder demands, natural environment, labour conditions, and so on. We can classify these factors into five categories of the physical environment, political and legal factors, economic factors, social and socio-cultural factors, and technological factors. Alternatively we can consider inherent or macro factors that give the infrastructure and framework, and competitive or micro factors that are set by the industry and market.\n- Appreciate the economic context of operations.\nThe type of economic system is probably the dominant factor in an organisation\u2019s macro environment, as it defines the basic relationships between supply and demand. We assume that most organisations work in some kind of market economy. Then economic analyses give a lot of essential information about costs, supply, demand, competition, and so on.\n- Discuss the concept of an industry and the features that make it attractive to an organisation.\nAn industry is a group of organisations that use similar resources to make equivalent products to satisfy the same customer demand. When planning its products, an organisation implicitly makes a choice about the industry it works in. many features can make an industry attractive, including the size of market, financial performance, type of products, point in their life cycles, number and features of customers, patterns of demand, state of competitors, basis of competition, resource requirements, efficiency, economies of scale, levels of technology, seasonal variations, entry and exit barriers, relations in the supply chain, risks, and so on.\n- Discuss the concept of a market and the features that make it attractive to an organisation.\nThe market is the set of customers who buy \u2013 or might buy \u2013 a particular type of product. As a rule, organisations do not like working in markets that are aggressively competitive. This means that in more attractive markets Porter\u2019s five competitive forces are all weak \u2013 in other words, there is little competition from existing organisations, weak suppliers and customers, and low chance of substitute products and new entrants. But the market does not have to look like this, and a well-designed strategy can allow an organisation to succeed in even the most hostile market.\n- Consider the ways that managers respond to changes in the environment.\nThere are continuous changes in the environment and managers have to make appropriate responses. In effect, they have to assess potential events in the future, and then make decisions based on the likelihood of these events occurring, and the consequences if they do occur. Several analyses can help here, particularly decision rules and expected values (or utilities). Then the chapter lists nine possible reactions, ranging from ignoring potential changes (particularly if they are unlikely to happen or if the consequences are minor) to moving to another environment (if changes are very likely to happen and have serious consequences).\nTypes of Environments:\n1. Macro\/Contextual\/General and Task Environments:\nIn terms of levels, environment can be categorized as general environment (also known as the societal environment, the far environment or the macro environment) and task environment. Forces in the general environment have a major impact at the level of the industry.\nThese forces include national culture, including historical background, ideologies and values; scientific and technological developments; the level of education; legal and political processes; demographic factors; available resources, the international environment; and the general economic, social and industrial structure of the country. The task environment covers the forces relevant to an individual organization within an industry. These include consumers, suppliers, competitors, regulators, the local labour market, and specific technologies.\n2. Micro\/Immediate\/Operational Environment\nAn organization\u2019s internal environment is composed of the elements within the organization, including current employees, management, and especially corporate culture, which defines employee behavior. Although some elements affect the organization as a whole, others affect only the manager. A manager\u2019s philosophical or leadership style directly impacts employees. Traditional managers give explicit instructions to employees, while progressive managers empower employees to make many of their own decisions. Changes in philosophy and\/or leadership style are under the control of the manager. The following sections describe some of the elements that make up the internal environment.\nAn organization\u2019s mission statement describes what the organization stands for and why it exists. It explains the overall purpose of the organization and includes the attributes that distinguish it from other organizations of its type.\nA mission statement should be more than words on a piece of paper; it should reveal a company\u2019s philosophy, as well as its purpose. This declaration should be a living, breathing document that provides information and inspiration for the members of the organization. A mission statement should answer the questions, \u201cWhat are our values?\u201d and \u201cWhat do we stand for?\u201d This statement provides focus for an organization by rallying its members to work together to achieve its common goals.\nBut not all mission statements are effective in America\u2019s businesses. Effective mission statements lead to effective efforts. In today\u2019s quality\u2010conscious and highly competitive environments, an effective mission statement\u2019s purpose is centered on serving the needs of customers. A good mission statement is precise in identifying the following intents of a company:\nCustomers \u2014 who will be served\nProducts\/services \u2014 what will be produced\nLocation \u2014 where the products\/services will be produced\nPhilosophy \u2014 what ideology will be followed\nCompany policies are guidelines that govern how certain organizational situations are addressed. Just as colleges maintain policies about admittance, grade appeals, prerequisites, and waivers, companies establish policies to provide guidance to managers who must make decisions about circumstances that occur frequently within their organization. Company policies are an indication of an organization\u2019s personality and should coincide with its mission statement.\nThe formal structure of an organization is the hierarchical arrangement of tasks and people. This structure determines how information flows within the organization, which departments are responsible for which activities, and where the decision\u2010making power rests.\nSome organizations use a chart to simplify the breakdown of its formal structure. This organizational chart is a pictorial display of the official lines of authority and communication within an organization.\nThe organizational culture is an organization\u2019s personality. Just as each person has a distinct personality, so does each organization. The culture of an organization distinguishes it from others and shapes the actions of its members.\nFour main components make up an organization\u2019s culture:\nRites and rituals\nValues are the basic beliefs that define employees\u2019 successes in an organization. For example, many universities place high values on professors being published. If a faculty member is published in a professional journal, for example, his or her chances of receiving tenure may be enhanced. The university wants to ensure that a published professor stays with the university for the duration of his or her academic career \u2014 and this professor\u2019s ability to write for publications is a value.\nThe second component is heroes. A hero is an exemplary person who reflects the image, attitudes, or values of the organization and serves as a role model to other employees. A hero is sometimes the founder of the organization (think Sam Walton of Wal\u2010Mart). However, the hero of a company doesn\u2019t have to be the founder; it can be an everyday worker, such as hard\u2010working paralegal Erin Brockovich, who had a tremendous impact on the organization.\nRites and rituals, the third component, are routines or ceremonies that the company uses to recognize high\u2010performing employees. Awards banquets, company gatherings, and quarterly meetings can acknowledge distinguished employees for outstanding service. The honorees are meant to exemplify and inspire all employees of the company during the rest of the year.\nThe final component, the social network, is the informal means of communication within an organization. This network, sometimes referred to as the company grapevine, carries the stories of both heroes and those who have failed. It is through this network that employees really learn about the organization\u2019s culture and values.\nA byproduct of the company\u2019s culture is the organizational climate. The overall tone of the workplace and the morale of its workers are elements of daily climate. Worker attitudes dictate the positive or negative \u201catmosphere\u201d of the workplace. The daily relationships and interactions of employees are indicative of an organization\u2019s climate.\nResources are the people, information, facilities, infrastructure, machinery, equipment, supplies, and finances at an organization\u2019s disposal. People are the paramount resource of all organizations. Information, facilities, machinery equipment, materials, supplies, and finances are supporting, nonhuman resources that complement workers in their quests to accomplish the organization\u2019s mission statement. The availability of resources and the way that managers value the human and nonhuman resources impact the organization\u2019s environment.\nPhilosophy of management is the manager\u2019s set of personal beliefs and values about people and work and as such, is something that the manager can control. McGregor emphasized that a manager\u2019s philosophy creates a self\u2010fulfilling prophecy. Theory X managers treat employees almost as children who need constant direction, while Theory Y managers treat employees as competent adults capable of participating in work\u2010related decisions. These managerial philosophies then have a subsequent effect on employee behavior, leading to the self\u2010fulfilling prophecy. As a result, organizational philosophies and managerial philosophies need to be in harmony.\nThe number of coworkers involved within a problem\u2010solving or decision\u2010making process reflects the manager\u2019s leadership style. Empowerment means delegating to subordinates decision\u2010making authority, freedom, knowledge, autonomy, and skills. Fortunately, most organizations and managers are making the move toward the active participation and teamwork that empowerment entails.\nWhen guided properly, an empowered workforce may lead to heightened productivity and quality, reduced costs, more innovation, improved customer service, and greater commitment from the employees of the organization. In addition, response time may improve, because information and decisions need not be passed up and down the hierarchy. Empowering employees makes good sense because employees closest to the actual problem to be solved or the customer to be served can make the necessary decisions more easily than a supervisor or manager removed from the scene.\nEnvironment Scanning and Strategic Management\nA business manager operates in an environment and studies the variables to attain good result. These termed as environment scanning or analysis. At the same time, environment scanning points towards interaction among environment factors. According to Stephen Robbins, \u201cEnvironment scanning entails scrutinising the environment to identify action by competitors, government, union and the like that might impinge on the organisation\u2019s operations.\u201d Environment scanning is a step towards corporate planning which fall in the domain of strategic management. describes strategic management as \u201cThe determination of the basic long-term goals and objectives of an enterprise and the adoption of courses of action and allocation of resources necessary to carry out these goals.\u201d Strategic management or business policy is, thus, the means to achieve the organisational purpose.\nThe process of strategic management involves determining the mission and objectives, analysis of the environment opportunities and threats and evaluating the strength and weaknesses of the firm to tap the opportunities or to combat the threat, formulating strategies to achieve the objectives of the organisation. Thus, environment scanning leads to a formulation of sound and effective organisational and managerial strategies by coping with the probable demands of the environment and to a great extent it helps to reduce uncertainty.\nTechniques of Environment Scanning\/Analysis\nWilliam F Glueck has mentioned the following techniques of environment scanning\n- Verbal and Written Information\nEnvironmental information can easily be obtained by industrial journals, bussiness magazines, published and unpublished materials, talk shows, consultants, seminars and customers etc. The information available from such source provides an authentic information about the environment around the organisation. Government publications are a good source of environment information.\n- Search and Scanning\nIf particular type of information is required regarding the business environment, a proper research is conduct to come up with any conclusion.\nSpying is considered as unethical in business, even though organisation often use spying as a source to collect information.\n- Forecasting and Formal Studies\nThe information gathered by above three methods is used to predict business environment. Such forecast is basically done by corporate planners of consultants.\nSome of the popular techniques of environment analysis are described below\nIt is a systematic identification or analysis of Strengths (S) Weaknesses (W) Opportunities (O) and Threats (T) in the environment that exist internal or external to the organisation and the strategy that reflects the best match between them. It bases on the assumption that an effective strategy maximises a business\u2019s strengths and opportunities but at the same time, minimises its weaknesses and threats. SWOT is the cornerstone of business policy formulation; which determine the course of action to ensure the survival and growth of the firm. Economic Technological Business Socio-cultural International Political Natural\nUses of SWOTAnalysis\n\u2022 Corporate planning\n\u2022 Competitor evaluation\n\u2022 Business and product development\n\u2022 Set objectives\u2013defining what the organisation is intending to do.\n\u2022 Environmental scanning.\n\u2022 Internal appraisals of the organizations SWOT, this needs to include an assessment of the present situation as well as a portfolio of products\/services and an analysis of the product\/service life cycle.\n\u2022 Analysis of existing strategies, this should determine relevance from the results of an internal\/external appraisal.\n\u2022 Develop new\/revised strategies \u2013 revised analysis of strategic issues may mean the objectives need to change.\n\u2022 Preparation of operational, resource, projects plans for strategy implementation.\n\u2022 Monitoring results \u2013 mapping against plans, taking corrective action which may mean amending objectives\/strategies.\n- PETELS \/ PESTLE \/ PEST Analysis\nPESTEL stands for Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Environmental and Legal. Traditionally PESTEL analysis was known as the PEST (sometime rearranged as STEP) analysis. In modern time PESTLE came into being by splitting the social part of the PEST into environmental and economic factor into legal factor as these factors have a significant role in the strategic management these days. It is a strategic planning technique that provides a useful framework for analysing the environmental pressures on an organisation. To have upper hand on the competitors every company should do the PESTEL analysis frequently to make necessary changes in the goals and take appropriate decisions to be alive in the market.\n- Industry Analysis\nAn industry analysis is a business function completed by business owners and other individuals to assess the current business environment. This analysis helps businesses to understand various economic pieces of the market place and how these pieces may be used to gain a competitive advantage. Although, business owners may conduct an industry analysis according to their specific needs, a few basic standards exist for conducting this important business function.\n- Competitor\u2019s Analysis\nThe competitive structure of industries is a very important business environment. Identification of forces affecting the competitive dynamics of an industry will be very useful in formulating business strategies. According to Michael Porter\u2019s, \u201cThe state of competition in an industry depends on five basic competitive forces which provides a simple perspective for assessing and analysing the competitive strength and position of a business organisation,\u201d which are as\n1. Existing competitive rivalry between suppliers\n2. Threat of new market entrants\n3. Bargaining power of buyers\n4. Power of suppliers\n5. Threat of substitute products (including technology change)\nPorter\u2019s Five Forces Model\/ Five external industry forces affecting an organization.\nPorter\u2019s five forces model is an analysis tool that uses five industry forces to determine the intensity of competition in an industry and its profitability level.\nUnderstanding the tool\nFive forces model was created by M. Porter in 1979 to understand how five key competitive forces are affecting an industry. The five forces identified are:\nThese forces determine an industry structure and the level of competition in that industry. The stronger competitive forces in the industry are the less profitable it is. An industry with low barriers to enter, having few buyers and suppliers but many substitute products and competitors will be seen as very competitive and thus, not so attractive due to its low profitability.\nIt is every strategist\u2019s job to evaluate company\u2019s competitive position in the industry and to identify what strengths or weakness can be exploited to strengthen that position. The tool is very useful in formulating firm\u2019s strategy as it reveals how powerful each of the five key forces is in a particular industry.\n- Threat of new entrants.\nThis force determines how easy (or not) it is to enter a particular industry. If an industry is profitable and there are few barriers to enter, rivalry soon intensifies. When more organizations compete for the same market share, profits start to fall. It is essential for existing organizations to create high barriers to enter to deter new entrants. Threat of new entrants is high when:\n- Low amount of capital is required to enter a market\n- Existing companies can do little to retaliate;\n- Existing firms do not possess patents, trademarks or do not have established brand reputation;\n- There is no government regulation;\n- Customer switching costs are low (it doesn\u2019t cost a lot of money for a firm to switch to other industries);\n- There is low customer loyalty\n- Products are nearly identical;\n- Economies of scale can be easily achieved.\n- Bargaining power of suppliers.\nStrong bargaining power allows suppliers to sell higher priced or low quality raw materials to their buyers. This directly affects the buying firms\u2019 profits because it has to pay more for materials. Suppliers have strong bargaining power when:\n- There are few suppliers but many buyers;\n- Suppliers are large and threaten to forward integrate\n- Few substitute raw materials exist;\n- Suppliers hold scarce resources;\n- Cost of switching raw materials is especially high.\n- Bargaining power of buyers.\nBuyers have the power to demand lower price or higher product quality from industry producers when their bargaining power is strong. Lower price means lower revenues for the producer, while higher quality products usually raise production costs. Both scenarios result in lower profits for producers. Buyers exert strong bargaining power when:\n- Buying in large quantities or control many access points to the final customer;\n- Only few buyers exist\n- Switching costs to other supplier are low\n- They threaten to backward integrate;\n- There are many substitutes;\n- Buyers are price sensitive.\n- Threat of substitutes.\nThis force is especially threatening when buyers can easily find substitute products with attractive prices or better quality and when buyers can switch from one product or service to another with little cost. For example, to switch from coffee to tea doesn\u2019t cost anything, unlike switching from car to bicycle.\n- Rivalry among existing competitors.\nThis force is the major determinant on how competitive and profitable an industry is. In competitive industry, firms have to compete aggressively for a market share, which results in low profits. Rivalry among competitors is intense when:\n- There are many competitors;\n- Exit barriers are high;\n- Industry of growth is slow or negative;\n- Products are not differentiated and can be easily substituted;\n- Competitors are of equal size;\n- Low customer loyalty.\nAlthough, Porter originally introduced five forces affecting an industry, scholars have suggested including the sixth force: complements. Complements increase the demand of the primary product with which they are used, thus, increasing firm\u2019s and industry\u2019s profit potential. For example, iTunes was created to complement iPod and added value for both products. As a result, both iTunes and iPod sales increased, increasing Apple\u2019s profits.\nUsing the tool\nWe now understand that Porter\u2019s five forces framework is used to analyze industry\u2019s competitive forces and to shape organization\u2019s strategy according to the results of the analysis. But how to use this tool? We have identified the following steps:\n- Step 1. Gather the information on each of the five forces\n- Step 2. Analyze the results and display them on a diagram\n- Step 3. Formulate strategies based on the conclusions\nStep1. Gather the information on each of the five forces.\nWhat managers should do during this step is to gather information about their industry and to check it against each of the factors (such as \u201cnumber of competitors in the industry\u201d) influencing the force. We have already identified the most important factors in the table below.\nStep 2. Analyze the results and display them on a diagram.\nAfter gathering all the information, you should analyze it and determine how each force is affecting an industry. For example, if there are many companies of equal size operating in the slow growth industry, it means that rivalry between existing companies is strong. Remember that five forces affect different industries differently so don\u2019t use the same results of analysis for even similar industries!\nStep 3. Formulate strategies based on the conclusions.\nAt this stage, managers should formulate firm\u2019s strategies using the results of the analysis For example, if it is hard to achieve economies of scale in the market, the company should pursue cost leadership strategy. Product development strategy should be used if the current market growth is slow and the market is saturated.\nAlthough, Porter\u2019s five forces is a great tool to analyze industry\u2019s structure and use the results to formulate firm\u2019s strategy, it has its limitations and requires further analysis to be done, such as SWOT, PEST or Value Chain analysis.\n5. QUEST Analysis\nIt is a quick environmental scanning technique which is proposed by B Nanus.\nIt is a four step process\n1. Observe the major events and trends in the industry.\n2. Speculate on a wide range of important issue.\n3. Prepare a report summarising the major issues and their implications.\n4. Identify feasible strategic options to deal with the evolving environment.\n6. Change with Environments Changes\nAn organisation may use several techniques to change with its environments.\nThis technique is used to soften the impact of environment on the organisation. Stocking materials, preventive maintenance, employee training, building inventory are some of the examples of buffering. It involves allocating organisational resources according to a system of priorities. On the one hand, buffering absorbs environment fluctuations and on the other levelling is an attempts to reduce fluctuations in the environment. e.g., retail firms faced with seasonal fluctuations offer price cuts in order to spread sales more evenly throughout the year.\nUnder this method organisation tries to control events in the environment and reduce its dependence on them. It mean acquiring information about probable changes in the environment. An organisation may change itself, its operations and output.\nBenefits of Understanding the Environment\nEarly identification of opportunities helps an enterprise to be the first to exploit them instead of loosing them to competitors. Environmental understanding provide enough information regarding the need and expectation of the customer and helps business organisation to focus towards their customers. Keeping an eye on environment provide relevant information to the organisation in formulation of strategy.\nIt makes a firm aware of the impending threat or crises, so that the firm can take timely action to minimise the adverse effects. A business firm can improve its image by showing that it is sensitive to its environment and responsive to the aspiration of public.\nEnterprises that continuously monitoring their environment and adopt suitable business practices not only improve their present performance, but also succeed in the market for a longer period.\nBusiness leaders act as agents of change. They create a drive for change at the gross root level. In order to decide the direction and nature of change, the leaders need to understand the aspirations of people and other environmental forces through environment scanning.\nEnvironmental study helps us in getting updates regarding technological changes and helps in making action plans to cope with such changes.\nIn the process of transforming inputs into output, business organisations operate in a multifaceted environment which affects and is affected by their activities. This environment tends to be complex and volatile and comprises influences which are of both a general and an immediate kind and which operate at different spatial levels. Understanding this environment and its effects on business operations is of vital importance to the study and practice of business.\nSummary of Key Points\n- Business activity is essentially concerned with transforming inputs into outputs for consumption purposes.\n- All businesses operate within an external environment which shapes their operations and decisions.\n- This environment comprises influences which are both operational and general.\n- The operational environment of business is concerned with such factors as customers, suppliers, creditors and competitors.\n- The general environment focuses on what are known as the PESTLE factors.\n- In analysing a firm\u2019s external environment attention needs to be paid to the interaction between the different environmental variables, environmental complexity, volatility and change and to the spatial influences.\n- While all firms are affected by the environment in which they exist and operate, at times they help to shape that environment by their activities and behaviour.\nBaileys, An Example\nAim: to give an example of the way that a major company responds to its environment \u2013 and can even change it.\nIn the 1970s, Diageo noticed an opportunity in its Dublin operations to take advantage of a local surplus of milk \u2013 using this in an entirely new cream liqueur that they called Baileys. This proved so successful over the next 20 years that it used all the surplus milk around Dublin, and began to create a shortage. The operations of Diageo were so large that they changed the features of their environment \u2013 and particularly affecting the economics of local dairy farming. Their next stage was carefully planned, and consisted of steps to increase the efficiency of farmers, raising their productivity and lowering costs. Their impact on the environment went wider, ranging from social changes as agriculture became more attractive, to competitive forces as customers increased demand for different types of drinks.\nQuestions to be discussed?\n- Some people say that organisations do not succeed by fitting their strategy to opportunities in an existing environment, but by developing strengths to create entirely new opportunities. What does this mean?\nForecasting, planning and goals\nForecasting is a common statistical task in business, where it helps inform decisions about scheduling of production, transportation and personnel, and provides a guide to long-term strategic planning. However, business forecasting is often done poorly and is frequently confused with planning and goals. They are three different things.\nForecasting is about predicting the future as accurately as possible, given all the information available including historical data and knowledge of any future events that might impact the forecasts.\nGoals are what you would like to happen. Goals should be linked to forecasts and plans, but this does not always occur. Too often, goals are set without any plan for how to achieve them, and no forecasts for whether they are realistic.\nPlanning is a response to forecasts and goals. Planning involves determining the appropriate actions that are required to make your forecasts match your goals.\nForecasting should be an integral part of the decision-making activities of management, as it can play an important role in many areas of a company. Modern organizations require short-, medium- and long-term forecasts, depending on the specific application.\nShort-term forecasts are needed for scheduling of personnel, production and transportation. As part of the scheduling process, forecasts of demand are often also required.\nMedium-term forecasts are needed to determine future resource requirements in order to purchase raw materials, hire personnel, or buy machinery and equipment.\nLong-term forecasts are used in strategic planning. Such decisions must take account of market opportunities, environmental factors and internal resources.\nAn organization needs to develop a forecasting system involving several approaches to predicting uncertain events. Such forecasting systems require the development of expertise in identifying forecasting problems, applying a range of forecasting methods, selecting appropriate methods for each problem, and evaluating and refining forecasting methods over time. It is also important to have strong organizational support for the use of formal forecasting methods if they are to be used successfully.\nTwo Commonly used methods\nTypically, businesses use relatively simple forecasting methods that are often not based on statistical modelling. However, the use of statistical forecasting is growing and some of the most commonly used methods are listed below.\n- Time series methods\n\u2022 Naive forecasting: it is popular for stock price and stock index forecasting, and for other time series that measure the behaviour of a market that can be assumed to be efficient.\n\u2022 Simple exponential smoothing was developed in the 1950s (Brown 1959) and has been widely used ever since. This was an attractive feature of the method when computer storage was expensive. The method has proved remarkably robust to a wide range of time series, and is optimal for several processes including the ARIMA(0,1,1) process.\n\u2022 Holt\u2019s linear method (Holt 1957) is an extension of simple exponential forecasting that allows a locally linear trend to be extrapolated.\n\u2022 There is also a multiplicative version of the Holt-Winters method, and damped trend versions of both Holt\u2019s linear method and the Holt-Winters method. None of these methods are explicitly based on underlying time series models, and as a result the estimation of parameters and the computation of prediction intervals is often not done. However, all the above methods have recently been shown to be optimal for some state space models, and maximum likelihood estimation of parameters, statistical model selection and computation of prediction intervals is now becoming more widespread.\nOther time series models sometimes used in business forecasting include ARIMA models, GARCH models (especially in finance), structural models and neural networks.\n- Explanatory models for forecasting\nThe use of explanatory models in business forecasting does not have such a long history as the use of time series methods.\n\u2022 Linear regression modelling is now widely used where a variable to be forecast is modelled as linear combination of potential input variables:\nAn interesting application of regression model to forecasting is given by Byron & Ashenfelter (1995) who use a simple regression model to predict the quality of a Grange wine using simple weather variables. However, it is far more common for regression modelling to be used to explain historical variation than for it to be used for forecasting purposes.\n\u2022 In advertising, there is a well-developed culture of using distributed lag regression models\nData mining methods for business forecasting\nOutside of traditional statistical modelling, an enormous amount of forecasting is done using data mining methods. Most of these methods have no formal statistical model, prediction intervals are not computed, and there is limited model checking. But some of the data-mining methods have proven powerful predictors in some contexts, especially when there is a vast quantity of available data. Predictive methods include neural networks, support vector machines and regression trees. Many of the most best-known business predictive algorithms are based on data-mining methods including the prediction of Netflix ratings and recommended books on Amazon.com\nMarketing Intelligence System\nInformation and reliable data form the bedrock of any management decision. They also form the basis for all the diagnostic and prognostic efforts of managers. From a marketing stand point, problems can only be anticipated, identified, analysed and resolved or prevented if accurate and reliable, relevant information can be obtained promptly from both internal and external sources.\nThis overriding importance of marketing information is so obvious that every trained marketing manager or executive makes deliberate and sustained efforts to generate, analyze and use reliable marketing related information. The marketing environment is changing at an accelerating rate, so the need for real time market intelligence and information had never been more pressing. The shifts are dramatic, from local to national and to global marketing, from buyers needs to buy wants, from price to non- price competition. As companies expand their geographical market coverage, the managers need more information more quickly: as incomes improve buyer become more selective in their choices of goods and services. To predict buyer\u2019s responses to different features, styles and other attributes, seller must turn to marketing intelligence. As sellers increase their use of branding, product differentiation, advertising and sales promotion, they equally require information on the effectiveness of this marketing tools.\nA central problem for managers today is the management of change and complexity arising from the organization\u2019s interaction with the turbulent external marketing environment. However, it is imperative for managers today, to be profoundly sensitive to on-going changes in their environment. It is essential that marketing managers, marketing executive, marketing research officers and other employees of an organisation gain good understanding of how the marketing environment is changing. An alertness and sensitivity to the environment is very essential ingredient of business success, survival and longevity, because of the firm\u2019s dependence on it for resources inputs and services outputs. Successful companies take an outside-inside view of their business. They recognize that marketing environment is constantly presenting new opportunities and threats, which can only be detected, collected, analysed and utilized through the use of marketing intelligence and likewise an organisation should understand the importance of continuously monitoring and adapting to that environment. Many organisations fail to see change as opportunity. They ignore or resist changes until is too late. Their strategies, structures, systems and organizational cultures grow increasingly obsolete and dysfunctional.\nThe need for marketing information as regards the marketing environment of an organization cannot be over emphasized that is why this research work is highly imperative to today\u2019s decision making, the survival, the success and sustainability of an organisation. Moreover, a better understanding marketing intelligence requires the understanding of concept marketing information system. (This is analysed under the literature review). However, marketing information systems, marketing intelligence systems and marketing research systems are used to gather and analyse data for various parts of marketing plan. These systems can help marketers examine changes and trends to markets, competition, consumer needs, product usage and distribution channels, among other areas. They can turn up evidence of importance opportunities and threats that must be addressed. In carrying out marketing intelligence a manager or marketers needs to scan its environment for useful relevant and up-to-date information about all marketing activities in terms of opportunities and threats in this regard in this section of background of the study I tried in analyzing what environmental scanning is all about while in the later chapters , I will discuss more fully on the issue of marketing intelligence and marketing information system.\nThe term environment scanning is often used inter- changeably with others such as environment analysis, competitive intelligence gathering and strategic marketing information. In this respect, it could be regarded as marketing intelligence though there is difference however; they both serve the same major function in the marketing environment. Environmental scanning is a process by which marketing managers and executives probe and monitor the business environment to determine the opportunities for and threats to the organisation. This is also a means through which managers perceive and events in the marketing environment. The effectiveness of planning in any organisation is found to be directly related to the capacity of management for environment scanning.\nAs an organisation increases in size and complexity the need for marketing intelligence also increases simultaneously. When addressing the issue of marketing intelligence certain questions needed to be addressed:\n1. What environment do firms need to scan or probe?\n2. What information in the environment does the firm need to gather?\n3. What are those necessary, relevant and up-to-date consumers need and want (in terms of information do we need to have as an organisation?\n4. Of what relevance is this information?\n5. What techniques are available to marketing executives or managers for scanning?\nThe above questions coupled with the following questions, make the marketing intelligence indispensable in the modern market.\na. What kinds of people buy our product?\nb. What do they value?\nc. What do the buy?\nd. What kind of new product would they like to see in the market?\ne. Why the sudden change in consumers buying patterns?\nf. What if our competitors are attracting more consumers and why?\ng. What would be the effect of changes in the price of our product?\nThese and other related questions are the key to informed marketing decision making. As we already know that a prerequisite for the adoption of a marketing orientation is knowledge about consumers and other aspect of the marketing environment that affect organisations operation\u2019s managers obtain information by informal and formal means. Casual discussion with customers at exhibitions or through sales calls can provide valuable informal information about their requirement, competitors activities and future happening in the industry. Some companies particularly those who have few customers, rely on these types of interaction gathering to keep abreast of market changes.\nAs the customer base grows, such method may be inadequate to provide the necessary indepth marketing knowledge to compete effectively. A more formal approach is needed to supply information systematically to mangers. The research work focus on this formal method of information provision. Marketing intelligence is important since the quality of the marketing information affect the effectiveness of decision making Irrespective of the sector of the economy or market an organisation operates, there is always a rivalry among the various player (the organisations) in this sector, and each organisation need to device means of existing, sustaining and becoming a mega force to be reckoned with in this sector. Many organisations believe in the use of price as a strategic tool in their various competitive market environment, however, one thing that must be understood is that whether or not an organisation engages in price or non \u2013 price competitions to have competitive advantage over others.\nIt is still precipitated to good use of marketing intelligence, the monitoring of marketing activities for vital and essential information. Many factors have increased the need for more and better information as companies becomes national and international in scope, they need more information on larger, more distant markets as income increase and buyers becomes more selective organisation need better information about how buyers respond to their different products and appeals. As organisation uses more competition, they need information on the effectiveness of their marketing strategic tools. In today\u2019s rapidly changing environment managers need up-to-date information to make timely decision.\n- An analysis of viability of idea from logical beginning to logical end\n- Begin or not: is it viable business venture\n- Provide a thorough examination of all issues and assessment of probability of business success\n- Give focus to the project and outline alternatives\n- Narrow business alternatives\n- Surface new opportunities through the investigative process\n- Identify reasons NOT to proceed\n- Enhance the probability of success by addressing and mitigating factors early on that could affect the project\n- Provide quality information for decision making\n- Help to increase investment in the company\n- Provide documentation that the business venture was thoroughly investigated\n- Help in securing funding from lending institutions and other monetary sources\nA feasibility study of an idea is conducted at three levels\n- Operational Feasibility\n- \u201cWill it work?\u201d\n- Technical Feasibility\n- \u201cCan it be built?\u201d\n- Economic Feasibility\n- \u201cWill it make economic sense if it works and is built?\u201d\n- \u201cWill it generate PROFITS?\u201d\nEstimating Total Capital Requirements\n- Assess the \u201cseed capital\u201d needs of the business project and how these needs will be met\n- Estimate capital requirements for facilities, equipment and inventories\n- Replacement capital requirements and timing for facilities and equipment\n- Estimate working capital needs\n- Estimate start-up capital needs until revenues are realized at full capacity\n- Estimate contingency capital needs (constructions delays, technology malfunction, market access delays, etc.)\n- Estimate other capital needs\nEstimate Equity and Credit Needs\n- Identify alternative equity sources and capital availability\n- Producers, Local Investors, Angel Investors, Venture Capitalists\n- Identify and assess alternative credit sources\n- Banks, Government (direct loans or loan guarantees), Grants, Local and State Economic Development Incentives\n- Assess expected financing needs and alternative sources\n- Interest Rates, Terms, Conditions, Covenants, Liens, Etc.\n- Debt to Equity Levels\nCost benefit Analysis\n- Estimate Expected Costs and Revenue\n- Estimate the Profit Margin and Expected Net Profit\n- Estimate the sales or usage needed to break-even\n- Estimate the returns under various production, price and sales levels to create a \u201csensitivity analysis\u201d\n- Assess the reliability of the underlying assumptions of the financial analysis\n- Benchmark against industry averages and\/or competitors\n- Identify limitations or constraints of the economic analysis\n- Project expected cash flow during the start-up period\n- Project income statement, balance sheet when reaching full operation","metadata":{"date":1709220849000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947474843.87\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240229134901-20240229164901-00598.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9380453825,"token_count":8600,"url":"https:\/\/harit.com.np\/business-environment-analysis\/"},"score":3,"id":"336"}

This transformative approach enables the creation of concise, readable, and efficient code. With operations like map, filter, and reduce, Java Streams with Java Stream collect allow developers to articulate complex data manipulations with minimal boilerplate, fostering a more declarative and streamlined programming style. The introduction of lazy evaluation and parallel processing capabilities further enhances performance, making Java Streams an indispensable tool for elegant and effective data processing in contemporary Java applications and java stream map.\nSignificance of Java Streams\nStreams allow developers to express complex data manipulations and transformations using a declarative style. This is a departure from traditional imperative programming, where developers specify the step-by-step instructions for data processing.\nOne of the key features of Java Streams is lazy evaluation. Operations on a stream are only executed when a terminal operation is invoked. This lazy approach enhances performance by executing only the necessary operations, making it efficient for large datasets.\nJava Streams provide a consistent and cohesive API for working with different types of data sources, including collections, arrays, and I\/O channels. This uniformity simplifies the learning curve and promotes code reuse.\nJava Streams enhance error handling by introducing the Optional class. This helps avoid null pointer exceptions and encourages developers to handle exceptional cases in a more elegant and structured manner.\nUnderstanding Java Streams\nStreams facilitate a declarative style of programming, allowing developers to express what operations they want to perform on a collection rather than specifying how to perform them with java stream map. This leads to more concise and readable code. The primary purpose of Java Streams is to provide a more expressive and efficient way to perform operations on collections, such as lists, arrays, or sets along with java stream filter and map.\nContrast Streams with Traditional Collection Manipulation:\nTraditional collection manipulation in Java involves using loops (for, while) and imperative code along with java stream map to iterate through elements, apply transformations, and filter data. This approach often results in verbose and error-prone code.\nJava Streams offer a higher-level abstraction, hiding iteration details and promoting a functional programming style. Here are key contrasts:\nImperative vs. Declarative:\nTraditional manipulation is imperative, where developers explicitly state how to achieve a result using loops and conditions.\nStreams enable developers to declare desired operations, while the stream API manages iteration and processing details effectively.\nMutability vs. Immutability:\nTraditional approaches may involve modifying the original collection, leading to potential side effects.\nStreams operate on an immutable data model, producing new streams with transformed data instead of modifying the original collection. This encourages safer and more predictable code.\nTraditional approaches require developers to explicitly implement parallel processing for improved performance.\nStreams seamlessly support parallel processing, allowing developers to parallelize operations without intricate threading logic.\nExample \u2013 Traditional approach vs. Java Streams:\n\/\/ Traditional approach using loops\n\/\/ Java Streams approach\nReadability and Conciseness:\nTraditional code may be verbose, with multiple lines needed to express simple transformations or filters.\nStreams enable more concise and expressive code, reducing the amount of boilerplate typically associated with collection manipulation.\nStream Operations Overview\nJava Streams categorize operations into two main types: intermediate operations and terminal operations.\nIntermediate Operations: Intermediate operations are operations that transform a stream into another stream. These operations are lazy, creating a pipeline that executes when a terminal operation is invoked, rather than immediately.\nIntermediate operations allow for the transformation, filtration, and modification of data in the stream without producing a final result. They are often used to prepare the data for the final computation with java stream filter. Examples: map, filter, flatMap, distinct, sorted, peek, etc.\nTerminal Operations: Terminal operations are operations that produce a final result or a side effect. Invoking a terminal operation executes the entire stream pipeline, preventing further operations on that stream.\nTerminal operations trigger the computation of the stream and produce a result or perform an action. They are the endpoint of the stream pipeline. Examples: forEach, collect, reduce, count, anyMatch, allMatch, noneMatch, etc.\nCommon Stream Operations\nIntermediate Operation:map is used to transform each element in the stream according to the provided function.\nOverview of Stream Features Introduced Beyond Java 8\nJava Streams, introduced in Java 8, have evolved in subsequent Java releases, bringing additional features and enhancements to make stream processing even more versatile and efficient. Here\u2019s a brief overview of some updates introduced in Java versions beyond 8:\ntakeWhile and dropWhile: Introduces takeWhile and dropWhile methods, allowing for more flexible and precise stream processing by taking or dropping elements based on a specified condition.\niterate method enhancements: The iterate method now supports a predicate to limit the stream\u2019s size, providing a more controlled and efficient way to generate infinite streams.\nCollector enhancements: Java 10 introduces the Collectors.toUnmodifiableList(), Collectors.toUnmodifiableSet(), and Collectors.toUnmodifiableMap() methods, enabling the creation of unmodifiable collections directly during stream processing.\nCollectors.teeing: Introduces the Collectors.teeing method, allowing the creation of more complex collectors by combining the results of two collectors. This facilitates the aggregation of multiple values in a single pass.\ntoList() method: Java 16 introduces a convenient toList() method on the Stream interface, making it easier to collect stream elements into an unmodifiable list.\nmapMulti: The mapMulti method is introduced, providing a concise way to transform each element in a stream into multiple elements or none at all, based on a specified consumer.\nStream.toList() convenience method: Java 17 features introduces the toList() method directly on the Stream interface, providing a more streamlined way to collect stream elements into a list.\nEnhancements for Stream.concat: Improvements have been made to the Stream.concat method, making it more efficient and performant when concatenating multiple streams with Java 17 features.\nIn recapitulating the power and versatility of Java Streams, it\u2019s evident that these constructs have revolutionized the way we handle collections in Java. Introduced in Java 8, java stream collect bring functional programming concepts to the forefront, enabling developers to write cleaner, more expressive, and efficient code along with java stream filter. Streams offer a declarative approach to data manipulation, allowing developers to focus on operations rather than implementation intricacies. The pipeline structure, comprised of intermediate and terminal operations, facilitates a modular and organized flow, leading to code that is both concise and readable as well in Java 17 features.\nIn conclusion, the adoption of Java Streams is not merely an embrace of a feature; it\u2019s an adoption of a more elegant and efficient coding philosophy. As developers venture into the realm of java stream collect, they unlock a powerful set of tools that not only simplify data manipulation but also contribute to the creation of code that is not only functional but also a joy to read and maintain. Embracing development with java stream filter is not just a trend; it\u2019s a commitment to writing code that stands the test of time in Java 17 features.\nGet a Fast Estimate on Your Software Development Project\nWe are committed to delivering high-quality IT solutions tailored to meet the unique needs of our clients.

{"text":"Forty years ago, physicists Arno A. Penzias and Robert W. Wilson received the Nobel Prize in physics for discovering cosmic microwave background radiation, the most important proof of the Big Bang theory.\nThe story began in 1963, when Penzias and Wilson were using the antenna in Holmdel, New Jersey, to study the Milky Way. Early on, the two astrophysicists detected a uniform \u201cparasitic noise\u201d coming from all the regions of the sky. Thinking their equipment was malfunctioning, they checked every component of the antenna, going so far as to remove pigeon droppings that had found their way in. Despite their efforts, the \u201cparasitic noise\u201d remained.\nIt was then that Penzias and Wilson contacted their colleagues at Princeton University to get their opinion on this mysterious background noise. The astrophysicist John Peebles quickly remarked that our experimenters had detected the oldest picture of the Universe: cosmic microwave background radiation.\nWhere did cosmic background radiation come from?\nThe Big Bang happened 13.8 billion years ago, when the Universe, infinitely dense and hot, began to expand in a dizzying way.\nIn the Universe\u2019s first moments, the density of matter was so great that the slightest photon of light was immediately reabsorbed. It is believed that the Universe at the time was opaque, because no photon from that period is observable. After 380,000 years, expansion had sufficiently dilated the Universe for photons to begin to move about freely, creating the cosmic microwave background radiation that can be observed today.\nA discovery of importance\nAs early as the 1940s, theoreticians had predicted that it would be possible to observe that light in the microwave range. After a number of unsuccessful efforts, Penzias and Wilson would be the first to accomplish the feat of detecting cosmic microwave background radiation.\nIn July 1965 they published an article in the specialist publication Astrophysical Journal to announce their discovery. Peebles and his Princeton colleagues wrote a second article explaining the significance of that discovery.\nAs a consequence of the observation of cosmic microwave background radiation, the Big Bang theory, which was still highly controversial, came to be accepted by the astronomical community, and established itself as the best theory for explaining the birth and evolution of the Universe.","metadata":{"date":1709491730000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947476397.24\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240303174631-20240303204631-00897.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9616057873,"token_count":471,"url":"https:\/\/espacepourlavie.ca\/blogue\/en\/first-picture-universe"},"score":4,"id":"341"}

{"text":"For those who traveled engaged in culinary pursuits,\nthe Turkish cuisine is a very curious one.\nThe variety of dishes that make the cuisine, the\nways they are all come together in feast-like meals, and the\nevident intricacy of each craft offer enough material for lifelong\nstudy and enjoyment.\nOne can only conclude that the evolution\nof the glorious cuisine was not an accident. Similar to other grand\ncuisine's of the world, it is a result of a combination of three\nkey elements. A nurturing environment is irreplaceable.\nTurkey is known for an abundance and diversity of foodstuff due to\nits flora, fauna and regional differentiation. And the legacy of an\nimperial kitchen is inescapable. Hundreds of cooks specializing in different\ntypes of dishes, all eager to please the royal palate, no doubt had\ntheir influence in perfecting the cuisine we know today.\nThe palace kitchen supported by a complex social organization, a vibrant urban life, specialization of labor, trade and total control of the spice road, reflected the culmination of wealth and the flourishing of culture in the capital of the mighty Empire.\nAnd the influence of the longevity of social organizations should not be taken lightly either.\nThe Turkish state of Anatolia is a millennium old and so, naturally is the cuisine.\nTime is of the essence: \"The religion of the king, in time becomes that of the people\",which also holds for the king's food. Thus the reign of the Ottoman dynasty during 600 years, and a seamless cultural transition into the present day of modern Turkey, let to the evolution of a grand cuisine through differentiation, refinement and perfection of dishes, as well as their sequence and combination of meals.\nThe Turkish cuisine has an extra privilege of being at the crossroad of the Far-east and the Mediterranean, which mirrors along and complex history of Turkish migration from the steppes of central Asia (where they mingled with the Chinese) to Europe ( where they exerted influence all the way to Vienna).","metadata":{"date":1709335182000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947475711.57\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240301225031-20240302015031-00598.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9479908347,"token_count":413,"url":"https:\/\/business-with-turkey.com\/tourist-guide\/cuisine.shtml"},"score":3,"id":"346"}
{"text":"October 6 is California Clean Air Day \u2013 an annual day of action to improve air quality across California. Small actions on your part can help make a big difference.\nOne of the key elements of the event is the Clean Air Pledge. By taking it, individuals and organizations commit to doing their part to help clean the air on October 6, through actions both big and small.\nIf you take the Clean Air Pledge as an individual or household, you select actions to take from three main categories: Switching Things Out, Planting Something, and Reducing Vehicle Use. For example, you might choose to change your home air filter, plant a tree, or take public transit to work instead of driving. How many action items you choose is completely up to you.\nHere\u2019s a sample of actions you can choose from:\nThere\u2019s also a Clean Air Pledge for Kids (with more actions to choose from on the website):\nOrganizations and businesses can take the pledge, choosing which business practices to modify and educational efforts to undertake for Clean Air Day. Not only will participating organizations be listed on the Clean Air Day website, but employers can get a count of how many employees have decided to take the Clean Air Pledge as individuals.\nThe California Clean Air Day website has a list of events, some leading up to October 6 and some on Clean Air Day. Here are some events happening locally:\n- Richmond Annual Community Bike Ride \u2013 October 6th at 11:30am\n- Free rides on WestCAT, San Francisco Bay Ferry, Tri Delta Transit, and Wheels \u2013 October 6 (all day)\nOther Ways to Get Involved\nIf you\u2019re looking for other ways to get involved in California Clean Air Day, here are some ideas:\n- Businesses can provide support as a sponsor and plan to have employees volunteer at one of the Clean Air Day events around the state.\n- Local organizations can promote Clean Air Day and help their community have higher participation.\n- You can plan your own California Clean Air Day event.\nEvery Little Bit Helps\nNo matter how small you might think an action is, like not idling your engine or adding a plant to your office, it all adds up. Contributing to better air quality is easier than you might think. So consider taking the Clean Air Pledge an committing to at least one action on October 6 and be an active part of California Clean Air Day.","metadata":{"date":1708742693000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947474482.98\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240224012912-20240224042912-00598.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9481621385,"token_count":494,"url":"https:\/\/511contracosta.org\/tag\/clean-air-day\/"},"score":2,"id":"347"}

And please ignore the fact that back in 2005, Senator Hillary Clinton (D-NY) sponsored a bill to make burning an American flag a criminal offense. The important difference is that she didn\u2019t tweet about it. That would be insane, because Twitter didn\u2019t even exist yet.\nMaybe you doubt Keith\u2019s mental-health bona fides, Dear Reader.

Could be.\nOr, another possibility \u2014 and I realize this is way out there, folks, but just bear with me a sec \u2014 another possibility is that Donald Trump just says whatever comes off the top of his head at any given moment, and it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean anything.\nDoes he really look like a guy with a plan?\n\u2014 Katherine Faulders (@KFaulders) November 29, 2016\nNow, will it be good for America to have a president who says pretty much any dumb thing he feels like saying, whenever he sees something on TV that he doesn\u2019t like?

{"text":"The figure ground relationship in a painting is very crucial and important. Though you might be wondering what is a figure ground relationship?\nIn art and design, figure ground relationship is the relationship between an object or figure and its background. It is a way to separate or meld together objects with its background.\nThe background part of a painting is just as important as the main subject. All too often we think of the background as an afterthought. The way in which we relate the background and foreground areas to the main subject matter can make or break the painting.\nWhen done correctly, figure ground relationships can create an immense amount of depth and interest in a painting.\nHow to create the figure ground relationship (video) tutorial\nThe video directly below, will take you through the process of a still life painting of an orange. Showing you how to make a good figure ground relationship throughout the entire process of your painting!\nAssess your subject\u2019s surroundings\nIn order to create good figure ground relationships in a painting. It is important to pay attention to where there is contrast or similarity between the figure and its background. You want to make the subject matter feel like it is connected and a part of the background area. It is important to think about the subject and background\/ foreground as a whole.\nColor is a HUGE consideration when it comes to creating a good figure ground relationship. Compare and contrast your subject with the background at all times. It helps to paint the background at the same time as your main subject so that you develop them both together. You can get very detailed examples of this in my figure ground relationship video tutorial.\nColor is bouncing off of your main subject as well as the background and foreground areas. For example, in this orange still life painting tutorial we see how the color of the orange is reflecting onto the foreground area. All colors in a painting are relating to one another in some way. It is very important to be sensitive to and paint the areas where you notice color reflecting on certain areas.\nEdges and Value\nValue is the most important aspect of creating a good figure ground relationship in your painting. It allows you to make your subject matter stand out from or blend into the background. It is best to start with strong values right at the beginning of your painting.\nExamples of good figure ground relationships\nIn figure ground relationships, the figure is often the focal point and main subject of the painting or artwork. The figure will be more detailed, visible, and stand out to viewers compared to the background area. However, there are areas of the main subject that will blend in with the background.\nFor example, in this portrait below by William Merrit Chase we see areas of her hair that are very similar in value and color to the background. Those particular areas blend in with the background. Other areas stand out such as the contour of her neck and hairline on the left side.\nWe also see the woman\u2019s black shawl (from the painting above) blend into the background as the two colors are very similar in value. The figure feels like it is a natural part of the background and fits in because of the areas that blend in with the background and also stand out from the background. Every time you paint a main subject and background area you want to ask yourself what areas of the main subject blend in and which stand out against the background.\nFigure Ground Relationships in multi subject painting\nFigure ground relationship is just as relevant with a multi subject paintings as well. In this still life painting below by Chardin we can see how multiple subjects in the painting have a very good figure ground relationship.\nWe see how certain areas stand out from the background while other areas blend into the background. Therefore, it feels like the subjects belong where they are situated in the painting.\nFigure ground relationship tips for your own painting\nThe best way to learn how to directly apply a good figure ground relationship to your own painting is by painting along with my figure ground video tutorial.\nAlways compare colors\nThink in terms of \u2018spots of color\u2019 while you paint and continually compare and contrast colors with one another. This will heighten your sensitivity to color and help you to create a good figure ground relationship in your painting.\nTake a step back\nIt helps to get a different perspective on your painting to see if a good figure ground relationship is happening in your work. Take a step back to look at your painting as a whole \u2013 this will help you to see if your subject matter feels like it\u2019s part of the background and foreground.\nAlso, seeing your painting on a smaller format, as a photo on your phone for example, can also be very helpful.\nAs you paint, keep all of the things discussed in this article and figure ground relationship video tutorial in mind. The more you implement them the more they will become natural to your painting process. With practice your paintings will start to have a strong figure ground relationship.","metadata":{"date":1708828021000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947474573.20\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240225003942-20240225033942-00299.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9590468407,"token_count":1011,"url":"https:\/\/artstudiolife.com\/figure-ground-relationship\/"},"score":4,"id":"351"}
{"text":"What Type of Brush Is Right For You?\nEvery day we brush our teeth out of habit, or at least we should. We do this without thinking if our brushing habits are actually benefiting our teeth and gums. If you have ever wondered if your electric or manual toothbrush is doing its job, you aren\u2019t the only one. There are many things you might not know about your cleaning tool. Here are a list of manual and electric toothbrush benefits and disadvantages for you to consider.\nEven if you have a fancy toothbrush you use twice a day, we have all had to pick a manual toothbrush every once in a while. Most people are satisfied with this method and it has been used for centuries as is. They are one of the most useful inventions which Americans definitely take for granted. Even with this great invention, this product still has pros and cons which can influence which one you want to buy.\nBenefits of a Manual Toothbrush\nThere are many benefits of a manual toothbrush. Whether you think about it or not, your dental hygiene would be different without your toothbrush. Some of the main advantages are:\n- Price! Yes, you can find these products basically anywhere and for cheap\n- Different variations (i.e, color, size, bristles)\n- Transportable. Anywhere you go, a manual toothbrush is easy to pack.\n- No money wasted on batteries\n- Easily replaceable\nDisadvantages of a Manual Toothbrush\nIt might be hard to believe, but even manual toothbrushes have downsides to them. Although you know it\u2019s a trustworthy tool to always have in your toiletries, they can sometimes let you down. Some of the major disadvantages are:\n- No timers\n- No extra help (you need good brushing techniques)\n- Difficult to use for children and the disabled\n- Brushing too rough for your gums and teeth\nIf you want better dental health and don\u2019t believe you are great at brushing your teeth, an electric toothbrush might be the perfect fit for you. There are many reasons why someone might care for an electric toothbrush over a manual one. For one, the feeling of a clean smile all day has its perks. However, like a manual toothbrush, there are many electric toothbrush benefits and disadvantages.\nBenefits of an Electric Toothbrush\nAs one might assume, electric toothbrushes definitely have some unique and positive features attributed to it. Some of the benefits you might notice are:\n- Great for children and the disabled\n- More effective for removing plaque (if used correctly)\n- Great for cleaning teeth with braces\n- Can create enthusiasm for brushing your teeth\nDisadvantages for an Electric Toothbrush\nAlthough electric toothbrushes have their advantages, there are some downsides you have to consider.\n- Require replacing and changing of toothbrush heads\n- Susceptible to damage\nElectric or Manual?\nDepending on what you want with your toothbrush, you have a plethora of brushes to choose from. You\u2019ll want to remember to avoid hard bristles unless otherwise specified by your dentist. This is because hard bristles are hard on your gums and can irritate them. If you are still unsure what kind of brush would be best for your teeth, consult your dentist.\nWhy Jon A. Kulesa?\nIf you are looking for a dentist in Reno NV, Jon A. Kulesa is one of the best dentists in town. He will be able to help you with all your dental needs whether it is for cosmetic dentistry, dental cleanings, or oral hygiene.

{"text":"The agreement saw member labels including Sony, Universal, and Warner tracking allegedly-infringing Eircom subscribers online and Eircom forwarding infringement notices. Those caught three times would be eligible for disconnection from the Internet.\nUnder an agreement to give Eircom a level playing field, the labels targeted another ISP, UPC (later taken over by Virgin), with a demand to implement the same scheme. UPC dug in its heels and the case dragged on through the legal system.\nIn 2015, the High Court ruled in favor of the labels, rejecting complaints from UPC that it\u2019s not an ISP\u2019s job to police its subscribers\u2019 activities online.\nNow, more than three years later, the labels are back again with a renewed effort to have the graduated response scheme introduced more widely in Ireland. This time around, Sony, Warner and Universal are targeting Sky Ireland.\nAccording to the Irish Times, Sky has told the labels it will comply with their demands but has asked that they obtain a court order first.\nSky, which is already collaborating with the Premier League to block infringing streams, said that it was \u201cactively working\u201d with the industry to deal with online piracy.\n\u201cIt\u2019s therefore important that companies like ours do what they can, alongside the Government and the rest of the media and technology industries, to help protect copyright,\u201d Sky said.\n\u201cCopyright holders who believe broadband users have unlawfully shared content online have the option of taking their cases to court. If the order is granted, the service provider must comply and Sky would, of course, comply with any such order.\u201d\nAsking for a court order to be produced is standard form in such cases but given Sky\u2019s track record in such matters, it probably won\u2019t be putting up much of a fight. The issue of costs is likely to be a matter for dispute but putting the regime in place is unlikely to be a sticking point.\nIn response, the labels (under the Irish Recorded Music Association umbrella) initiated a claim in the High Court this week, with supporting papers filed by IRMA chief Willie Kavanagh.\nIT reports that IRMA is also in talks with Vodafone Ireland to implement the same anti-piracy scheme but the ISP has \u201craised technical concerns and sought more time.\u201d In any event, Vodafone is extremely unlikely to begin disconnecting customers without a legal basis so a court order will be required in this case too.","metadata":{"date":1708990705000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947474669.36\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240226225941-20240227015941-00699.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9545665383,"token_count":516,"url":"https:\/\/torrentfreak.com\/sony-universal-and-warner-ask-sky-to-disconnect-pirate-subscribers-180726\/"},"score":2,"id":"354"}

{"text":"Glucose in the blood is necessary for the proper functioning of our body. Both men and women need it. Its entry into brain neurons and red blood cells is important.\nGlucose is consumed in the body by bypassing the insulin pathway for:\n- protection of red blood cells and neurons from reactive oxygen species (ROS);\n- maintenance of iron in the erythrocyte in the form required for metabolism;\n- conservation of energy exchange;\n- ATP production for neurons;\n- synthesis of biologically active substances (neurotransmitters).\nGlucose transport to other cells is mediated by the pancreatic hormone insulin. Its deficiency in diabetes mellitus causes a lack of glucose in the cells and its excess in the blood.\nThe cells of the adrenal glands and gonads are involved in the synthesis of steroid hormones. For these purposes, they use glucose.\nThe liver synthesizes fatty acids, cholesterol and activates vitamin D in the human body. It performs all these functions thanks to glycolysis.\nDuring hunger and muscle work, glycogen synthesis processes are activated.\nWhat is a normal blood sugar level?\nGlycemia is the level of sugar in the blood. Normal values of this indicator are ensured by the balance of the processes of transport, use, creation and entry of glucose into the blood. The state of balance is maintained by hormones. Among them are:\n- hypoglycemic (insulin);\n- hyperglycemic (glucocorticosteroids, adrenaline, norepinephrine, glucagon).\nBlood glucose standards range from 3. 3 to 5. 5 mmol\/l; according to some sources, the reference limit has been moved to 6. 6. Values calculated for venous blood are slightly higher than for capillary indicators.\nHow does low blood sugar manifest itself?\nThe reason for this condition is the increased need of cells for glucose, due to which the processes of ATP production are disturbed.\nCauses of these disorders include:\n- hyperproduction of insulin in tumors (insulinoma);\n- wrongly administered dose of insulin for diabetes mellitus;\n- adrenal insufficiency caused by a lack of hyperglycemic hormones;\n- disruption of the flow of sugar from the intestine;\n- liver pathologies;\n- hereditary diseases that result in reduced glucose production;\n- alcohol addiction;\n- lack of vitamins (biotin) involved in glucose metabolism;\n- disorders of the central nervous system.\nA decrease in the level of glucose coming from the intestine can be associated with absorption pathology (for example, enteritis) and nutritional starvation caused by the lack of this element. This condition is called nutritional hypoglycemia.\nA low level of glucose in the blood leads to a nutritional deficit of red blood cells and brain neurons, which is characterized by the following symptoms:\n- pale skin;\n- rapid breathing and heartbeat;\n- sweating, chills;\nIn such situations, help must be provided immediately. The level of glucose in the blood increases with the help of sweets or an injection of medicine. Lack of help can lead to coma and death.\nHow does high blood sugar manifest itself?\nHyperglycemia is considered an increase in blood sugar of more than 5. 5 mmol\/l. This process is a consequence of reduced cell demand and increased glucose production. The reasons are:\n- lack of insulin in diabetes mellitus, pancreatic necrosis;\n- hyperproduction of hormones in acromegaly - somatotropic, thyrotoxicosis - iodothyronine, Itsenko-Cushing's disease - glucocorticosteroids;\n- kidney failure and impaired filtration;\n- overeating and excess sugar;\n- exercise stress;\n- stroke, brain tumor.\nThe most serious consequence of hyperglycemia is the development of hyperosmolar coma, caused by an excessive level of glucose in the blood, which attracts too much fluid into the blood vessels. This type of coma is typical for people with diabetes mellitus complicated by kidney failure. Normally, healthy kidneys prevent blood sugar from rising above 9 mmol\/L, reducing reabsorption and causing glycosuria.\nIn moderate hyperglycemia, the processes of pathological protein glycosylation and sorbitol formation are triggered. This compound promotes the accumulation of fluid in the tissues and disrupts the functioning of cells. Pathological glycosylation disrupts the work of antibodies and causes hypoxia. By changing the antigenic properties of proteins, it can lead to the emergence of autoimmune diseases.\nThe main clinical symptoms associated with high blood sugar are:\n- visual impairment;\n- nervous sensitivity disorder;\n- formation of kidney failure;\n- trophic disorders in the tissues of the lower extremities;\n- frequent urination;\n- general weakness;\n- strong thirst;\n- slow regeneration of cuts and wounds.\nMost of these signs characterize diabetes mellitus, a disease of endocrine etiology that is associated with impaired glucose absorption due to a lack of the hormone insulin.\nFactors that predispose to the development of this pathology include:\n- genetic predisposition;\n- excess weight;\n- taking inducer drugs.\nIf you recognize several of the listed clinical signs and risk factors, you should schedule an appointment with an endocrinologist.\nLaboratory tests: norms, blood sugar level in men and women\nMany methods and tests are used in the laboratory diagnosis of pathologies associated with disturbed sugar metabolism. This includes:\n- glucose tolerance test;\n- glycated hemoglobin;\n- determination of fasting blood sugar level;\n- general urinalysis;\n- blood chemistry.\nIn case of an unclear diagnosis, a tolerance test is carried out. If diabetes mellitus is established, this test is not recommended. For the test, blood is taken on an empty stomach, and then the level is assessed after drinking a solution with sugar. Based on the obtained data, a sugar curve is formed, the levels of which return to normal within 2-3 hours. A reading above 11 mmol\/l indicates possible deviations.\nGlycated hemoglobin is used to monitor the dynamics of hyperglycemia in people with diabetes mellitus, to identify latent forms and to diagnose gestational diabetes mellitus in pregnant women. The norm is up to 6% of the total amount of hemoglobin.\nThe presence of sugar in the general urine test is directly influenced by the concentration of glucose in the blood. Its reabsorption is normally 1. 7 mmol per minute. The blood sugar level above which it appears in the urine is called the renal threshold. Its value is 8. 8 \u2013 9. 9 mmol\/l. The appearance of sugar in the urine may indicate diabetes mellitus, however, it is not the only reason. Glucosuria develops in some cases:\n- in pregnant women with reduced reabsorption;\n- with congenital or acquired anomaly of the proximal tubules of the kidney.\nA level of up to 0. 8 mmol\/l is considered normal.\nWhat medications can affect test results?\nMedicines taken continuously can skew the results up or down.\n- glucocorticosteroid hormones (hydrocortisone, prednisolone, budesonide, etc. );\n- drugs for the treatment of psychiatric diseases;\n- oral contraceptives prescribed for women;\n- antihypertensive drugs;\n- syrup-based cough suppressants.\nAspirin, aloe juice and quinine artificially lower blood sugar values.\nThese studies also affect female sex hormones, so taking tests before the start of menstruation should be postponed until it ends.\nThus, glucose has a huge impact on the performance of the whole body. To prevent the disease, especially in people with a hereditary predisposition to diabetes, it is necessary to determine the concentration of sugar in the blood at least once a year, or as part of a medical examination.","metadata":{"date":1708752931000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947474523.8\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240224044749-20240224074749-00698.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.8956449628,"token_count":1650,"url":"https:\/\/poland-en.insumed-diabetes.com\/useful-articles\/7-normal-blood-sugar-levels-for-women-and-men.-blood-sugar-level-in-pathologies"},"score":4,"id":"358"}
{"text":"Stick to your goals (if you want)!!\nSticking to your goals, especially in terms of physical activities and hobbies, is essential for personal development and achievement. However, one common problem, especially seen around the New Year, is the enthusiasm for joining gyms and workout programs that tend to dwindle by February.\nMotivation fades, routines get disrupted, and often, people find it easier to return to old habits. It\u2019s human nature, but it\u2019s also a roadblock on the path to progress. The same applies to learning dances. Initial enthusiasm can get you started, but it\u2019s persistence and patience that allow you to improve and excel.\nIn dance, one can grasp the basics in a few weeks, but to truly master a dance form, it requires dedication over months, sometimes even years. The subtleties, the nuances, the expressions all come with practice and patience. There\u2019s no shortcut to becoming a good dancer.\nWhen it comes to attending dance festivals or workshops, it\u2019s about expanding your dance vocabulary, meeting like-minded individuals, and experiencing the joy of dance in a different setting. However, these opportunities become more beneficial as you progress and have a solid foundation to build upon.\nRemember, when you feel like giving up, revisit your original intentions and motivations. Keep your goals in sight, and remember that progress is often slow but it is also rewarding. Stick to your goals if they still resonate with you, and you\u2019ll find joy in your journey as well as your destination.\nall about motivation\u2026\nDancing, as joyous as it can be, can sometimes become a challenge when it comes to consistent practice. The key is to understand that it\u2019s perfectly normal to experience periods of diminished motivation. Rather than viewing this as a setback, you can use it as an opportunity for growth and reflection.\nRemember why you started dancing in the first place. Was it for the pure joy of movement, the social connection, or the love for the music? Reconnecting with your initial spark can rekindle your passion and drive. Additionally, setting small, achievable goals can provide a sense of direction and purpose.\nUse variety to your advantage. Try different styles, techniques, or dances that challenge you or reignite your interest. Attend workshops, classes or dance socials to learn new moves, meet new people and gain fresh perspectives.\nAlternatively, make practicing a fun activity. Dancing is not just about perfecting moves, it\u2019s also about enjoyment. So, incorporate elements that make it fun for you. It could be dancing to your favorite songs, improvising, or even making silly dance videos.\nLastly, understand the power of rest. Sometimes, taking a break can actually boost your motivation. Allow yourself time to recharge and return with renewed energy. Ultimately, dancing should bring happiness and fulfillment. So, keep it light-hearted and enjoyable, and the motivation to practice will follow naturally.\nWhat if you mess up? Dealing with fear and failure\nA common challenge faced by dancers is making mistakes during a dance.\nOk, let\u2019s see how to handle such situations. Mistakes are inevitable in dance, as in any learning process. However, the fear of making a mistake can stifle one\u2019s progress and dampen the joy of dancing.\nDancers are encouraged to embrace mistakes as part of the learning journey. Rather than being deterred by them, dancers should view these slip-ups as opportunities for growth and improvement. Mistakes can reveal areas that require more practice or understanding, allowing dancers to hone their skills and technique further.\nAdditionally, let me highlight the importance of maintaining a positive and supportive dance environment.. Dancers should be kind to themselves and to their partners when mistakes occur. This creates a more conducive atmosphere for learning and enjoyment, reducing stress and enhancing the overall dance experience.\nThe purpose of dancing is to enjoy oneself and connect with others. While perfection may be a goal for some, the true essence of dance lies in its capacity to bring joy, foster connections, and encourage self-expression. So, instead of fearing mistakes, dancers should focus on the fun and connection that dance provides.\nDance like nobody is watching..\nEmbracing the philosophy of \u201cdance like nobody\u2019s watching\u201d can unlock a new level of freedom and joy in your dance journey. This mantra encourages self-expression and confidence, reminding us that dance is, above all, an outlet for enjoyment and self-expression.\nWhen we dance as if we\u2019re invisible to judgement, we remove the pressures of performance, the need to impress or get it \u2018right\u2019. This liberates us to experiment, make mistakes, and most importantly, learn. The dance floor becomes a playground, rather than a stage.\nSelf-consciousness can often be a barrier in our dance development. When we\u2019re too focused on how we look, we may inhibit our movement, limit our creativity, and curb our potential. Embracing the \u2018dance like nobody\u2019s watching\u2019 mindset can help us overcome this hurdle.\nFurthermore, there\u2019s a contagious energy about someone dancing uninhibitedly. It uplifts those around them, inspiring others to let go of their own inhibitions.\nSo next time you step onto the dance floor, remember to leave your self-consciousness at the door. Give yourself permission to dance like nobody\u2019s watching. Let your movements be guided by the rhythm, your mood, your energy, not the eyes of others. Dance with joy, dance with abandon, dance like an \u2018idiot\u2019 if you want to, because that\u2019s where the magic truly lies.\nCreativity plays an integral role in the world of dance, giving it a life force that sets it apart from other forms of movement. Far from being a skill exclusive to artistic geniuses, creativity in dance is accessible to everyone and is an essential ingredient for personal development and enrichment.\nDancing provides a unique medium for creative expression, allowing dancers to interpret music and mood through movement. It\u2019s about more than just mastering steps or following patterns; it\u2019s about creating a personal dance language that\u2019s unique to you.\nWhen you allow yourself to be creative in your dance, you open up to more freedom, enjoyment, and personal connection with your partner and the music. It provides an avenue for exploration and experimentation, enabling you to discover new ways of moving and expressing yourself.\nCreativity also extends to problem-solving in dance. Whether it\u2019s figuring out how to execute a challenging move or adapt to a partner\u2019s dance style, being creative can lead to unexpected solutions.\nIn order to foster creativity, it\u2019s important to develop an open mindset that welcomes new ideas and experiences. Learning from different dance styles, teachers, and partners can provide a wealth of inspiration. And remember, creativity is not about being perfect or the best\u2014it\u2019s about enjoying the process of exploration, expression, and growth in your dance journey.\nHow much dancing do you want in your life?\nDancing has a lot of psychological aspects to it\u2026\nThere are deeper impacts and significance of dance beyond the physical aspect. Dance is not just a medium for physical exercise, it\u2019s also an avenue for emotional expression and mental enrichment.\nDancing is a unique art form that merges the physical with the emotional, and in doing so, it enables individuals to experience and express a broad spectrum of feelings, ranging from joy and exhilaration to melancholy and introspection. It is a holistic activity that engages not just the body, but the mind and spirit as well.\nDance is also a powerful tool for personal growth and development. It teaches perseverance, patience, and discipline as individuals strive to master complex routines and movements. It instills confidence as they improve and start expressing themselves through their movements. The article highlights the transformative power of dance, stating that dancing can change the way individuals view themselves and the world.\nThe connection between dancers in a partner dance is also emphasized. This non-verbal communication and connection can be a profoundly intimate experience, fostering empathy and understanding. Dance transcends boundaries, making it a universal language that brings people together.\nIn summary, the article underlines that dance is not just about physical exertion or aesthetic appeal, it\u2019s a holistic activity that promotes emotional expression, mental resilience, personal growth, and social connection.","metadata":{"date":1708505246000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947473401.5\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240221070402-20240221100402-00599.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9317333102,"token_count":1755,"url":"https:\/\/socialdancecommunity.com\/becoming-the-dancer-you-want-to-be-improve-your-dancing\/"},"score":3,"id":"359"}
{"text":"How Do You Add Acid to Spaghetti Sauce?\nSpaghetti sauce is a versatile and delicious dish that can be enjoyed in many ways. While the traditional recipe calls for tomatoes to provide the acidity, sometimes you may find that your sauce lacks that tangy punch.\nAdding acid to your spaghetti sauce can help balance the flavors and enhance the overall taste. In this article, we will explore different ways to add acid to your spaghetti sauce and elevate its flavor profile.\nWhy Add Acid?\nAcidity is an essential component of any good spaghetti sauce. It helps cut through the richness of other ingredients, such as meat or cheese, and brings a bright and refreshing taste to the dish. Acidic ingredients also play a crucial role in balancing the sweetness of tomatoes, creating a harmonious flavor.\n1. Tomatoes as Natural Acidity\nThe primary source of acidity in spaghetti sauce comes from tomatoes themselves.\nThe natural acids present in ripe tomatoes, including citric acid and malic acid, provide a tangy kick to the sauce. However, if you\u2019re using canned or store-bought tomato products for your sauce, they may have lower acidity levels due to processing methods.\n- Use fresh ripe tomatoes whenever possible.\n- If using canned tomato products, opt for brands that mention high acidity or San Marzano tomatoes.\n- Add lemon juice or vinegar if needed later in the cooking process.\n2. Citrus Juices\nCitrus juices like lemon juice or lime juice can be excellent sources of acidity for your spaghetti sauce. They not only add tanginess but also bring a refreshing aroma and brightness to the dish.\n- Add a squeeze of fresh lemon or lime juice towards the end of cooking to preserve its vibrant flavor.\n- Start with a small amount and taste as you go to avoid overpowering the other flavors.\nVinegar is another popular choice for adding acidity to spaghetti sauce.\nIt comes in various types, such as red wine vinegar, white wine vinegar, balsamic vinegar, and apple cider vinegar, each offering its unique flavor profile. Vinegar not only adds acidity but also imparts a slight tang and depth to the sauce.\n- Choose a type of vinegar that complements your sauce\u2019s overall taste.\n- Add a small amount at a time and taste as you go until you achieve the desired level of acidity.\nWine can be an excellent addition to spaghetti sauce not only for acidity but also for enhancing the flavors. Red wine or white wine can both work well depending on your preference and the type of sauce you are making.\n- Select a dry wine that complements the ingredients in your sauce.\n- Add it early in the cooking process, allowing it to reduce and infuse its flavors into the sauce.\n5. Other Acidic Ingredients\nApart from citrus juices, vinegar, and wine, there are other ingredients that can contribute acidity to your spaghetti sauce:\n- Balsamic glaze: Use as a finishing touch for added complexity and sweetness along with acidity.\n- Capers: These pickled flower buds offer a unique briny and acidic flavor.\n- Olives: Depending on the variety, olives can provide a subtle to moderate level of acidity.\nAdding these ingredients can introduce different layers of acidity, enhancing the overall taste of your spaghetti sauce.\nAcidity is a crucial aspect of any good spaghetti sauce. Whether you use natural tomato acidity, citrus juices, vinegar, wine, or other acidic ingredients, adding acid helps balance flavors and brings a refreshing tanginess to your dish.\nExperiment with different options to find the perfect balance for your taste buds. Enjoy your flavorful and zesty spaghetti sauce!","metadata":{"date":1708644505000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947473871.23\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240222225655-20240223015655-00798.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.8860131502,"token_count":766,"url":"https:\/\/tonychans.com\/how-do-you-add-acid-to-spaghetti-sauce\/"},"score":2,"id":"360"}
{"text":"There is a shift in perspective of how to design streets. Instead of focusing solely on automobile needs, streets and pathways are being designed for all people, regardless of age, ability or modality. Missouri leaders and citizens are gaining support for the national movement called Complete Streets, which is focused on making community streets, roadways and sidewalks accessible, safe, efficient and useable for all people.\nIt is important to note that there is no one way to build a Complete Street or Complete Community. Each community decides what features or services they need. For examples of Complete Streets designs and how they can look in your community, visit the Street Design Examples page in the Resources section.\nWhy are Complete Streets important?\nThe benefits of Complete Streets extends far beyond transportation. Complete Streets are focused on implementing policies and plans to create equitable, healthy, safe and viable communities where citizens can work, play and prosper.\nWhen streets are designed to move cars as quickly as possible, it creates an unsafe environment for pedestrians. Complete Streets puts pedestrians of all ages and abilities first, ensuring the safety of all community members. Additionally, incorporating Complete Streets can also result in fewer vehicle crashes within the community.\nComplete Streets can have a positive impact on both physical health and environmental health. When people choose to bike, walk or use public transit to get their destinations, they are increasing physical activity (which reduces the burden of chronic disease), and they are also reducing carbon emissions (which is good for the health of the environment). The resources below are just a glimpse of all the Complete Streets health impacts.\nCommunities that implement Complete Streets designs experience increased foot traffic to local businesses and increased individual property value. The aesthetic appeal of safer, more active streets draws in more businesses to the community as well. This economic impact is a compelling benefit for key policy and decision makers to implement Complete Streets in their communities.\nComplete Streets increase access to transportation for the most vulnerable populations, including children, the elderly, individuals with low income, and those with disabilities. Ultimately, Complete Streets reduce barriers for all citizens by creating more connected communities, providing access to food, education, employment , health care and other opportunities for those with no other means of transportation.","metadata":{"date":1708625489000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947473824.13\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240222161802-20240222191802-00599.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9402855039,"token_count":444,"url":"https:\/\/www.mocompletestreets.com\/what-are-complete-streets\/"},"score":4,"id":"361"}

The individual is conscious and sufficiently intact cognitively to be able to communicate with eye movements. Electroencephalography results are normal in locked-in syndrome.\nTotal locked-in syndrome, or completely locked-in state (CLIS), is a version of locked-in syndrome wherein the eyes are paralyzed as well. Fred Plum and Jerome B.

The subsequent query from the server results in needless battery drain.\nHere\u2019s more background on the problem and how you can deal with it.\n\u201cWake up. It\u2019s time to go to sleep.\u201d\nApplications often \u201cforget\u201d to close their socket after they are done with it. Then, after some amount of time without data activity, the server times the socket out and closes it.\nSocket termination in TCP requires a four-way handshake, so the server has to send a FIN packet to the device, which usually takes the device from the low-power dormant state to the higher-power active state. The device goes idle for a bit, then back to dormant. It\u2019s like waking somebody up to tell them that it\u2019s time to go to sleep.\nLook at the example in the diagram. The red (1) shows the device jumping from dormant to active mode to send and receive data normally for a few seconds. Once finished, the cellular radio drops to a power-saving idle mode (2) in case that it\u2019s needed again. After about 15 seconds of inactivity, the radio goes dormant (3).\nBut the app has left the socket open (hanging). The server doesn\u2019t like loose ends, so it sends its FIN packet to the device. This rouses the radio from dormant to active again (4), the same as if it were sending\/receiving data for the app. Worse yet, the radio follows the normal curve back down to idle for another 15 seconds, wasting more power (5).\nBegin to get the idea?\nThe phone has to bring up the radio for a simple, easily avoidable handshake because the server has asked the device for something that the app should have provided in the first place. If no other traffic moves between the device and the network, the connection is a complete waste of several hundred milliamperes.\nAssuming that the app uses the network four times in an hour, the simple fix of having the app close the socket when finished can reduce network power consumption by about 20 percent, which would be the difference between eight and ten hours of standby power.\nThe lesson is: Program your app to close sockets when it has finished with them. Otherwise, the phone consumes power to bring up the radio for a needless handshake with the server.\nSo, to paraphrase Wayne, you need to know what your app is doing with the cellular radio, when it\u2019s doing it and how to turn it off when the app no longer needs it.\n- Watch Wayne\u2019s Uplinq presentation, \u201cMinimum Power Usage, Maximum Performance.\u201d\n- Read our white paper, \"When Mobile Apps Use Too Much Power: A Developer Guide for Android App Performance,\u201d for more background and ideas on mobile apps and power consumption.\nQuestions?

{"text":"NOTE: Full spoilers for this episode of, \u201cAgents of S.H.I.E.L.D.\u201d are present in this review\nWith the Zephyr having jumped through time again, continuing to follow the trail of the Chronicoms, the heroes of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. have now found themselves in another new era, against another new obstacle. Longtime Marvel Cinematic Universe enthusiasts who have enjoyed ABC\u2019s Marvel Television offerings in particular are also in for a treat this week! \u201cAlien Commies from the Future!\u201d displaces the team in 1955 this time, conveniently near Area 51, which just so happens to be where the Chronicoms are planning to strike next. Since Area 51 is a S.H.I.E.L.D. base, this inspires Coulson and Simmons to employ some creative means through which to sneak into the base, and stop the covert Chronicom attack.\nThis mission begins in a rather challenging fashion, after the agents discover a high-ranking defense agent, Gerald Sharpe, within a nearby diner. Kidnapping Sharpe and hiding him on the Zephyr, Mack, Yo-Yo and May then take turns interrogating him. Sharpe, however, being a typical American patriot stereotype of the era, laughs off every attempt at interrogation, since every agent that attempts to talk to him isn\u2019t Caucasian. Even when Deke takes a run at the guy, he still mostly gets nothing as well, at least beyond a key bit of intel that puts the rest of the mission into focus; The new cold fusion reactor that S.H.I.E.L.D. is looking to test at Area 51 doesn\u2019t actually work, because nothing on Earth can power it. That\u2019s bad news, since a Chronicom power source isn\u2019t from Earth, and can power, and subsequently overload, the reactor just fine!\nSo, how do the agents try to break into the base and solve the situation? By having Coulson impersonate Sharpe, while Simmons impersonates none other than Peggy Carter herself! Yes, just as the previous 1931 events ended up tying into 2011 movie, Captain America: The First Avenger, S.H.I.E.L.D.\u2019s crew now landing in 1955 allows for an excellent tie-in to ABC\u2019s frustratingly short-lived \u2018event series\u2019, Agent Carter. This is very exciting, since it could mean that the final season of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. may actually fill in some key gaps from the Agent Carter storyline, particularly since that show\u2019s second and final season ultimately ended on a currently unresolved cliffhanger. This promise nicely takes shape before long as well, when Simmons ends up being busted by none other than Peggy Carter\u2019s former colleague and love interest, Daniel Sousa, with Enver Gjokaj reprising his role as Sousa from Agent Carter!\nSince we never got a chance to see S.H.I.E.L.D. actually form on Agent Carter, which was likely the finale that the showrunners had originally hoped for, before ABC\u2019s premature cancellation of the show, this episode finally answers a few lingering questions about what became of Sousa after his role on Agent Carter. Sousa has apparently lost touch with Peggy in the years since Agent Carter\u2019s second and final season, seemingly cementing that he isn\u2019t Peggy\u2019s mysterious husband that was alluded to during the events of Captain America: The Winter Soldier (which may very well be Steve Rogers in current MCU canon, considering how Avengers: Endgame ended), but did end up becoming the head of S.H.I.E.L.D.\u2019s West Coast division. This presents Sousa as an interesting unwitting antagonist to the present-day S.H.I.E.L.D. crew, particularly when he arrests Simmons and Coulson before they can root out any undercover Chronicoms, forcing Daisy to pose as a CIA liaison, in order to free her friends.\nThe material with Sousa is pretty great overall, and next week\u2019s episode promises to flesh it out even more! That\u2019s awesome, since the S.H.I.E.L.D. crew is mostly split up effectively at the actual Area 51 base this week. May and Yo-Yo eventually give up interrogating Sharpe to assist at the base to boot, causing an apparent tear gas attack that eventually roots out the Chronicom hidden among the researchers. I have to say, Coulson and Simmons asking a series of increasingly inexplicable questions to provoke human reactions among the scientists is a lot funnier, but I guess May and Yo-Yo using tear gas is a little faster. This definitely makes for a better payoff than May and Yo-Yo impotently trying to squeeze intel out of Sharpe too, which mostly wastes time, and leaves Mack especially not accomplishing much this week. Deke does use this interrogation to successfully figure out the means of the Chronicoms\u2019 attack, but even this takes far longer than it probably should.\nRegardless, this episode still presents a pretty exciting climax. May and Yo-Yo break off to stop a female Chronicom from detonating the reactor, which would simultaneously wipe out all of S.H.I.E.L.D.\u2019s highest-ranking agents and think tank, including Sousa! At the same time, Coulson tries to fight off a male Chronicom, creating a nicely intense climax that almost leads to Yo-Yo being taken out in particular! Ultimately though, Simmons and Daisy manage to rig up an EMP that disables the Chronicoms before their plan is successful, leading to both of them self-destructing before their technology can be appropriated. Coulson, meanwhile, is also deactivated, appearing to undergo some sort of strange glitch, right as Sousa decides to try and get to the bottom of what he\u2019s up against. Hopefully Sousa has shaken off his difficult days of fighting against Whitney Frost and Zero Matter as well, because he\u2019s about to have his world rocked, in what\u2019s hopefully an equally exciting Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. episode next week!\n\u201cAlien Commies from the Future!\u201d presents a very rewarding and unexpected Agent Carter crossover, thanks to the surprise re-appearance of Daniel Sousa, immediately making the agents\u2019 arrival in 1955 feel especially exciting! It\u2019s a bit annoying that several of the heroes had to be wasted on a pointless interrogation subplot this week, which mostly ends up being played for cheap laughs, but the events at Area 51 proper nicely helped to make up for this. Even more thrilling as well is the fact that neither May nor Yo-Yo appear to be in top fighting shape at this point, with Yo-Yo\u2019s Inhuman powers appearing to not function properly anymore, while May appears to be in the throes of heightened aggression, anxiety and PTSD. Both women clearly have some major battle scars from the events of last season, and they couldn\u2019t have come at a worse time, considering that the Chronicoms remain active in 1955! With the Chronicoms repelled for now however, I\u2019m currently most looking forward to hopefully filling in some more stubborn holes in Marvel Cinematic Universe canon, personally, now that ABC and Marvel Television have gained a second chance to rectify the unresolved origin story of S.H.I.E.L.D. proper.\nAgents of S.H.I.E.L.D. delivers an exciting crossover with Agent Carter this week, after the heroes land in 1955, just in time for another Chronicom attack.\nReader Rating0 Votes\nTHE GOOD STUFF\nExciting new 1955 backdrop\nAwesome Agent Carter connection through Daniel Sousa\nMay and Yo-Yo struggling in combat\nTHE NOT-SO-GOOD STUFF\nMack especially being wasted on a pointless interorgation","metadata":{"date":1709576934000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947476464.74\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240304165127-20240304195127-00599.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9576708078,"token_count":1691,"url":"https:\/\/www.eggplante.com\/2020\/06\/11\/agents-of-s-h-i-e-l-d-7-3-alien-commies-from-the-future-review\/"},"score":1,"id":"367"}

Whatever the reason \u2013 being unfaithful, having hidden debts or addiction, can be a very painful time for couples sometimes leading to the end of the relationship.

{"text":"Definition: In business terms, a strike can be understood as a curtailment of work, due to the collective refusal of workers to work, which occurs as a response to employee grievances. It involves, dropping out of work by any number of workers, employed in a particular industry, with an aim of creating pressure on the employers, to accept their demands relating to pay scale, working conditions, trade practices and so forth.\nA strike is a situation in which the workers act in concert for stopping or denying to resume work. The relationship between the employer and employee continue to exist though in a state of hostile suspension.\nCauses of Strike\n- Dispute relating to minimum wages.\n- Salary and incentive issues.\n- Increment is not up to the performance.\n- Dissatisfaction with the policies of the company.\n- Hours of work and interval timings.\n- Holidays and leaves with pay.\n- Bonus, Provident Fund, and gratuity.\n- Withdrawal of any facility or allowance.\n- Wrongful dismissal of workmen.\nThe most obvious reason of strike is the non-payment of wages or salaries to the workers of the factory by the employers.\nTypes of Strike\n- Hunger Strike: Strike in which the employees go on fasting, near the workplace or at the residence of the employer, to force him\/her redress their grievances is called hunger strike.\n- Economic Strike: Economic Strike is the cessation of work by the labors with an aim of imposing their economic demands like wages and bonus.\nIn such strike, the workers raise their voices to increase their pay, improve working conditions, facilitate them with allowances, perquisites, and add-on benefits.\n- Stay-in Strike: A type of strike, in which the employees come to the office, as usual, take their seats but do not work and also deny to leave the office premises, when asked to do so.\nWhen such an act is performed in combination, it amounts to stay-in strike. Alternately called as sit-down, pen-down or tool-down strike.\n- Go-slow Strike: Otherwise called as a slow-down strike, is one in which the workers do not stop working, but slow down the entire process by deliberately delaying the production, which results in the reduction of output.\nThis amounts to a serious case of misconduct, whereby the workmen pretend to be engaged in the work and entitled to full wages. It is more harmful than the complete cessation of work by employees, as the resources get wasted, due to delayed working of employees.\n- Sympathetic Strike: A type of strike in which the workers of one department, unit, division, or industry, go on strike, in support of the workers of another department, unit, division, or industry, who are already on strike.\nThis may be an unjustified seizure of rights of the employer, who is not even involved in the conflict.\nStrike is one of the powerful tool of collective bargaining, used by trade unions and labor associations to compel the employer to grant several concessions. It can also be used to protest certain terms of former or proposed agreement amidst the labor and management.\nA prolonged strike may result in lock-out, which is a strategy used by employers to make trade unions settle down with their terms.","metadata":{"date":1709433599000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947476180.67\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240303011622-20240303041622-00399.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9597983956,"token_count":681,"url":"https:\/\/businessjargons.com\/strike.html"},"score":3,"id":"369"}

{"text":"We celebrate Older Driver Safety Awareness Week in the first full week of December, from December 6 to 10 this year, to make the roads a safe place for the older generation. The elderly may experience several challenges such as weak eyesight, hearing issues, dementia, sleep disorders, and physical disabilities that may impact their driving. These drivers are more at risk of experiencing car crashes that often lead to death. It is also important to note that traveling in vehicles is often necessary for the elderly who cannot walk for long intervals or distances. Do your part in making the world a better place for the older drivers and celebrate Older Driver Safety Awareness Week.\nHistory of Older Driver Safety Awareness Week\nBased on statistics from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there are about 44 million licensed drivers over 65. These individuals often choose driving over walking due to certain disabilities, illnesses, or lack of strength. However, it\u2019s tragic that around 7,700 of these older drivers die in motor vehicle accidents annually, and more than 257,000 sustain severe injuries and have to visit the E.R.\nCan these accidents be avoided? The answer is yes. If all drivers wear a seatbelt and take note of the required security measures, they are less likely to experience fatal injuries even if a car crash occurs. It is also important for the younger generation to follow traffic rules keeping in mind that many elders have slow reflexes due to physical ailments and may not be able to save themselves when confronted with a reckless driver.\nThe American Occupational Therapy Association initiated the Older Driver Safety Awareness Week in 2009. To discuss the various aspects of driving awareness for the old, they chose December as a way for families to gather and ponder driver safety. Created in 1917, the American Occupational Therapy Association (AOTA) is a national professional association representing the interests and concerns of occupational therapy practitioners and students. When the elderly are injured in crashes, they are often sent for occupational therapy to improve their movement, so AOTA took note of the problem and dedicated an entire week to it.\nOlder Driver Safety Awareness Week timeline\nAds regarding road safety are published for the first time.\nScientists introduce a scientific response to auto safety problems through crash testing and analyzing the effects of collisions.\nVolvo introduces the three-point seatbelt.\nCongress pushes forth safety standards for new cars.\nOlder Driver Safety Awareness Week FAQs\nWhat does driver safety mean?\nDriver safety assesses the safety of a driver in different traffic conditions.\nWhat is driver awareness training?\nThe course helps drivers understand speed limits and road safety.\nWhat is the most important rule of driving?\nThe most important rule of driving is to focus on the road and avoid accidents.\nHow to Observe Older Driver Safety Awareness Week\nHost a driving session for the elderly\nTeach the elderly in your town about the importance of driving safety and the measures they can take to secure themselves.\nPost about it\nSpread the message through social media by posting about the importance of driving safety and the problems often faced by the elderly.\nCreate awareness regarding driving safety by printing flyers and circulating them around your town. Flyers are more likely to reach the elderly faster.\n5 Interesting Facts About Driving Safety\nDrinking and driving laws\nEnforcing these laws around the world could reduce alcohol-related crashes by 20%.\nTraffic crashes deaths\nMore than 1,2 million people die from crashes every year.\nInjuries and disabilities caused by traffic crashes\nOver 50 million people become victims of crashes every year.\nOnly 45 countries have national drink-and-drive laws that meet best practices.\nDangerous cell phones\nUsing a phone while driving increases your chance of crashing by 400%.\nWhy Older Driver Safety Awareness Week is Important\nIt teaches you to be safe\nThe week is essential since it talks about the importance of driving safety awareness and teaches one to be safe on the road.\nRaises awareness of the problems the elderly face\nThis week plays a great role in bringing the elderly\u2019s problems to the forefront. It also explains precautionary measures that older drivers need to take when on the road.\nIt is informative\nThe week highlights the elderly\u2019s problems and provides solutions that we can apply to increase driving safety awareness.\nOlder Driver Safety Awareness Week dates","metadata":{"date":1709566473000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947476452.25\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240304133241-20240304163241-00899.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.949668467,"token_count":877,"url":"https:\/\/nationaltoday.com\/older-driver-safety-awareness-week\/"},"score":3,"id":"373"}

{"text":"Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a chronic autoimmune disease that affects the central nervous system. In MS, the immune system attacks the protective coating that surrounds nerve fibers, leading to various symptoms such as numbness, difficulty walking, fatigue, and vision problems. MS affects more than 2.3 million people worldwide, and there is currently no cure for the disease. However, recent research has shown promising results in using stem cells to treat MS.\nStem cells are undifferentiated cells that have the ability to develop into different types of cells in the body. They can be found in various tissues, including bone marrow, umbilical cord blood, and adipose tissue. Stem cells have the potential to repair damaged tissues and regenerate new cells, making them a promising candidate for treating various diseases, including MS.\nIn a recent study published in the journal Stem Cell Reports, researchers from the University of Cambridge used stem cells to treat mice with MS-like symptoms. The researchers used mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) derived from bone marrow and adipose tissue. MSCs have the ability to modulate the immune system and promote tissue repair. The researchers found that the MSCs were effective in reducing inflammation and promoting nerve repair in the mice.\nIn another study published in the journal JAMA Neurology, researchers from the University of California, San Francisco, used hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) to treat patients with MS. HSCs are found in bone marrow and have the ability to differentiate into different types of blood cells, including immune cells. The researchers used a chemotherapy treatment to wipe out the patients' immune systems and then used HSCs to rebuild the immune system. The researchers found that the treatment was effective in reducing disease activity and improving symptoms in the patients.\nStem cell therapy shows promising results in treating MS by reducing inflammation and promoting tissue repair. Note however, insurance does not cover these therapies as they are considered experimental and results are not guaranteed.\nInfinite Health IMC\u2019s regenerative medicine approaches to MS have also shown to provide transformative results.

{"text":"Beijing | According to a recent report by the major Swiss bank UBS, the Chinese online education market is on the upswing. While in 2017 he had still identified a market volume of 29 billion yuan (approx. 4.3 billion dollars), UBS Securities assumes that by 2025 the market volume for online education will be equivalent to 104 billion US dollars, which would result in an enormous multiplication. Liu Jiehao, analyst at Consultancy iiMedia, attributes the growth to, among other things, government support for online education, the cultural significance of education and the effects of technological progress. According to the UBS report, parents also play a decisive role in the growing online education market in China, as they have high expectations of their children\u2019s learning efficiency and intend to study at the renowned Beijing University or Tsinghua University, for example. Accordingly, the majority of Chinese parents expect their children to continue learning after attending school, for which online education is a sensible option. Especially in larger cities like Beijing, the advantage of not having to spend time in traffic jams to get to a private instructor is particularly noticeable. Compared to other Asian countries, China is lagging behind in extra-curricular education and tutoring. In Japan and South Korea, for example, 70 percent of parents spend money on appropriate measures to support their children. In China, according to the UBS analysis, only 37 percent. Accordingly, there is a high growth potential that will unfold in the coming years.\nBeitragsbild: \u00a9 everythingpossible \u2013 stock.adobe.com","metadata":{"date":1709221425000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947474843.87\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240229134901-20240229164901-00599.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9510182738,"token_count":319,"url":"https:\/\/www.elearning-journal.com\/en\/2019\/02\/11\/online-education-in-china-is-growing-dynamically\/"},"score":2,"id":"376"}

{"text":"Back in 2011 Gartner advised (IT) leaders to prepare for the transition of their organizations to the converging, aligning and integrating of IT and OT environments.\nIn fact it\u2019s one of the essences of the IoT (although IT and OT convergence goes back earlier, certainly in some of the just mentioned areas). Yet, with IoT is happening faster and at a broader scale than before and Gartner\u2019s words become more actual than ever.\nWith IT and OT converging, the scope of CIO authority may cater to the needs of planning and coordinating a new generation of operational technologies alongside existing information- and administration-focused IT systems (Gartner)\nIn case you\u2019re not familiar with the \u2013 by now \u2013 \u2018good old\u2019 IT versus OT debate: IT is what you think it is. Information technology or the corporate IT team, led by a CIO. OT is operational technology as we\u2019ll see but it\u2019s in the mix of both that interesting things happen. Of the previously mentioned markets IT and OT integration is, for instance, key in building management in the age of IoT.\nAs you probably know the role of IT and of the CIO has been changing for quite some years now (with discussions on multiple forms of IT such as bimodal IT as Gartner calls it and the business role of the IT chief), among others due to the famous increase of IT spending by divisions other than IT itself.\nIT and OT: a distinction that decreasingly is one\nOT has nothing to do with all that but it does add to the discussions on the (future) role of the CIO and IT. OT stands for Operational Technology. As the word says it\u2019s all the technology that you use to run the operational side of your business, traditionally with little IT involvement. In practice we mainly speak about that convergence of IT and OT in the Industrial Internet of Things, Industry 4.0 and in industries such as utilities, manufacturing, etc.\nThink about all those high-tech machines on the factory floor, your fleet of trucks and anything that has four or more wheels and is used for highly technical purposes, drills, industrial robots (where the integration of IT and OT is key in the Internet of Robotic Things), whatever fits in the context of your (operational) business and industrial activities and assets.\nThe convergence of IT and OT in IoT has been going on for a while and there isn\u2019t a strict division between them in the real world.\nIn many businesses with lots of heavy machinery or other forms of OT, CIOs and IT departments will often be closely involved because of the critical role of all that technology, de facto technological convergence and integration (with the network being a first driver when many of these industrial assets started being seen as less stand alone than before) and the ways OT is being looked upon from the same view as IT in regards with, for instance, security.\nStill, in some areas the distinction is clear. You won\u2019t quickly see an IT worker repair a high-tech oil drill and, the other way around, you won\u2019t see an engineer who takes care of the technologies to assemble cars, sit in a meeting on using predictive analytics to protect the corporate network from cyberthreats. But, as said, the lines between both do blur and the Internet of Things is no stranger to that evolution.\nHow the Internet of Things brings IT and OT together\nYou now can imagine why the whole debate on \u2018IT versus OT\u2019 or, more correct, the convergence of IT and OT, has been mainly held in specific industries and business functions, with the Industrial Internet (or Industry 4.0) being most involved.\nWhen looking for an image and as way of an example we found this 2014 blog post, infographic and study by Siemens in the utility space where Siemens identifies cost and interoperability are the biggest challenges in the convergence of IT and OT but where the need to get IT and OT out of their separate and traditional silos in order to reap the benefits of advanced metering and smart grid systems is stressed.\nNow, how does the Internet of Things come into the picture? In a post, on the advent of the DX economy, we looked at some predictions by IDC for 2016 and beyond (with beyond being that DX or digital transformation economy).\nAmong the \u2018most fertile areas for DX\u2019, as IDC puts it, will be the Internet of Things. That is probably not a surprise. As mentioned, the Internet of Things today de facto is mainly \u2018happening\u2019 in industrial environments with the Industral Internet of Things (IIoT).\nAnd it\u2019s exactly in these industries where, among others, IDC also expects most IoT development to happen, at least in the next few years and even if IoT devices and solutions, we quote, \u201chave the potential to redefine competitive advantage in virtually every industry\u201d.\nThe link between the Internet of Things and the IT and OT debate is clear. After all, the IoT is mainly about automating processes using connected devices with a capacity to gather, receive and send information, embed intelligence and connectivity into devices and set up processes and applications that open up a realm of new possibilities with the proper tools to analyze data, automate and \u2018write\u2019 applications and develop APIs, putting these devices at work.\nUtilities are realizing that to reap the full benefits of advanced metering and smart grid systems, IT and OT must work together (Lisa Caswell, Siemens)\nManaging the exploitation of IT and OT when IoT drives transformation\nAs we are talking information, networks, connectivity, data, ecosystems and apps, we are talking IT, especially as all this connectivity and certainly, data and information (IT still stands for Information Technology) needs to be managed, secured, stored, processed, routed, leveraged and so on.\nIn an \u2018industrial\u2019 context it\u2019s not different. It\u2019s an environment where software and developers also find fertile ground (think connected cars and their software updates), as do IT experts with their knowledge of code (another big one in the evolution towards the DX economy according to IDC) but certainly also experts in typical IT areas such as security, a major concern in the context of IoT.\nAs we\u2019re still relatively early in the whole IoT evolution but evolutions occur rapidly, the call for the convergence of IT and OT gets louder. In many industries IT and OT convergence already happens since quite some time (oil and gas is just one of the many, on top of the previously mentioned ones), yet in practice it remains a challenge in IIoT developments.\nSo, it\u2019s not a coincidence that IDC highlighted the integration of IT and OT at the technology, process, security and organization levels as a key success factor and key evolution\/prediction.\nIn the meantime here is a quote from Gartner\u2019s mentioned 2011 press release on the convergence of IT and OT: \u201cWith IT and OT converging, the scope of CIO authority may cater to the needs of planning and coordinating a new generation of operational technologies alongside existing information- and administration-focused IT systems\u201d.\nGartner also stressed how the key change for CIOs may be that their role moves from leading the IT delivery organization to leading the exploitation of the business assets of processes, information and relationships across all technologies in the enterprise \u2014 IT or OT, whether delivered, supported, or managed by the formal IT organization or elsewhere.\nConvergence of IT and OT, with all the challenges and functional questions it implies, is simply a must in the IIoT.\nThe graphic below, from the Industrial Ethernet book, shows various components of IT and OT.\nAs the author says, that convergence (challenge) is not just one of technologies but also about new ways of thinking, which tends to be a challenge indeed when two different worlds, which have worked separately and with completely different systems, technologies and vendors, (have to) collide in the context of IIoT and the Industrial Internet.\nAll images are owned by the mentioned companies and\/or sites, serving as an illustration.

{"text":"A lottery is a method of raising funds by drawing lots for prizes. In the United States, state lotteries raise billions of dollars each year. The money is used to support a variety of state programs and services. The name comes from the Latin word lotere, which means \u201cto draw lots.\u201d Lotteries have been around for centuries. They were first introduced in Europe during the Roman Empire, mainly as entertainment at dinner parties. The guests would place a bet on a ticket and the winner would receive fancy items such as dinnerware. The lottery became more popular in the 17th century when it was formally introduced by King Francis I of France.\nThe modern state-sponsored lotteries began in the 1960s. They are usually run by public corporations, not private firms that profit from selling the tickets. The states create a monopoly for themselves and then establish a commission to run the operations. The initial offerings are generally limited, but new games are added over time to maintain interest in the game and generate additional revenues. The new games may include scratch-off tickets, instant lotteries, keno, sports pools, and other variations of traditional games.\nLotteries generate substantial revenues and are widely accepted by the general public, although they are not without controversy. Some critics believe that lotteries encourage compulsive gambling and have a regressive impact on lower-income groups. Others point out that the proceeds of lotteries are a legitimate alternative to sin taxes, which burden those who cannot afford to pay them.\nRegardless of the debate over the merits of the lottery, its popularity is undeniable. In the United States alone, more than 60 million people play the games every year. The industry has a long history of evolving in response to consumer demand and changing economic conditions.\nIn many states, the earliest lotteries were little more than traditional raffles, with the public purchasing tickets for a future drawing. However, innovations in the 1970s transformed the industry. Instant games, such as scratch-off tickets, now account for a large percentage of state lottery revenues. These tickets have smaller prize amounts and offer relatively high odds of winning, on the order of 1 in 4.\nJackson\u2019s story is an interesting look at the human capacity for violence. The villagers participate in this horrible event because it is tradition. Even Tessie Hutchinson, the woman who wins, does not stop to consider how terrible it is that she will be stoned to death. It is a reminder that we need to think about the consequences of our actions before committing them. It is also an example of how blind obedience to tradition can be a dangerous thing.","metadata":{"date":1709297891000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947475311.93\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240301125520-20240301155520-00299.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9725281596,"token_count":538,"url":"https:\/\/penzionzamecek.com\/index.php\/2023\/05\/27\/the-history-of-the-lottery\/"},"score":4,"id":"379"}
{"text":"- Complications with Diabetes\nDiabetes is a chronic, life\u2013long condition that requires careful control. Without proper management it can lead to various complications such as cardiovascular disease, kidney failure, blindness and nerve damage.\nLow blood sugar (hypoglycaemia)\nA person who takes insulin is going to face the problem of their blood sugar falling too low at some point (because they have overestimated the insulin they need, have exercised more than anticipated or have not eaten enough). Hypoglycaemia can be corrected rapidly by eating some sugar. If it is not corrected it can lead to the person losing consciousness.\nIt is important that the person with diabetes recognises the signs of hypoglycaemia.\nWhen the body breaks down fats, acidic waste products called ketones are produced. The body cannot tolerate large amounts of ketones and will try to get rid of them through the urine. However, the body cannot release all the ketones and they build up in your blood, causing ketoacidosis. Ketoacidosis is a severe condition caused by lack of insulin. It mainly affects people with type 1 diabetes.\nLactic acidosis is the build up of lactic acid in the body. Cells make lactic acid when they use glucose for energy. If too much lactic acid stays in the body, the balance tips and the person begins to feel ill. Lactic acidosis is rare and mainly affects people with type 2 diabetes.\nPeople with diabetes are more prone to bacterial and fungal infections. Bacterial infections include sties and boils. Fungal infections include athlete\u2019s foot, ringworm and vaginal infections.\nEye disease (retinopathy)\nEye disease, or retinopathy, is the leading cause of blindness and visual impairment in adults in developed societies. About 2% of all people who have had diabetes for 15 years become blind, while about 10% develop a severe visual impairment.\nIDF fact sheet on diabetes and eye disease\nKidney disease (nephropathy)\nDiabetes is the leading cause of kidney disease (nephropathy). About one third of all people with diabetes develop kidney disease and approximately 20% of people with type 1 diabetes develop kidney failure.\nIDF fact sheet on diabetes and kidney disease\nNerve disease (neuropathy)\nDiabetic nerve disease, or neuropathy affects at least half of all people with diabetes. There are different types of nerve disease which can result in a loss of sensation in the feet or in some cases the hands, pain in the foot and problems with the functioning of different parts of the body including the heart, the eye, the stomach, the bladder and the penis. A lack of sensation in the feet can lead to people with diabetes injuring their feet without realising it. These injuries can lead to ulcers and possibly amputation.\nDiseases of the circulatory system\nDisease of the circulatory system, or cardiovascular disease, accounts for 75% of all deaths among people with diabetes of European origin. In the USA, corony heart disease is present in between 8% and 20% of people with diabetes over 45 years of age.

{"text":"Sometimes it seems like Buddhism doesn\u2019t have much relevance to environmental problems. Can Buddhist philosophy solve climate change? Can meditation bring back lost species? I think about these things much of the time, trying to find my way in a world of plummeting ecosystem health. Every semester my students say, \u201cBut what can one person do?\u201d If I don\u2019t have some good answers, they won\u2019t be able to move forward with the important work of saving the planet.\nSo when they ask me, \u201cWhere should I begin?,\u201d I usually reply, \u201cWhat do you care about the most?\u201d Since the problems are endless, no one can possibly address all of them. It is important to have a place to actually accomplish something, to be grounded in the physical, political, and economic realities of a specific situation. Because most environmental work is incremental and cumulative, you need a lot of motivation to hang in there over the long haul. I recommend listening for what calls you to respond; this is a good way to identify personally meaningful work. And yes, that work can be Buddhist practice. Here I offer several approaches based in Buddhist principles that can be applied to any environmental work.\nBeing with the Suffering\nIf you look at the state of the world today, the suffering\u2014of plants and animals, forests and rivers, and local and indigenous peoples\u2014is enormous. Global agriculture, urban sprawl, and industrial development have caused wide-scale loss of habitat, many local-species extinctions, severe land and water degradation, and unstable climate. In the last century, the rate of loss has accelerated significantly, to the point of threatening ecosystem health and the continuity of life.\nThe first noble truth begins with the suffering that arises from the inevitability of change and loss. Facing this suffering and the delusions it generates is where Buddhist practice begins. In the precepts of the Order of Interbeing, Thich Nhat Hanh urges, \u201cDo not avoid contact with suffering or close your eyes before suffering.\u201d He directs students to be present with suffering to understand the nature of existence. This requires patience and equanimity in the face of disturbing realities\u2014a clear-cut forest reduced to stumps, a once-lush river deadened by chemical waste, a coral reef blasted by dynamite fishing. It is not easy to gaze clear-eyed at these troubling results of human activity.\nMost of the time we would rather not think about the suffering caused by our actions. Yet from a Buddhist perspective, this is the best place to start, for it is grounded in reality, not idealized projection. Mindful awareness is all about direct experience of the actual state of things. The authenticity of such perception is freeing and motivating at the same time. Practices that quiet and focus the mind can provide a stable mental base from which to observe the whole catastrophe of human impact. To be with environmental suffering means being willing to be with the suffering produced by your own cultural conditioning toward other-than-human beings. Those of us in the West have been raised to see forests and rivers as potential resources. Human-centered views are one of the greatest deterrents to being fully present with other living beings. If you see the environment as primarily for human use\u2014whether for food, shelter, recreation, or spiritual development\u2014you may not see how others suffer under the thumb of human dominance.\nBeing with suffering means learning about what is going on in a given environmental conflict. The four noble truths can be applied as a framework for diagnosis by posing four questions, each question corresponding to one of the truths: First, what is the environmental problem or suffering? Second, what are the causes of the suffering? Third, what would put an end to the suffering? And fourth, what is the path to realize this goal?\nThis analysis is deceptively simple, yet it can be quite radical if you include all forms of suffering\u2014that of people, animals, trees, species, habitats, and ecosystems. This method of diagnosis provides straightforward guidelines for how to become informed, and therefore more able to bear witness to the suffering involved. It also provides analytical balance to the emotions you inevitably feel when you glimpse another being\u2019s suffering.\nCultivating Systems Mind\nSolving environmental problems almost always requires some understanding of ecological principles, or what I call \u201csystems thinking.\u201d The Buddhist principle of dependent co-arising provides an excellent foundation for systems thinking. According to this perspective, all events and beings are interdependent and mutually co-create each other. Thus the universe is seen as dynamic in all dimensions and scales of activity, with every action affecting and generating others in turn.\nYou may be familiar with the Chinese Buddhist metaphor known as the Jewel Net of Indra, which expresses this dynamic of interdependence. Imagine a fishnet-like set of linked lines extending ad infinitum across horizontal and vertical dimensions of space. Then add more nets criss-crossing on the diagonals. Imagine an endless number of these nets criss-crossing every plane of space. At each node in every net, there is a multifaceted jewel that reflects every other jewel in the net. There is nothing outside the net and nothing that does not reverberate its presence throughout the net.\nFrom an ecological perspective, this metaphor makes obvious sense: ecological systems are exactly such complex sets of relations shaping and being shaped over time by the members of the system. You do not have to study ecological science to understand this; you can easily observe cause and effect in whatever system is close at hand\u2014your family, your workplace, your backyard. You develop systems-thinking through looking at patterns in time and space, such as seasonal cycles or animal paths. For an ecologist, this way of looking is an essential tool. For a mindful citizen, pattern- or systems-thinking can help you raise useful questions in addressing environmental concerns. You can ask about the history of the conflict, the pattern of policy decisions, the economic and social needs of those involved, and the ecological relations at stake.\nAstute observers of systems can decipher the patterns of feedback that reflect the dominant shaping forces. Too much heat, the cat seeks shade. Too much cold, the cat finds a warm car hood to sleep on. Systems are shaped by self-regulating mechanisms, such as those that keep your body temperature constant, and by self-organizing patterns that allow the system to adapt when new opportunities arise. Self-regulating (which maintains the stability of the system) and self-organizing (which allows the system to evolve or \u201clearn\u201d) are both happening all the time at all levels of activity. You can practice observing this in your own body\/mind to see how such feedback works. How do you respond to rainy days? To sunny days? To being hungry? To eating too much? To getting enough sleep? To not getting enough sleep? You can reflect on which places nourish you and why. This is all good practice for developing a systems mind.\nSo far I\u2019m talking about fairly straightforward bio-geophysical reality. But the law of interdependence also includes the role of human thought and mental conditioning. In Buddhist philosophy, intention and mental attitudes count; what people think about the environment has a major effect on what they choose to do. The Buddhist systems-thinker involved in environmental controversy would ask as much about the human actors and their attitudes as about the affected trees and wildlife.\nThis leads to a key aspect of systems thinking, agency, or who is actually doing what? This means determining who is responsible for decisions or actions that impact the planet and the human community. It means tracing the chain of cause and effect back to those who have generated the environmental damage and are in a position to change their course of action. The real world of Indra\u2019s Net is not made up of equal players. Some agents definitely carry more weight than others, as is painfully obvious with the current U.S. administration. Identifying key actors and policy decisions is vital to choosing strategies that can re-orient the system to healthy goals.\nLiberty Hyde Bailey, an American naturalist at the turn of the century, said, \u201cThe happiest life has the greatest number of points of contact with the world, and it has the deepest feeling and sympathy with everything that is.\u201d He was describing the experience of a soulful systems-thinker, one who brings awareness to everyday relations with all beings. A Buddhist might sense this as a deep understanding of the law of interdependence. My point is that such awareness is available to all and is foundational to doing effective environmental work. If you learn the shape of local rivers and mountains, if you meet the people who grow your food, if you help the world become a more livable place, you can begin to see yourself not only as one who is shaped by but also as one who shapes Indra\u2019s Net.\nTaking the Path of Non-Harming\nNon-harming, or ahimsa, is a central principle in Buddhist ethics. This first precept informs all other ethical commitments. Understanding how deeply life is conditioned by suffering, the Buddhist aims not to create further suffering and to reduce suffering wherever possible\u2014in other words, to cause minimal harm. In its deepest sense, ahimsa means the absence of even the urge to kill or harm. Such a compassionate response is said to arise naturally out of a broadly felt connection to other beings.\nThis guideline is not meant to be an impossible ideal but rather a barometer for making choices about how to act. I believe it applies well as a principle for environmental decisions. The U.S. National Environmental Protection Act was written with this intention; environmental impact statements were mandated to measure how much suffering would be caused by a federal project and to suggest mitigation measures to reduce the impact. Reducing suffering might mean changing harvest methods, for example, or it could mean providing protection for species close to extinction.\nThe practice of non-harming is idealized in the Mahayana archetype of the bodhisattva, the enlightened being who returns lifetime after lifetime to help all who are suffering. The bodhisattva\u2019s vow is all-encompassing, requiring endless compassion. Green Buddhists have coined the term \u201cecosattva\u201d to conjure a bodhisattva pledged to ending environmental suffering. Ecosattvas can take their work into any field of environmental concern\u2014agriculture, water pollution, climate stabilization, wilderness protection. The opportunities are endless. Their work carries the strength of the bodhisattva vow to help all who are suffering. Having such a vow as a reference point can relieve our usual anxious pursuit of quick results. Many environmental problems, in fact, are quite intractable and will take lifetimes, maybe even generations, to turn around. A steady intention can provide a grounding point in the midst of what may be a very long battle for environmental stability.\nTwo places where I hear a lot of discussion about reducing harm are in relation to food and energy. The suffering of modern meat production for animals, workers, and the land has been well documented (see Fast Food Nation by Eric Schlosser, or The Omnivore\u2019s Dilemma by Michael Pollan). Likewise, industrial agriculture has been exposed for its chemical assaults on soil and human health. Many people are choosing ethical principles for eating that reduce harm to animals, plants, soils, and the human body. For some, this means eating food produced organically and, if possible, grown by local farmers, thereby decreasing the energy expense of long-distance shipping. For others, this means choosing fair trade products that reduce the toll on field laborers and producers in a competitive global system. Some reduce the lonely anonymity of food shopping by participating in community-supported agriculture food shares.\nI find myself especially concerned about energy choices for the future. My students know that oil production will peak in their lifetimes and that alternative sources of energy must be developed. Biodiesel fuel is quite popular, since it offers a way to recycle used vegetable oil. Wind and solar energy both cause comparatively little harm to the environment, especially compared to coal and oil production. Many people would love to own a hybrid electric vehicle that would allow them to be less dependent on the petroleum economy. While \u201cnon-harming\u201d may not be a key word in this conversation, the direction seems clear: why cause any more harm to the environment? Hasn\u2019t there already been enough? Enough Chernobyl meltdowns and Exxon Valdez oil spills? Getting \u201coff-grid\u201d could be seen as a moral ideal, a way to reduce your ecological footprint and be a better neighbor to the rest of the world.\nGetting to Peace\nIn his new book, Getting to Peace, William Ury, an internationally recognized leader in conflict negotiation, has laid out a number of principles for finding solutions that work to stabilize political conflicts at many levels. It seems to me that his work on \u201cgetting to peace\u201d applies well to environmental issues, which often involve conflict between different parties and different points of view. Some people have said that we are now fighting World War Three\u2014not the war against terrorism, but the assault against the environment. Pesticides, nuclear waste, toxic chemicals, clear-cutting\u2014all these and more are direct attacks on living beings of many kinds.\nIn his book, Ury lays out a role for what he calls \u201cthe third side,\u201d a party outside the immediate conflict but with a vested interest in a peaceful outcome. This suggests a useful role for Buddhists concerned about the environment. The third side party can clarify differences, provide protection to threatened parties, and educate where knowledge is needed. Someone with Buddhist sensibilities can draw on the practices I\u2019ve suggested\u2014being with the suffering, cultivating systems mind, practicing non-harming\u2014and help to stabilize an ongoing conflict. The third side plays an active part, engaging conflict but not taking sides. Ury describes ten specific third-side roles, all of which apply to environmental situations. I\u2019d like to highlight three that seem particularly well suited for a Buddhist approach.\nThe bridge-builder works to prevent conflict by strengthening weak relationships in the human and ecological web. Very often environmental problems arise from user conflicts over a resource or a particular area. Round-table discussions that bring all the parties together can help coordinate and regulate user activities.\nWhere conflicts have escalated and relations are damaged, a Buddhist practitioner might be drawn to the role of healer. A third-side party with a commitment to compassionate action can be a valuable asset in moving a situation forward to resolution. The Buddhist practitioner skilled in relational thinking can analyze the causes and conditions of the conflict and work to heal brokenness and damage. This may take diplomacy, courage, and patience, depending on the degree of the injury. I can imagine bringing this healer role to your own neighborhood if people are angry over bird-hunting cats or chemical spraying. The healer helps conflicting parties understand each others\u2019 positions and find a better solution to the problems at hand.\nWhen environmental conflict has become entrenched and resolution is not in sight, taking a third-side peacekeeping role requires more courage. I think of the massive gold mining operations in Indonesia, for example, where the military is well paid by the mining company to squelch local conflict. The history of assault on the land and people is so deeply ingrained that it will not be easy to resolve. Here a Buddhist practitioner might serve in the role of witness, making the public aware of what is happening to the plants and animals under attack. Bringing attention to the problem exposes harmful behavior, which can then generate public pressure for change. A Buddhist approach is not necessarily more effective than other approaches, but it may add less antagonism to the situation. Rather than further polarizing an already tense situation, the Buddhist can act compassionately toward all parties, bearing witness without accusation, reporting facts without condemnation.\nTo carry out such challenging environmental work, it is crucial to think of yourself as an active agent in Indra\u2019s Net. This is a vitally important part of the peacekeeping effort. Thich Nhat Hanh refers to this as \u201cplanting seeds of joy and peace.\u201d You actively choose to take up environmental work with a clear intention and joyful heart. Sensory contact with the natural world or quiet meditative practices renew the heart and establish an internal reference point of joy that is independent of changing circumstances. With this stabilized intention, the spiritually grounded environmentalist can be prepared for the long haul. In the ancient tradition of gathas, or meditation poems, the late Zen teacher Robert Aitken modeled such intention:\nHearing the crickets at night\nI vow with all beings\nto find my place in the harmony\ncrickets enjoy with the stars.\nIf you recite your own vow of intention, it can be an actual force of renewal in the universe, opening up new possibilities for peaceful relations.\nHis Holiness the Dalai Lama advocates a policy of kindness no matter how troubling the situation. This is practicing Buddhism with a small \u201cb,\u201d taking up the everyday challenge of getting along peacefully with the environment. A policy of kindness toward trees, rivers, sky, and mountains means paying caring attention to all the relations that make up Indra\u2019s Net. As the Dalai Lama says, \u201cWhen we talk about preservation of the environment, it is related to many other things. Ultimately, the decision must come from the human heart. The key point is to have a genuine sense of universal responsibility, based on love and compassion, and clear awareness.\u201d\nEngaging environmental problems is not easy work. But if you work with these Buddhist principles\u2014being with the suffering, cultivating systems thinking, reducing harm, and generating peace\u2014the task seems more possible.\nI haven\u2019t told you whether to get involved with climate protection or waste reduction. I haven\u2019t said whether population or consumption is causing more damage to the earth. There are many fine resources in print and online that take up just these questions. What I hope is that anyone working at any level, as a citizen or professional, as a parent or student, can take up these Buddhist approaches and put them to good use. The Buddha felt the true test of his teachings was whether they were actually helpful in everyday life. Those I\u2019ve offered here are core to my environmental work. I hope they may be of good use to you in whatever piece of the caregiving you take on.","metadata":{"date":1708586455000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947473735.7\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240222061937-20240222091937-00298.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9503845572,"token_count":3818,"url":"https:\/\/www.lionsroar.com\/first-do-no-harm\/"},"score":3,"id":"381"}

{"text":"Regular Inspection and Cleaning\nOne of the most important aspects of maintaining your water heater is regular inspection and cleaning. Over time, sediment, minerals, and other impurities can build up in the tank, reducing its efficiency and lifespan. To prevent this, it is recommended to flush the tank annually to remove any accumulated debris.\nStart by turning off the power supply to the water heater. This can usually be done by switching off the circuit breaker that controls it. Next, locate the drain valve at the bottom of the tank and attach a hose to it. Place the other end of the hose in a drain or outside, away from any vegetation.\nOpen the drain valve and allow the water to flow out, carrying the sediment with it. Be cautious, as the water can be very hot. Once the tank is empty, close the drain valve, remove the hose, and turn on the cold water supply to refill the tank. Finally, switch the power supply back on.\nTemperature and Pressure Relief Valve\nThe temperature and pressure relief (TPR) valve is a safety feature that releases excess pressure in the tank. It is essential to regularly test and replace this valve to ensure its proper functioning.\nTo test the TPR valve, place a bucket under it and lift the valve\u2019s lever. You should hear a rush of hot water into the bucket. If the valve doesn\u2019t release any water or if it leaks continuously, it may be faulty and needs to be replaced.\nWhen replacing the TPR valve, make sure to turn off the power supply and the cold water supply to the tank. Drain some water from the tank to relieve the pressure. Then, remove the old valve by unscrewing it and install the new one according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Once the new valve is in place, turn the power and water supply back on.\nAnode Rod Replacement\nThe anode rod is a sacrificial component inside the water heater tank that attracts corrosive elements and protects the tank from rusting. It is important to check and replace the anode rod regularly to maintain the longevity of your water heater.\nStart by turning off the power supply and the cold water supply to the tank. Locate the anode rod on top of the tank, usually attached to the hot water outlet. Use a ratchet or a wrench to unscrew the anode rod from the tank. In some cases, the rod may be difficult to remove due to corrosion. Apply some penetrating oil to help loosen it.\nOnce the old anode rod is removed, inspect it for signs of corrosion or excessive wear. If the rod is more than 50% depleted, it is recommended to replace it. Install the new anode rod by screwing it into place and make sure it is tightly secured. Finally, turn the power and water supply back on.\nRegular sediment flushing is crucial for maintaining the efficiency of your water heater. Sediment buildup at the bottom of the tank can lead to reduced heating capacity and increased energy consumption.\nTo flush the sediment from your water heater, start by turning off the power supply and cold water supply. Attach a hose to the drain valve at the bottom of the tank and place the other end in a drain or outside, away from vegetation.\nOpen the drain valve and allow the water to flow out until it runs clear, indicating that the sediment has been flushed out. It is recommended to repeat this process every 6-12 months.\nInsulation and Energy Efficiency\nProper insulation can significantly improve the energy efficiency of your water heater. Adding an insulating blanket or jacket to the tank can reduce the heat loss, resulting in lower energy bills.\nBefore insulating, make sure to turn off the power supply and the cold water supply. Measure the dimensions of the tank and purchase an insulating blanket that fits properly. Follow the manufacturer\u2019s instructions for installation, ensuring that the temperature and pressure relief valve and the drain valve remain accessible.\nOnce the blanket is installed, trim any excess material and secure it in place using adhesive or tape. Finally, turn the power and water supply back on.\nIn conclusion, regular maintenance is essential for prolonging the lifespan and efficiency of your water heater. By following these tips and performing periodic inspections and cleaning, you can ensure that your water heater continues to provide hot water reliably and efficiently for years to come.

{"text":"Enduro Training: Economy and Strength\nENDURO IS JUST LIKE TRAIL RIDING... RIGHT?\nWell sort of, except with a bit more structure, clock watching and urgency, and maybe a little less chatting. Essentially though it is about spinning to the top and then bombing back down as fast as possible which is what a lot of us do on the weekends.\nTo really hone your enduro race training regime though, I believe you need to break it down into two sections and concentrate on improving both for an overall improvement in race readiness. I call them Economy and Strength.\nEconomy is about being as efficient and economical as possible on the transitions which are usually dominated by climbs. This will mean that you hit the stage with plenty of gas in the tank and you can put in more effort for race winning times. Nobody wins an enduro on the climbs, but many people lose a race there by being totally wasted by the time they reach the start of the next stage. Economy therefore, is pretty important.\nStrength is about being robust enough, strong enough and powerful enough to fully commit to the rigours of the stages which are often basically DH tracks, just on smaller bikes. To hit this terrain hard, fast and committed 5 times in a day requires full body strength.\nThis is arguably the easiest of the two parts to train. Ideally you want to be able to make the transitions at as low a heart rate as possible, therefore expending less energy and feeling less fatigued.\nThere are not too many short cuts to increased economy and the best way to improve it for most people is longer, steady paced rides at quite low intensities throughout the winter. This can be done on a road bike or MTB, and the focus should be on gradually increasing the durations of your rides and keeping in Zone 1 or 2 for HR or power. Typically a round of the UK Gravity Enduro series sees you riding 30-40 km on the Sunday and climbing about 1500m. You should aim to exceed that in your training so you know that you are capable to doing the loop comfortably.\nTo make yourself more efficient with the use of your body\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stored glycogen (carbs stored in your body) you can practice riding in a fasted state or with little or no carbohydrate ingested prior to riding. (At your own risk - beware of bonking!) This will have the effect of training your body to run on fat as a preferred source of fuel at low riding intensities, saving your glycogen stores for when you need it on explosive stages and improving your energy economy on the climbs.\nYou will obviously need to spend time climbing hills in your training as well. Vary the speeds of your climbs in training, trying to do some hill repeats at high intensities, some at roughly race transition pace and some in Zone 1 or 2. Make sure that some of this training is done on your race bike and not all just on a road bike as you will need to look at your setup. If you have a slack seat tube angle then you may want to put your saddle forwards on the rails to improve your seated climbing position for instance. Race day is not the time to mess around with this stuff, so experiment now and get your setup dialled-in. You may also want to think about how you are going to carry your kit and water. Systems like the new Specialized SWAT give you plenty of versatile options that may mean you can ditch the pack on shorter races, making you lighter and therefore more economical.\nFinally, you will need to look at your power to weight ratio which is crucial for climbing. To improve it you can clean up your diet and lower your body-fat making you lighter or improve your pedal power through strength training. Preferably you will do both. Reducing body-fat is a whole new article, but focus on eating real food and cutting down on sugar and junk. Strength training should focus on whole body exercises like the squat and deadlift performed with perfect form under heavy loads, but we will talk more about this in the Strength section of this article. If you are new to this type of training then I would suggest hiring a good quality coach to help you out. These are not easy exercises to learn from books or the internet!\nFor most riders, strength is the missing part of the training jigsaw. If you are weak, you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t reach your true potential, no matter how skillful or natural on a bike you are. You should look to build whole body strength through the winter months, add in power training in the spring and then work to maintain your gains over the race season or summer. Modern enduro tracks and trail centre descents can be pretty demanding to hit at speed, so it is important to be physically prepared for the hits and to be able to move the bike around easily.\nAs mentioned earlier the key here is to work your entire body, using what are known as \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccompound lifts.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 These are whole body moves and the exact opposite to isolation exercises and machine based training which tend to focus on only one or a few muscles. When you plan your training, you should try and do 2 or 3 whole body sessions per week to build strength through the winter. Never split your training into leg day, chest and tricep day etc. You are not a body-builder!\nThis training does not have to be over complicated. In fact, simple is usually best. If in doubt try and cover all of the following types of movement each week. Examples shown for each to give you some ideas.\nSquat - Bodyweight, single leg, goblet, front, back, overhead.\nHinge - Deadlift, swing, Romanian deadlift.\nPush - Press up, press.\nPull - Rows, pull ups.\nCore - Plank, ab-wheel.\nYou may also benefit from things like loaded carries (carrying heavy stuff) and also some conditioning sessions to build your work capacity and prepare you for intense race stages.\nThe most important thing is to do the exercises properly and that may mean under supervision to get you started. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t rush and don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t let your ego take over when you are selecting what weight to use. Long term consistency in training always trumps short term intensity. To support your strength training, make sure you are doing mobility work and stretching and that will help to keep you moving freely and injury free.\nBy bringing all of this together you can build your own training programme for enduro racing that will address all physical parts of the race. Now you just need some amazing skills on your bike and you will be on the path to victory!\nCONTRIBUTED BY BEN PLENGE\nBen Plenge is a strength coach and mountain biker based in Bristol.

{"text":"According to the 2021 Data Breach Investigations Report from Verizon, 61 percent of all small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) have reported at least one cyber attack during the previous year. Regardless of this, many businesses still do not have any coverage against cyber attacks.\nExecutive SummaryAccording to data from Fundera, cyber attacks target 43 percent of small businesses, an increase from 18 percent just a few years ago, but some companies are still hesitant about getting cyber insurance because they are afraid of putting a target on their back. Steve Prymas, chief insurance officer at Embroker, breaks down the myth that owning cyber insurance increases the risk of facing a cyber attack.\nBusinesses are concerned that having cyber insurance policies in place increases the chances that cyber criminals will identify them as a potential target for future attacks, when in fact, cyber insurance can save a company from going under.\nEven if you don\u2019t have cyber insurance and you are subject to a ransomware attack, cyber criminals likely can find out what assets you do have\u2014bank account information, real estate holdings, investments, etc.\nGiven this information, the attackers will determine your No. 1 financial vulnerability and how much you can feasibly pay and use that to maximize the payment.

{"text":"Maria Burton Carson is most known for being the adoptive daughter of Elizabeth Taylor, the late actress and glamour queen. Maria Burton Carson is a philanthropist as well as a dress designer.\nMaria Burton Carson was born in Germany on August 1, 1961. Her zodiac sign is Leo, and she is 60 years old. When Maria was three years old, her mother Elizabeth Taylor and father Richard Burton adopted her from Munich. Elizabeth married Richard for the fifth time. Unfortunately, there is no information on Maria\u2019s parents. She also has a total of seven siblings. Liza Todd, Kate Burton, Jessica Burton, Michael Wilding Jr., Christopher Edward Wilding, and Barbie Claus Disney Rockefeller are her siblings\u2019 names.\nMaria was also discovered as a newborn with a deformed hip. She had a series of 22 procedures to fix congenital abnormalities in her hips later on. She did, however, become well-known as the daughter of two of the most famous performers of the day. Elizabeth and Richard had frequent quarrels, but they always looked after their daughter, even while they were separated.\nMaria is now employed as a garment designer and philanthropist. However, nothing about her professional background is provided. However, when it comes to her mother\u2019s profession, Elizabeth Taylor was a British-American actress. As a result, she began her acting career as a kid in the early 1940s. In the 1950s, she was one of the most popular stars in classic Hollywood films. In the 1960s, she was also the highest-paid movie actress.\nThis actress is still remembered as one of the most famous ladies in the world. This actress is known for her unrelenting compassion, unyielding strength, and unwavering independence. Her most important position was that of an activist from the mid-1980s till her death. Similarly, when it comes to her father\u2019s profession, Richard Burton was a Welsh actor. The mellifluous baritone voice of this performer was well-known.\nIn addition, in the 1950s, he established himself as a great Shakespearean actor. Then, in 1964, he delivered a stunning Hamlet performance. Nonetheless, this actor is largely recognized as one of his generation\u2019s most respected performers. He was also nominated seven times for an Academy Award, although he never won one.\nMaria had been divorced for a long time. She is now residing in Idaho and is quite low-key. As a result, she has been married twice throughout her life. Daniel Steve Carson was her first husband, and Tom McKeown was her second. They married in a private ceremony in New York City on February 13, 1981. They have one child together, Elizabeth Carson, who was born in 1982. They divorced in the year 2000, when Steve publicly accused her mother-in-law Tayor for tearing his family apart with her influence.\nSteve even filed a lawsuit against Maria after she covertly stole his daughter from him in New York to Elizabeth\u2019s house in Los Angeles. He also claimed that $7,500 from their joint account had gone stolen. Elizabeth then lived with her grandma until she graduated from high school. As a result, she got the opportunity to spend time with Elizabeth Taylor. In 2001, she married Tom McKeown, her second husband. And they had a son, Richard, who was named after his maternal grandpa. However, like her last marriage, the two had a tumultuous relationship.\nAfter verbally harassing and physically assaulting Maria and Richard, Tom was placed under a restraining order. Despite the fact that he claimed the accusations were baseless and that Maria was the one who had failed to be a decent mother, she had the full backing of her mother and friends.\nHer bodily measurements aren\u2019t included in the material. She does, however, have a beautiful and healthy body form. Regrettably, her bodily measurements are still unknown to the reader. She does, however, have brown hair and brown eyes.\nSocial Media and Net Worth\nThis celebrity isn\u2019t on any social media platforms. As a result, she maintains a low-key lifestyle and avoids the public eye.\nWhen it comes to her net worth and earnings, she is undeniably wealthy. However, the exact quantity is yet unclear. She is currently enjoying a life apart from the entertainment industry.","metadata":{"date":1708645143000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947473871.23\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240222225655-20240223015655-00799.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9905328155,"token_count":891,"url":"https:\/\/biographybirthday.com\/maria-burton-carson\/"},"score":2,"id":"386"}

The Holocaust was a watershed event in relatively recent history whose legacies still shape our world and whose lessons are relevant to the challenges we face today.\nThe 2010 Education for All Global Monitoring Report revealed that the history taught at both primary and secondary levels propagated a version of the past based largely on colonial stereotypes and interpretations of Rwandan history, which supported the political ideology during that period and established fertile ground for conflict and genocide. What is taught to students has a lifelong impact on them and determines, to a large extent, their perception of life and their future decisions. This is precisely what informed the introduction of integrated genocide ideology studies so that a new generation of \u2018clean minds\u2019 is molded in the quest for a genocide ideology-free Rwanda.\nThe second day of the Aegis Trust\u2019s three-day Peace Education colloquium began with a panel on different tools to deliver peace education content in Rwanda.

{"text":"Cloud robotics brings the power of cloud computing to management of industrial automation, particularly machine tending. This technology is evolving along with IoT and AI, and Tend.ai is working with major collaborative robot vendors.\nCloud robotics is an area that is quickly evolving. As the underlying technology matures, commercial applications for cloud robotics are now coming to market and simplifying the task of managing a fleet of robots on the manufacturing floor.\nLet\u2019s take a closer look at cloud robotics, including the offerings of new vendor in this space, Tend.ai.[note style=\u201dsuccess\u201d show_icon=\u201dfalse\u201d]\n- Tend.ai, a human-machine interface innovator, is using the cloud to enable operators to remotely monitor and operate robotic systems.\n- Tend is also lowering the knowledge bar and the costs associated with learning how to set up various robots. A unified programming language and command-and-control interface simplify the management of an automated workforce.\n- Cloud robotics is now a safe way to share data from the manufacturing floor.\nDefining cloud robotics\n\u201cCloud robotics and automation systems can be broadly defined as any robot or automation system that relies on data or code from a network to support its operation, i.e., where not all sensing, computation, and memory is integrated into a single standalone system,\u201d according to Ken Goldberg, robotics professor at the University of California, Berkeley.\nOne characteristic of cloud robotics is that data travels bi-directionally between a remote user and a local system via the Internet. This functionality enables the user to remotely tele-operate the device, be instantly alerted to error conditions, and recover the system without having to be physically present.\nThe decisions made by a cloud robotics system can also be enhanced by the processing power inherent in the cloud. The cloud provides virtually unlimited data-storage capability. This big data in turn enables the components operating locally on the robot to be less expensive.\nKen Goldberg and Joseph Santarromana were the first people to connect a robot to the Internet, allowing remote users to interact with the machine. In their famous \u201cTeleGarden\u201d experiment in 1995, Internet users could log into the robot, water their plants, and watch them grow remotely.\nA second key feature of cloud robotics is the ability of networked systems to share data including program updates and process knowledge. With the advent of artificial intelligence to process the collective data, the entire system can benefit from shared improvements.\nSelf-driving cars can be included among cloud-based systems in this context. Autonomous vehicles can use and share a data set of road conditions, live traffic updates, and weather reports to plan safe routes on public roads. This architecture enables the vehicle system to continue to operate locally (within the vehicle) in the case network access is lost.\nProtecting safety and security\nSafety should be paramount for any cloud robotics. Features such as real-time motion control and the handling of emergency stops will always require some element of local processing and I\/O. Sharing information such as production data, 3D shape data, images, and other large data sets is perfect for a cloud-based architecture.\nOn the manufacturing floor or in warehouses, any cloud robotics solution will have to be designed so that low-level functions of real-time control will be delegated to the robot controller.\nMeanwhile, mid-level processing functions such as sequencing can be delegated to local supervisory systems. High-level functions like statistical process control (SPC), reporting, and error handling can be pushed to the cloud for consolidation across the entire production plant.\nNetwork security is also key to any cloud robotics. Any architecture must prevent unwanted access to the data crossing the Internet while also controlling access to to prevent malevolent activities with the robot system.\nThe good news is that the evolution of network security in the IT space over the past 10 years has set the standard. There are now protocols and standards to provide security on the manufacturing floor that\u2019s on par with that of corporate IT systems.\nAI provides processing horsepower\nToday, machine learning algorithms require the processing horsepower of the cloud to effectively process the large data sets generated by multiple mobile sensors in robots. Software is rapidly evolving, and AI is beginning to learn and reason in ways that only humans could do so in the past.\nAI will continue to be a part of the cloud robotics story and architecture as this market evolves. Note, however, that many marketing departments are hyping simple supervisory controls on their machines as AI. It\u2019s just not possible to run sophisticated algorithms on the processors commonly used in robot controllers today.\nConvergence and IIoT\nSeveral technological and market trends are converging, enabling cloud robotics to spread. The first one is the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), which is evolving quickly as standards emerge for network access to every type of controller, sensor, camera and intelligent device on the manufacturing floor.\nThe goal with IIoT is to develop protocols by which devices can be connected to the network, remain secure, and share data with any other device on the network. The idea of a completely connected manufacturing plant has been a dream of production managers for a long time.\nWhere IIoT looks to the implementation of device-to-device communication, Industry 4.0 is an approach to higher-level processes on the manufacturing floor. What IIoT does for devices, Industry 4.0 does for production supervisors.\nTend.ai combines the cloud and cobots\nTend.ai has brought to market one of the first innovations in leveraging the cloud to connect factory automation. As the company name implies, Tend is initially focusing on improving machine tending, which is now being automated though the application of collaborative robots.\nCobots are designed to operate safely next to humans without the need for expensive and constraining safety precautions. Cobots are also designed to be quickly reprogrammed, operated, and redeployed on the manufacturing floor as needed.\nTend.ai\u2019s Sidekick combines several state-of-the-art technologies in a unit next to each cobot that it supervises. Sidekick talks directly to the robot controller inside the local network and then effectively operates as a secure gateway to the cloud on the public side of the network.\nThis architecture ensures that information flowing to and from the cloud is encrypted, preventing any unauthorized access to the local robot. Each Sidekick runs program code designed to talk to the specific robot vendor with which it is partnered.\nTend\u2019s virtual machine operator\nIn addition, an inexpensive camera can connect the cobot and Sidekick. This allows the Tend system to use human-machine interfaces (HMI) on machine tools.\nWith this capability, a Tend-enabled robot can view an HMI and press buttons on the process tool as a human operator would. This functionality can be used to initiate or stop a process, all without the need for local human interaction.\nFurthermore, the Tend system can take the information seen on the process machine HMI and remotely alert an operator on his or her phone or tablet through the cloud. The operator can then instruct the robot how to recover from the situation without having to be near the machine. Or, the robot can be programmed to respond automatically.[note style=\u201dsuccess\u201d show_icon=\u201dtrue\u201d]\nMore on Tend.ai:\nTend will be discussing its offerings at some upcoming events:\n- PTC LiveWorx 2017, May 22-25, 2017, Boston\n- RoboBusiness 2017, Sept. 27-28, 2017, Santa Clara, Calif.\nThe universal language of robots\nMost significantly, operators can quickly and easily train Tend-enabled robots via a phone or tablet. The Tend programming interface simplifies the management of various systems because the operator doesn\u2019t need to understand the unique programming characteristics of each robot.\nCloud robot applications\nMachine tending is the natural and initial application for Tend.ai\u2019s products. This includes loading and unloading of CNC tools or 3D printers.\nIn addition, cloud robotics can enable cobots to make visual inspections for quality control. With the use of a camera attached to the cobot, Tend\u2019s system can move the camera to inspect an assembly or completed component and then make a decision based on that information.\nCloud processing expands the capabilities of collaborative robots and simplifies remote operations. Tend.ai\u2019s systems can work with industrial automation from market leaders such as FANUC, Rethink Robotics, and Universal Robots. The company said its product roadmap will extend to other robot manufacturers over time.\n[note style=\u201dsuccess\u201d show_icon=\u201dtrue\u201d]\nMore on Cloud Robotics and Manufacturing:\n- Five Autonomous Systems Takeaways From Xponential Day 1\n- Mobile Robots, Cobots Steal the Show at Automate, ProMat 2017\n- Human-Robot Interfaces Should Be Subject to Legal Protection\n- Five Facts From 2016\u2019s Top Robotics Conference Every Business Must Know\n- Cloud Robotics Will Lead to General-Purpose Robots, Says Toyota\u2019s Kuffner\n- Home Hunting for Collaborative Bots: Farm, Cloud, or Back Office?\n- Arise Rapyuta: Cloud Engine for Robots Goes Live\n- Is IBM Leading the Next (Virtual) Step in Cloud Robotics?\n- The Age of Cloud Robotics Approaches\nFrom dreams to reality\nCloud robotics is quickly moving from being a buzzword to being part of real-life applications.

{"text":"How Kinesiologists Contribute to Successful Rehabilitation\nKinesiologists contribute to successful rehabilitation in many ways. We are gaining more recognition for our important contributions to helping people with chronic medical conditions, disabilities or musculoskeletal injuries, stay active for life.\nWorking towards achieving the strength and movement you once possessed can be challenging. Since our bodies work as kinetic chains, injury or damage to one aspect throws it off as a whole.\nKinesiologists assess how each injury has changed the way your body moves. By using exercises that incorporate your particular body considerations, we guide you with specific exercises, stretches, movement re-education and lifestyle modifications to get your entire body fit again.\nWhat is Active Rehabilitation?\nRecovery from injury can be a long process that requires a team of health and medical professionals to work together to give you an efficient and effective recovery plan. Exercise rehabilitation enables you to understand the difference between discomfort and pain while learning to challenge yourself.\nOnce the injured area has healed from the initial trauma or surgery, it is time to build strength, flexibility and endurance. Everything in our body is connected and injury to one area affects movement in other areas in our body.\nWho Can Participate in Exercise Therapy Rehabilitation?\nAnyone can participate! The great thing about getting moving again through exercise is that the routine created for you is directly suited to your needs. No matter if you are coming back from a shoulder injury, recovering from a car accident, or managing a chronic medical condition such as Parkinson's or osteoarthritis, exercise programs are designed specifically to help you regain as much function as possible.\nWhy Follow an Exercise Rehab Program?\nThe point of exercise rehab is for you to regain function. Working the body as a whole is an important step in the rehab process, which will get you back to work or sports, and prevent further movement compensations. By strengthening the injured area as well as the entire body, you increase the ability of the area affected by your previous injury and prevent new injuries from occurring.\nTake on New Habits\nIf you didn't exercise before, this could be a great opportunity to get into an exercise regime. It is also time to learn new exercises to improve your lifestyle and quality of life.\nFeel Good About the Way You Move Again\nNothing beats the satisfaction of coming back from an injury and being able to enjoy the activities that you once loved to do. Exercise Rehab can get you to this point efficiently and safely\nA Kinesiologist's Tips for Successful Rehabilitation\nFind someone to exercise with or motivate you.\nSince exercise is a vital part of the rehab process, it is important that you complete the regime you have been given, as well as completing the exercises correctly so that you don't further injure yourself. If you need some motivation, bring along a friend or find someone who has similar limitations as yourself to work through the exercises together. Being active with a friend will make your rehab process more enjoyable.\nDon't Push too Soon or Too Fast\nRemember the main point in partaking in an exercise rehab routine is to get better. By doing too much too fast, you can set yourself back in terms of achieving full recovery. More is not always better. Listen to your body and learn how to distinguish between \"pain\" and \"discomfort.\" Work at your own pace and only move to the next stage of your rehab program when you are ready\nHire a Kinesiologist to Guide You\nKinesiologists have the experience and education to guide back to your previous activities in a safe, effective and efficient way so that your rehabilitation is successful.\nKinesiologists communicate with the other health professionals involved in your care.

{"text":"Afghanistan\u2019s economy is \u201cshaped by fragility and aid dependence\u201d.\nThat is the troubling overview set out by the World Bank several months before the Taliban takeover.\nEconomic prospects look even more precarious now, as future financial assistance is under a cloud of uncertainty.\nAfghanistan does have substantial mineral resources, but the political situation has impeded their exploitation.\nThe aid dependency is striking. In 2019, World Bank figures show development aid was equivalent to 22% of gross national income (which is not the same as GDP, but close to it).\nThat is a high figure, but it is down a long way from the 49% the World Bank reported 10 years earlier.\nNow those aid flows are under a cloud of profound uncertainty. German Foreign Minister Heike Maas told the broadcaster ZDF last week: \u201cWe will not give another cent if the Taliban takes over the country and introduces Sharia law.\u201d\nOther aid donors are sure to be watching developments closely.\nThe fragility the World Bank refers to is illustrated by the very high levels of spending on security before the Taliban takeover: 29% of GDP, compared with an average of 3% for low-income countries.\nSecurity and severe problems with corruption are behind another persistent problem in Afghanistan: very weak foreign business investment.\nAccording to United Nations data, there were no announcements in the last two years of new \u201cgreenfield\u201d investments, which involve a foreign business setting up an operation from scratch. Since 2014, there have been a total of four.\nTo take two other countries from the South Asia region, both with somewhat smaller populations, Nepal has managed 10 times as many and Sri Lanka 50 times more over the same period.\nThe World Bank describes Afghanistan\u2019s private sector as narrow. Employment is concentrated in low-productivity agriculture: 60% of households get some income from farming.\nThe country also has a large illicit economy. There is illegal mining and, of course, opium production and related activities such as smuggling. The drugs trade has been an important source of revenue for the Taliban.\nAll that said, the Afghan economy has grown since the US invasion in 2001.\nThe figures for Afghanistan are not reliable, but what they show, according to the World Bank, is average annual growth of more than 9% in the 10 years from 2003.\nAfter that, it slowed (which may well reflect the lower levels of aid) to an average rate of 2.5% between 2015 and 2020.\nThe country does have significant natural resources, which would, in the context of better security and less corruption, be attractive to international business.\nThere are several types of mineral available in substantial quantities, including copper, cobalt, coal and iron ore. There is also oil and gas and precious stones.\nOne with particularly striking potential is lithium, a metal that is used in batteries for mobile devices and electric cars. The latter application is going to be especially important as the motor industry makes the transition to zero-carbon forms of transport.\nBack in 2010, a top US general told the New York Times that Afghanistan\u2019s mineral potential was \u201cstunning\u201d \u2013 with \u201ca lot of ifs, of course\u201d.\nThe paper also reported that an internal US Defence Department memo had said the country could become \u201cthe Saudi Arabia of lithium\u201d.\nYet this undoubted potential is nowhere near being exploited \u2013 and the Afghan people have seen very little, if any, benefit from it.\nThere have been many reports that China is keen to be involved. It seems to have better relations with the Taliban than Western powers do, so may have an advantage if the new regime does hold on to power.\nHowever, Chinese firms did win contracts to develop operations in copper and oil. But little happened.\nIt is to be expected that China would be interested. The opportunities appear to be very substantial and the two countries do share a short border.\nBut any Chinese agency \u2013 official or a business \u2013 would want to be confident of succeeding. They will be reluctant to commit unless they feel the security and corruption problems will be well enough contained to enable them to extract worthwhile quantities of these industrial commodities.\nA key question for any hard-nosed potential investors \u2013 from China or anywhere else \u2013 will be whether the Taliban is likely to be any more able than the previous Afghan government to create the kind of environment they need.\nAnother factor likely to affect the economy is women\u2019s employment. In the past decade the percentage of the female population over 15 years of age in employment has risen dramatically, though at 22% in 2019 it was still low by international standards. Under the Taliban the change is likely to be reversed, further damaging economic prospects.\nIn the immediate future, there is also a great deal of uncertainty about financial stability. Crowds of people have been trying to withdraw their money from the banks.\nThe Pakistan-based Afghan Islamic Press reported a Taliban spokesman as offering assurances to bank owners, money changers, traders and shopkeepers that their lives and property would be protected.\nThat there are even questions about the physical safety of financial operators is shocking. They do need to be confident if Afghanistan\u2019s financial system is to function. But it also needs customers to feel their money is safe. That won\u2019t happen quickly.","metadata":{"date":1708744548000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947474482.98\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240224012912-20240224042912-00599.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9641728997,"token_count":1097,"url":"https:\/\/blog.q-tickets.com\/2021\/08\/17\/what-next-for-afghanistans-economy\/"},"score":3,"id":"393"}

{"text":"The Why Of Hci\nHelping businesses solve problems and make well informed decisions has been my job for the better part of the last decade. While I find this ultimately enjoyable, there still remains quite a bit of misinformation in the field: just a few months ago a customer informed me that \u201cvirtualization just isn\u2019t ready for production environments.\u201d \u2013 this, after almost 20 years of x86 virtualization!\nHearing comments like this made me want to help dispel some of the FUD out there, clear the fog of war and get things straight. So let\u2019s start with a technology du jour: Hyperconverged Infrastructure.\nHyperconverged Infrastructure, or HCI as it is commonly known today, is the collapse and consolidation of traditional storage architecture into x86 compute architecture. Plainly put: traditional storage architecture is a boxcar attached by couplings to a locomotive engine. SAN\/NAS architecture has historically been coupled by transport mechanism (Fibre Channel, FCoE, IP networks, etc). HCI is a cargo plane, engines attached to the same fuselage that provides the storage.\nPlanes, Trains and Automobiles! \u2026and boats I guess. But boats are jerks.\nWhy give this example? Well with a train, I can add more engines (compute) without adding more boxcars (storage) or vice versa. I can scale these two domains independently of one another, within reasonable consideration of workload. With a cargo plane, if I need more space for shipping, or I need to get things moved faster, I simply buy a new plane. Now I can buy a plane with similar storage and larger engines, or the opposite is true as well. This can be good, bad, or otherwise, depending on your business application and needs.\nNice beard, Goliath! How about a little off the top?\nMuch like the \u201cvirtualization isn\u2019t ready\u201d comment above, I have heard all throughout my career that HCI isn\u2019t ready for lift-off, even though HCI sprouted its first wings more than a decade ago. Common misconceptions abounded, from \u201clinear scale\/growth isn\u2019t how data centers grow\u201d to \u201cthe technology is too immature\u201d or \u201cwhy trust a startup vendor?\u201d Now in the past year, major vendors made some radical marketing pushes, and the gloves have come off \u2013 igniting more than a few David and Goliath battles in the HCI space between strong incumbents and newcomers alike.\nAutomation and Orchestration, DevOps, Continuous Development and Continuous Integration (CI\/CD), and private\/hybrid cloud efforts have all created opportunity to help IT move as quickly as the business demands. This is commonly referred to as \u201cat the speed of business,\u201d but I\u2019ve consulted for enough businesses to know that this speed is quite variable indeed!\nAs \u201csoftware defined\u201d becomes more and more the focus of IT, and not the hardware underlay itself, the HCI model becomes increasingly more compelling. The ability to deliver infrastructure capacity as a commodity (Compute hardware, Storage capacity, and in some cases a pre-installed\/pre-configured hypervisor of choice) and \u201cplug and play\u201d is beating out traditional three tiered architectures simply by merit of design. HCI is designed by nature to be node-based architecture that grows compute and storage by some degree with every node.\nJust like the panda said \u2013 why? Why HCI? Think about these choices from a business perspective for a second: traditional three-tiered architecture I need to size, architect and design each separate domain (compute, storage or network) which takes internal expertise or consulting know-how, then I need to cut a Purchase Order (which can take weeks to months, depending on your procurement cycles, management, legal, etc.) Afterwards my delivery lead time can take between weeks to months(!) to receive the new hardware. Next I need to physically rack and configure the hardware, cable (power, network, Out-of-Band management, Fibre, etc.) Now let\u2019s go, right? Wrong! We need to configure OS\u2019s for compute, configure storage arrays \/ LUNs \/ Disk Aggregates \/ Pools, etc. This is all before we even do burn-in testing (for piece of mind) and integration testing to ensure our new infrastructure is healthy before we release it into production.\nHCI by design takes a lot of the guesswork out of the equation. Since storage and compute (don\u2019t forget potentially virtualization) are combined into a SKU-able package, and scale-out by the node, you purchase what amounts to an appliance \u2013 a \u201cblock\u201d of infrastructure. These nodes are all coupled within software, only physically tethered to each other by way of the upstream switches (usually Top of Rack switches).\nSo why do you care? Lifecycle management is made much easier by allowing nodes to be introduced and retired from these environments non-disruptively. I can consume infrastructure capacity on a per-project basis, capitalize the expense, and depreciate the asset easily vs. multiples or portions of arrays, servers, switches etc. Alternately I can monitor my infrastructures expected growth, operationalize the expense back to different business units via a chargeback\/showback mechanism, and move the visibility of IT value up the ladder.\nLead time to delivery on commodity hardware (servers and hard disks) is also much shorter than lead time on enterprise SAN arrays, full racks of disks (DAE\u2019s), etc. So from a project perspective, you are already saving yourself weeks of time just by adopting a rapidly deployable, scale-out model.\nCan we get some light in here?\nLastly the integration of HCI products are normally highly tested before shipping out the door, meaning the amount of risk the business needs to be capable to absorb is minimal. Compare this to the traditional architecture knowledge set needed to architect, design, configure, deploy, manage and maintain\/retire monolithic hardware sets. You might just be enabling an FTE to move from putting out fires daily to learning how to connect to a RESTful API with POSTman, or building their first cloud solution using Terraform and creating something of value for both them and your business.\nA piece of advice I was given a long time ago is this: \u201cIf you are always reacting to events, then you have no time to create, and true value comes from creation.\u201d The more we can move IT forward, create new innovations and enable positive growth, granular control, and the ability to dynamically shift with demand, the more we can win against our competitors in business.","metadata":{"date":1708564215000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947473598.4\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240221234056-20240222024056-00097.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9383924603,"token_count":1406,"url":"http:\/\/vmikeb.com\/The-Why-of-HCI\/"},"score":2,"id":"395"}
{"text":"Getting Started with Polymer Clay - Preparation\nPolymer clay is a soft, dense material made from polyvinyl chloride, more commonly known as \"PVC.\" It can be formed into all kinds of shapes and colorful patterns, and cured in a regular kitchen oven. In jewelry making, it's used as a medium for creating custom beads and pendants.\nHere's what you'll need to get started:\n- package of polymer clay\n- work surface\n- acrylic roller and\/or pasta machine dedicated to polymer clay use\n- a thin blade or non-serrated knife\n- sewing needle or skewer for hole-making\n- kitchen oven or toaster oven and oven thermometer\n- glass baking dish (like a lasagna pan) or metal pan with parchment paper\n- wire or jewelry findings (optional)\n- epoxy glue (optional)\n- waxed paper\n- plastic wrap or plastic zip lock bags for storage\nThere are several popular brands of polymer clay on the market, including Fimo, Sculpey, and Friendly Clay. It's sold in little wrapped brick shapes and is relatively affordable. You can purchase it from online or local jewelry supply or craft shops, and even from many large discount stores.\nBefore you begin working with polymer clay, you'll need a nice smooth working surface. Plastic and wood surfaces may not be perfectly smooth and can be damaged by the clay. Clay can also be \"contaminated\" by wood dust and slivers. Sheet glass or smooth stone (such as marble or granite) are much better choices. In a pinch, create a disposable work surface by taping a large sheet of waxed paper to a table or counter top.\nManual (crank) pasta machines are very popular for polymer clay conditioning and rolling. (We'll discuss these techniques in the next article in this series.) It's important to use your pasta machine only for polymer clay, and not for making food. You wouldn't want PVC getting into your pasta! Simple pasta machines can often be found on eBay, kitchen stores, or if you're lucky, a local thrift store.\nAn acrylic roller is also useful. Normally, you can pick one up where you purchase polymer clay.\nYou'll also need a tool for cutting through the clay. There are lots of possibilities here, and different cutting methods require different types of cutters. If you're just experimenting, feel free to start out with a non-serrated butter knife or similar flatware. (Again, be sure not to use the knife for food after using it on clay.)\nFor better results, look for a very thin, sharp blade. Probably the thinnest, sharpest type available is called a tissue blade. These can be difficult to find, but are sometimes available at scientific supply stores or craft stores. Tissue blades are extremely sharp, and you must be very careful not to cut yourself when using one.\nAnother option is a wallpaper scraper blade, available at most hardware stores. These blades are almost as sharp as tissue blades, and you must also exercise extreme caution when using them. Some of the polymer clay companies also offer their own blades. For example, Sculpey makes a Sculpey blade. (Follow any safety directions provided on the package.)\nA simple sewing needle is good to have on hand for making tiny holes in small beads and pendants. A skewer or similar instrument can be used to make larger holes.\nWhen you're ready to cure, or fire, your polymer clay creations, you'll need a regular kitchen oven or toaster oven. Most artisans recommend using a separate oven thermometer to properly regulate oven temperature. Oven thermometers are usually available at kitchen and drug stores. Unfired clay pieces can be laid directly into a smooth glass baking dish, or into a metal baking dish on a sheet of parchment paper, and placed in the oven.\nOnce the clay has been fired, you may attach metal jewelry findings using epoxy glue. (We'll cover this technique in the next article in the series.) However, most polymer clay beads require no special findings, and pendants can be strung using simple jump rings.\nFinally, it's good to have some waxed paper on hand to cover your clay when you need to take a short break before firing. Plastic wrap or plastic zip-lock bags should be used to store left-over clay.\nThere are many other tools and supplies you can use when working with polymer clay, and this list only scratches the surface. But once you have these basics assembled, you'll be ready to start creating!\nYou may also be interested in:\nAn affordable kit for the beginning polymer clay bead maker. It includes 2 mandrels for hole-making, a roller, cutting blade, and several more implements to help you achieve professional looking results.\nNext in this article series:\nLinks in this article point to websites not associated with BellaOnline.com.

These are endocrine-disrupting chemicals known to interfere with male hormones, leading to a precipitous decline in sexual prowess and energy.\nWhat sets Alpha Tonic apart? Unlike most alternatives, it pinpoints and addresses the novel root cause of men\u2019s deteriorating sexual health and performance. It\u2019s now recognized that one of the culprits behind advanced sexual decline is the presence of these feminizing compounds. With the introduction of the alpha tonic t booster, men now have a weapon that not only shields them from these harmful chemicals but also revitalizes their male reproductive system.\nHarnessing the might of rare and potent nutrients, Alpha Tonic promises a myriad of benefits. By merely incorporating one scoop mixed with water or a drink of your choice, users can expect an elevation in erectile function, endurance, and boosting testosterone levels. As an added bonus, it contributes to fat reduction, specifically targeting areas like the belly and back.\nBut what lends credibility to the Alpha Tonic results is its commitment to purity and safety. Produced exclusively from 100% natural plant extracts, it\u2019s a beacon of authenticity in an industry rife with synthetics. Manufactured in a facility that boasts FDA approval and GMP certification, the product assures quality and safety.\nFor those curious to delve deeper or wishing to make a purchase, the Alpha Tonic official website serves as a comprehensive resource.\nHow Does The Alpha Tonic Work?\nAlpha Tonic champions the cause of reviving diminished male vitality by amplifying testosterone production. It doesn\u2019t merely stand tall as a testosterone booster; it\u2019s a comprehensive solution addressing the multi-faceted challenges the modern man faces due to environmental and dietary pitfalls.\nOver time, as we expose our systems to a less-than-ideal environment and suboptimal eating habits, toxins accumulate. These aren\u2019t just any ordinary toxins; they\u2019re particularly insidious because of their capacity to sabotage male testosterone levels.\nNumerous studies have conclusively linked these detrimental compounds to both a reduced male sex drive and a decline in testosterone levels. The situation worsens when these toxins start enhancing estrogen levels, the primary female sex hormone. Such a process can deceive the male body into thinking it\u2019s awash with female hormones. The repercussions? A slew of concerning side effects ranging from weight gain and overpowering fatigue to the more distressing reduced sex drive, the onset of \u201cman boobs,\u201d and even erectile dysfunction.\nBut the brilliance of Alpha Tonic lies in its ability to not just counteract these challenges but to revitalize and rejuvenate. Beyond testosterone production, Alpha Tonic works by supporting lean muscle growth and ensures healthy bones, which are integral for overall health. By purging toxins and enhancing testosterone levels, Alpha Tonic reinvigorates the body, paving the way for a stronger, healthier, and more vibrant male vitality.\nAlpha Tonic Ingredients And Their Scientifically Proven Benefits\nAlpha Tonic is created with powerful natural ingredients and organic nutrients that not only boost testosterone levels and sexual performance but also improve overall health.\nLet\u2019s read about the Alpha Tonic ingredients and their proven benefits:\nA revered herbal root, Panax Ginseng in Alpha Tonic is renowned for promoting healthy blood flow throughout the body.

{"text":"R.D. Zimmerman had been to northern Africa and the Caribbean, spent lots of time in Russia, and visited Mexico multiple times.\nBut a couple of weeks after returning home to Minneapolis from a visit to Cabo, on the southern tip of Baja California, he developed a persistent cough that landed him in the emergency room with an unexpected diagnosis: hepatitis A.\nBut anecdotal evidence suggests that Zimmerman\u2019s experience is common, says Greg Poland, director of the Mayo Clinic\u2019s Vaccine Research Group in Rochester, Minn. He sees patients every week who come home from trips with illnesses they could have avoided, including hep A, which often comes from consuming contaminated food or water.\n\u201cMost people will tell you they weren\u2019t aware they were going to some place that had a larger risk,\u201d adds Andrew Pekosz, a virologist at Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health. \u201cOr that they hadn\u2019t gotten the vaccine or taken the appropriate antimicrobial drug that would have minimized the risk.\u201d\nRetirement is a popular time to hit the road and see the world, but travelers face new health concerns once they hit their 60s. Because immunity tends to drop over time, symptoms are often more severe and complications become more common as people age, especially if they have heart disease, diabetes or other conditions.\nVaccines also become less effective after about age 65, but because recovery is tougher, immunizations become especially important.\n\u201cFor most of these vaccines, the side effects and adverse effects are minimal compared to the diseases,\u201d Pekosz says. \u201cYou\u2019re better off getting the vaccine.\u201d\nIt\u2019s worth visiting a travel clinic at least two or three months before a trip to find out which vaccines are recommended for where you\u2019re traveling and whether there are any contraindications with medications you might be taking, experts advise. Planning ahead is important because some vaccines, including hep A, involve more than one dose, spaced months apart, and it may take weeks before a shot starts offering protection. Other immunizations require boosters every few years.\n\u201cOnce you book flights and travel, it is a really good opportunity to then say, \u2018Maybe I should go to a couple of websites and see if there is anything I can prepare from a health standpoint,\u2019\u201d Pekosz says.","metadata":{"date":1708912053000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947474649.44\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240225234904-20240226024904-00098.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9662133455,"token_count":500,"url":"http:\/\/health.heraldtribune.com\/2016\/01\/12\/traveling-in-retirement-update-those-vaccines\/"},"score":3,"id":"399"}

{"text":"XR front LED\u2019s identity\nJust thought I\u2019d ask the question\u2026.\nDoes anyone know the individual id\/type of the LED\u2019s contained in the controller end please ?\nEver since early on in my boards life, the front LED\u2019s (the white ones) have been faulty\u2026 they flash randomly, and barely work. What I have noticed is that the middle LED is dimmer than the others and I suspect it\u2019s dragging the others down.\nNow, whether this was due to water ingress I\u2019ll never know\u2026\nI remember not using it in the rain originally but do recall hitting the odd small puddle (since, I have actually ridden in awful conditions just to keep the day streak up lol)\nThe red LED\u2019s are fine\nI did contact FM but as you can imagine, they won\u2019t sell me the LED strip, sending back to the US was not an option because FM would likely say it WAS water ingress and then I\u2019d be liable for a large bill just to fix the LED\u2019s\nSo hence me asking here.\nI would be cautious taking the controller apart (I\u2019ve done it before thinking it was the dreaded ferrite core issue\u2014\u2014 it wasn\u2019t) because of not wanting to run the risk of losing the day streak ;)\nIf I had the parts at the ready I could get a run in early AM and then have a few hours to repair\u2026 ;)\nAny info greatly appreciated if anyone knows\u2026 thanks.\n@puzz360 I don't know exactly the LED for the XR but I've been researching LEDs the past week I can tell you they're 5630 LEDs.\nWorst case there are people that replace their light bars with 3rd party ones so there's a high chance there might be some working LED bars floating around on the market.\n@lia thank you for the reply... Much appreciated.\nIt certainly looks like a 5630. Now I know that refers to it's dimensions...\n(Hope the link is added correctly)\nThis was a good article:\nBased in California too \ud83e\udd14\n@puzz360 5630 does refer to the package size. Im sure there are many different companies that produce them.\nProbably safe to assume FM used just white and not a warm version. I checked the kickstarter to see if there were any clues but didn't see anything.\nCould be worth reflowing it in the meantime. I've had some LEDs on other projects develop cracked solder joints and cause them to get real flickery.\n@lia good shout... Worth a try for sure \ud83d\udc4d\n@Puzz360 These folks likely know the make of original LEDs used as they've gave it a closer study to create their own custom designed LED PCB.\nBut 'cold joints' must be ruled out first as @Lia already addressed.\n@sirgu Nice one\u2026 appreciate the help :)\nI have looked at these before, originally when I looked they were discounted.\nJust a little pricey for my liking, even though it would be great to support a brilliant idea and product.\nThey may be open to telling me what the LED\u2019s are I guess\u2026 maybe a bit cheeky though lol\nI will be stripping the board down for a tyre change soon, so likely I\u2019ll take a closer look at the LED strip then to check for dry\/bad joints\u2026\nMay try and post a picture later so the problem can be visualised for anyone else with a similar issue.\nThanks all again. Great support here :)\n@Puzz360 said :\n... They may be open to telling me what the LED\u2019s are I guess\u2026 maybe a bit cheeky though lol ...\nTrue. Still worth asking!\nEven though it is obvious from their side you are not eager on primarily buying their product .. on a positive note you'll be gladly share with the community where you got the help from. Which in turn expands awareness about them .. and eventually someone will buy their product instead of you. [-golden rule of marketing]\nSo .. aftermarket creators are not always stubborn to keep knowledge to themselves as FM is in any matters.\nHope you sort it out!\nJust an update for this thread.\nI did contact Oak City Shred Solutions, unfortunately I did not get any form of response.\nHolding out has worked though because I got hold of a guy on the UK Onewheel Facebook group who had a spare front LED strip for sale at a good price and was local \u2026 yay.\nNow just to find the time to fit the strip lol.\n@puzz360 That worked out nicely then :)\nNot sure if I'm preaching to the choir but worth sharing the info juuuuuuust in case.\nWhen doing the headlight swap it might be worth making sure that little ferrite ring is secure or outright replacing it with a custom shielded cable like from Bobs Stoke Shop. Save the headache of having to fix that later when it inevitably breaks free and destroys the cable or worse kill the controller like it did to Nate Fordged once.\n@lia thanks Lia,\nAll tips gratefully received and taken on board (no pun intended) ;) no matter how many times it\u2019s mentioned, it may just help someone\u2026.\nI will certainly double check the cable again, but when I took the thing apart to check initially a couple of years ago, I think I depleted worldwide hot glue stocks sticking down the ferrite core after checking the cable lol.\nThis time see the pictures I\u2019ve just taken of the headlight\nRed LED\u2019s ok\u2026 white LED\u2019s have the middle one dim when they light. The outer 2 are obscured by fangs but are lit correctly.\nUnder normal running they randomly flash on and off, more off than on\u2026\nSo, for anyone still interested. I went the hard way. Bought hot air gun for soldering (https:\/\/www.aliexpress.com\/item\/4000525251154.html?spm=a2g0o.order_list.order_list_main.56.54461802pp4gyG) and replaced leds myself (https:\/\/www.aliexpress.com\/item\/32382405158.html?spm=a2g0o.order_list.order_list_main.40.54461802pp4gyG - white variant). Seems like a good fit, front and rear led strips white leds shines about the same intensity.\n@fixlik Great work finding those LEDs. How are they holding up?\n@lia Well, I had one ride since repair and have my XR listed for sale, so I'm afraid I will not be able to report that..\nOK... slight tangent, but still fairly relevant to headlight failure in general.\nWas experiencing flickering and dim white light up front so I opted to open the controller for diagnosis.\nZero signs of water damage (board was badgered before I tore it open), solder joints look \"fine\", and the ferrite ring wasn't pulling the connector bodies off the PCB (but it was squashing the controller side connector). So no smoking gun. Boo...\nSo, before I start replacing things and adding solder willy-nilly, I'd like to test the PCBA in isolation. Does anyone know the pinout and power requirements for the XR headlight circuit off hand?\nI have recently replaced both the led strip and the cable (shielded type). My LEDs are still flickering. :(\nMaybe you have the same issue as me ?\nI'm bummed to hear that. I've got a local shop ready to diagnose\/repair, but I'm starting to contemplate how much it's worth to me.\nI opened the controller for two reasons, to look for a quick fix, and to ensure the ferrite ring wasn't about to fry my controller. My controller is now safe, so I may just close it back up without a headlight and call it a day, the trails are calling.","metadata":{"date":1709254967000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947474893.90\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240229234355-20240301024355-00897.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9539502263,"token_count":1687,"url":"https:\/\/owforum.co.uk\/topic\/230\/xr-front-led-s-identity"},"score":1,"id":"401"}
{"text":"Irony Of It All\nThis worksheet is focused on the concept of verbal irony, where the intended meaning of words is different from their literal interpretation. Students are given a definition of verbal irony and then asked to select one of three scenarios and craft a dialogue that contains an example of verbal irony. The scenarios presented are relatable and prompt students to think creatively about how verbal irony might manifest in those situations: a teen\u2019s college acceptance, a woman\u2019s wedding day, or seeing a stalled car belonging to a famous race car driver.\nThe worksheet is designed to teach students how to write and recognize verbal irony in conversation. It encourages them to consider how people often say the opposite of what they mean for effect, which can add humor or emphasis to their words. By creating their own ironic dialogue, students develop a practical understanding of how verbal irony works and its use in everyday language. This skill helps improve their analytical reading abilities, especially in literature where verbal irony is a common device, and it also enhances their writing by incorporating nuanced expressions of speech.","metadata":{"date":1709318534000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947475422.71\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240301161412-20240301191412-00398.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9498093128,"token_count":215,"url":"https:\/\/15worksheets.com\/worksheet\/irony-12\/"},"score":5,"id":"402"}

{"text":"Air Tahiti Nui is currently in the process of refreshing their fleet. The airline used to exclusively fly five A340-300s, though is retiring those planes in favor of four Boeing 787-9s. Over the course of about a year the airline will be going from an all Airbus to all Boeing fleet (which is an especially interesting move for a French airline).\nAir Tahiti Nui A340-300\nThe 787-9 represents a nice improvement for the airline, as they finally have fully flat beds in business class. Furthermore, from an economic perspective, the 787-9 has much more favorable operating costs.\nAir Tahiti Nui 787-9 business class\nIn theory the 787-9 is also a significantly longer range aircraft than the A340-300.\nFor the most part Air Tahiti Nui doesn\u2019t really need that range, though, as the airline flies:\n- From Papeete to Auckland, Los Angeles, and Tokyo Narita\n- From Los Angeles to Paris\nTheir current longest flight is from Tokyo Narita to Papeete, which at 5,863 miles is well within the range of either aircraft.\nAirways Magazine has an interesting interview with Air Tahiti Nui\u2019s CEO, in which he talks about why the airline chose the 787-9 over other aircraft, including the A350. Here\u2019s his answer:\nAnd for ultra-long-haul, what we needed is range. And the best range comes with the Boeing 787-9.\nThis plane would allow us to fly nonstop from Tahiti to Paris. We would beat the current Singapore \u2013 Newark flight in terms of time and distance. We are really thinking about it. The Los Angeles stop is not really that comfortable for our French passengers.\nSo it\u2019s interesting that he talks about needing the range, because obviously that\u2019s not needed for their current routes.\nThere\u2019s no doubt that there would be big demand for a nonstop Tahiti to Paris flight, as the airline already carries a lot of people between the places. Air France and French Bee also both operate one-stop routes between Paris and Tahiti, through Los Angeles and San Francisco, respectively.\nThere\u2019s also no doubt that the US stop is a pain in the rear for French passengers. This would otherwise be a domestic flight (since Tahiti is a French territory), but all passengers have to clear immigration in the US.\nA nonstop flight from Paris to Tahiti would cover a distance of 9,765 miles.\nFor context, the world\u2019s longest current 787-9 route is Perth to London, which covers a distance of 9,009 miles, while the world\u2019s longest flight is Singapore Airlines\u2019 Singapore to Newark flight, which covers a distance of 9,534 miles and is operated by an A350-900ULR.\nAir Tahiti Nui 787-9\nSo to be honest, I\u2019m really confused:\n- While there would no doubt be dig demand for this route, it\u2019s above the published range of the 787-9\n- At the same time I can\u2019t imagine Air Tahiti Nui spent nearly a billion dollars on a type of plane specifically because of the range it offers, only to find out the plane can\u2019t actually operate the route\nSo yeah, I guess to sum it up\u2026","metadata":{"date":1709062580000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947474686.54\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240227184934-20240227214934-00298.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9469578862,"token_count":716,"url":"https:\/\/onemileatatime.com\/air-tahiti-nui-worlds-longest-flight\/"},"score":2,"id":"404"}

{"text":"Times are tough, but you gotta love the spirit emulated by Teena Wilson, manager of Calgary\u2019s cherished live music venue The Blues Can for the past decade, with her vision of the fundraiser for said venue, which starts online at 6 p.m. May 21 and continues 24 hours daily until at least midnight on Sunday. Accessible via their Facebook page or website, it will feature non-stop music, messages and anecdotes about playing at The Blues Can from musicians both local and abroad, and good vibes no matter what else is going on out there in the world.\n\u201cMy hope sincerely is that everybody brings the festival up on their smart TV with the big speakers, or maybe brings it outside, and enjoys themselves. Maybe they dance and they sing in their safe units that they have and it just gives people a little distraction on a long weekend,\u201d says Wilson, who organized the fundraiser along with Blues Can owner Greg Smith while counting on the tech savvy of longtime soundman Marco Levesque.\nLike many others, the venue is finding ways to hold steady after the bucking bull ride of shut downs and re-openings since March, 2020. While their take out menu is delicious and helps keep possibilities for live music afloat, more was needed. \u201cYou know, we never really stopped. Even during that reopening when we could have music, we did 280 shows in that small time.\n\u201cThis fundraiser came about because we were doing a lot of recordings anyways in the daytime and were showing them at night, and (with the recent restrictions) we couldn\u2019t do that anymore. We started collecting these recordings and accolades and it just evolved into what I thought would be an online festival. Then I started this auction with Elevate Auctions and it kind of took off.\u201d\nThe auction, which closes May 24, features everything from music libraries of esteemed local musicians to guitars to Flames memorabilia to bath products. Heck, there\u2019s even a pair of Chuck and Di wedding plates in there.\nArtists featured via video recordings include Peter and the Wolves, Brother Ray Lemelin Band, Amy Bishop and The Hopeless Sinners, Tim Williams, Tom Phillips and The DTs, Israel\u2019s Sobo Blues Band, Steve Pineo, The Lovebullies and so many more. Wilson hopes to have a schedule put together, but as the team works to get all of the videos into the same format and ready to stream, time is tight.\n\u201cWe are showing every single thing that everybody submitted \u2026 because they went through the trouble to get it to us. Even things recorded on a cell phone.\u201d\nSerendipity intervened when Wilson, despite her trepidations, booked the fundraiser for this weekend. \u201cI was nervous, months ago, when I picked the long weekend and I thought, \u2018Well, it\u2019s usually raining.\u2019 I picked the Friday night on the long weekend and then got so much recording done, and people were so interested in everything it started to grow. Then they (suggested limitations to travel at) the border to BC so you can\u2019t go over there camping for the long weekend.

{"text":"For the last few days, I\u2019ve been trying to articulate the experience we\u2019ve just had.\nIt\u2019s kinda one of those once in a lifetime things where \u2018you just had to be there\u2019 to appreciate the sheer feat of it all.\nI\u2019ve had this dream to ride a motorbike through the Himalayan mountains for the last 7 years and 6 months ago I bit the bullet, booked it and then figured out the how to ride a motorbike part.\nWhilst I only ended up with about 600km of on road bike experience prior to setting off, nothing could have prepared me for the adventure that unfolded thanks to Nomadic Knights.\nTrust me to not read the fine print. Turns out I\u2019d signed Bob Mp and I up to an extreme off-road motorbike adventure (silly me thought \u2018extreme\u2019 was simply referring to the traffic in India \u2013 and I\u2019ve been there done that so thought not much of it)\nDay one mostly tarmac and some gravely bits: quite pleasant and I started to settle in.\nBut by day three, after a 10 hour day of full off-road, gravel, water crossings, hairpin bends, dodging trucks, riding on the cliff edge, I realised I\u2019d made the best freaking mistake of my life.\nFor 14 days straight I had no idea what was coming around each corner (mostly a herd of goats\u2026 and definitely always a pothole that could swallow you whole) but with every kilometre I was physically and mentally challenged far and beyond my own capability and wouldn\u2019t change a thing!\nWe were the complete novices amongst a group of highly experienced riders. I came in last each day, but I definitely wasn\u2019t chasing a podium finish but I can say food tastes better, colours more vibrant after several \u2018brushes with death\u2019 on the road \ud83e\udd23\nYes, I stacked it and ate dirt, 4-5 times that I can remember. I had brushes with traffic that ripped the panniers on my bike \u2013 I limped my trusty steed over the finish line on the last day (actually the support crew did \u2013 I rode their bike as mine had no brakes after a particularly intimate moment I shared with a concrete wall)\nI used to think I loved adventure. But I realised early in this trip that it\u2019s not really about the adventure, but about what being COMPLETELY out of your comfort zone does for your body and mind. It shows you, you are far more capable of what your comfortable life leads you to believe. It re-wires neurons in the brain that create new stories of self \u2013 belief and it helps you put into real perspective the things in life that are (or aren\u2019t) worth your time and energy.\nAfter trekking to Everest Base Camp, this was by far the hardest thing I have ever done in my life (and I paid for the pleasure??! Hahahah). The most physically demanding, requiring unshakeable mental focus for some days 14 hours on the road (remember those trucks, goats and potholes? you can\u2019t switch your brain off for a second)\nThe hardest, but by far the most incredible thing I have done in life so far. Yes it hurt, yes it was cold (and then bloody hot) it was exhausting and most didn\u2019t end with a nice hot shower and soft mattress\u2026 but if you asked me if I\u2019d do it all again, I\u2019m already trying to figure out the dates for another ride next year\u2026\nOf course the photos don\u2019t do it justice, but I\u2019ll share some of them here because I can\u2019t wait for Facebook memes to remind me of the first time I rode with Alex Pirie, Vidhya and his exceptional team \u2013 in years to come!\nIf you don\u2019t go to the nursing home having scared yourself to half death and bitten off more than you can chew\u2026 did you ever really live???\nThakur Ravi Banyal Lovely Sharma Ashraf Khan Ru Ben Andy Matthews Peter Hudec John Blenkin Russell Quilter and the rest of the June 2023 crew.\nRoof Of India","metadata":{"date":1708997463000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947474669.36\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240226225941-20240227015941-00698.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9576811194,"token_count":887,"url":"https:\/\/www.nomadicknights.com\/a-riders-story\/"},"score":1,"id":"410"}

Abbreviated as kwh or KWH. This is the normal quantity used for metering and billing electricity customers. The price for a kwh varies from approximately 4 cents to 15 cents. At a 100% conversion efficiency, one kwh is equivalent to about 4 fluid ounces of gasoline, 3\/16 pound LP, 3 cubic feet natural gas, or 1\/4 pound coal.\nkV - abbreviation for kilovolt and equal to 1000 volts.\nkVA - abbreviation for kilovolt amperes.\nkVAr - abbreviation for kilovar. A unit of ac reactive power equal to 1000 vars.\nkW - abbreviation for kilowatt. A unit of power equal to 1000 watts.\nlisted - an electrical device or material that has been tested by a recognized organization and shown to meet appropriate standards. Many local governmental authorities require that installed electrical products be listed. A well-known listing organization is Underwriters Laboratories (UL).\nload - a device which consumes electrical power and is connected to a source of electricity.\nLRA - Locked rotor amperes. This is the current that a motor would require if the rotor were locked in place and prevented from rotating and rated nameplate voltage and frequency were applied to its terminals. This is also the current that could appear briefly during motor starting. While the motor comes up to speed this current gradually drops off and when the speed approaches running rpm this current rapidly falls to the RLA value. Often the starting current is less than the LRA value because the voltage at the motor terminals dips during starting. This LRA value is important when sizing a generator because the generator's surge rating must be large enough to handle it.\nMCA - Minimum circuit amperes. This is the minimum current rating allowed for the wiring and circuit breaker or fuse protection for the equipment. It is used by the installer and electrician to size the branch circuit to feed the equipment.\nNational Electrical Code - a code for the safeguarding of people and property from hazards related to the use of electricity. Compliance with this code along with proper maintenance will result in an installation essentially free from hazard. Abbreviated NEC. The NEC was first developed in 1897 as a result of the efforts of various insurance, electrical, architectural, and allied interests. It is sponsored and regularly updated by the National Fire Protection Association.\nNEC - abbreviation for the National Electrical Code.\nneutral - a conductor of an electrical system which usually operates with minimal voltage to ground. Depending on the type of system, it may carry little current or only unbalance current. Systems that have one conductor grounded use the neutral for this purpose.\nOhm - a unit of electrical resistance. A circuit resistance of one ohm will pass a current of one ampere with a potential difference of one volt. Abbreviated using the Greek letter omega (W ). Named for the German physicist George Simon Ohm 1854.\nOhms Law - defines the relationship between voltage, resistance, and current. In 1828 the German physicist George Simon Ohm showed by experiment that the current in a conductor is equal to the difference of potential between any two points divided by the resistance between them. This may be written as I = E \/ R where E is the potential difference in volts, R is the resistance in Ohms, and I is the current in amperes.\nopen circuit voltage - the maximum voltage produced by a power source with no load connected.\novercurrent - any current beyond the continuous rated current of the conductor or equipment. This may be value slightly above the rating as in the case of an overload, or may be far above the rating as in the case of a short circuit.\noverload - operation of electrical equipment above its normal full-load rating or of a conductor above its rated ampacity. An overload condition will eventually cause dangerous overheating and damage.\npower - the rate at which work is performed or that energy is transferred. Electric power is commonly measured in watts or kilowatts. A power of 746 watts is equivalent to 1 horsepower.\npower factor - the ratio of real power to apparent power delivered in an ac electrical system or load. Its value is always in the range of 0.0 to 1.0 or 0% to 100%. A unity power factor (1.0) indicates that the current is in phase with the voltage and that reactive power is zero.\nreactive power - the mathematical product of voltage and current consumed by reactive loads. Examples of reactive loads include capacitors and inductors. These types of loads when connected to an ac voltage source will draw current, but since the current is 90o out of phase with the applied voltage they actually consume no real power in the ideal sense.\nreal power - the rate at which work is performed or that energy is transferred. Electric power is commonly measured in watts or kilowatts. The term real power is often used in place of the term power alone to differentiate from reactive power. Also called active power.\nresistance - the characteristic of materials to oppose the flow of electricity in an electric circuit.\nRLA - Running load amperes, also sometimes abbreviated FLA for full load amperes. This is the current in amperes that a motor requires to produce rated nameplate horsepower output when rated nameplate voltage and frequency is provided to it's terminals.\nrms - \"root-mean-square\", a method of computing the effective value of a time-varying electrical wave. For example, an ac current is said to have an effective or rms value of one ampere when it produces heat in a certain resistance at the same average rate as a continuous (or dc) current of one ampere would in the same resistance. rms - \"root-mean-square\", a method of computing the effective value of a time-varying electrical wave. For example, an ac current is said to have an effective or rms value of one ampere when it produces heat in a certain resistance at the same average rate as a continuous (or dc) current of one ampere would in the same resistance. rms - \"root-mean-square\", a method of computing the effective value of a time-varying electrical wave. For example, an ac current is said to have an effective or rms value of one ampere when it produces heat in a certain resistance at the same average rate as a continuous (or dc) current of one ampere would in the same resistance. rms - \"root-mean-square\", a method of computing the effective value of a time-varying electrical wave. For example, an ac current is said to have an effective or rms value of one ampere when it produces heat in a certain resistance at the same average rate as a continuous (or dc) current of one ampere would in the same resistance.\nseparately derived system - an electrical system whose power is provided by a stand-alone generator, transformer, or converter and which has no direct electrical connection or ground connection to another source (such as the utility). The NEC contains special grounding and bonding requirements for such systems.\nservice - the equipment and conductors that transmit electricity from the utility supply system to the building being served.\nservice equipment - the circuit breaker or fused switch located near where the service conductors enter the building which is intended as the primary means of disconnecting the supply.\nshort circuit - a low resistance connection unintentionally made between points of an electrical circuit which may result in current flow far above normal levels.\nsine wave - in ideal electric systems, the characteristic shape of the alternating voltage or current wave. This shape matches the trigonometric sine function of the acute angle in a right triangle and equals the ratio of the side opposite the angle to the hypotenuse.\nsingle-phase - an ac electric system or load consisting of at least one pair of conductors energized by a single alternating voltage. This type of system is simpler than three-phase but has substantial disadvantages when large amounts of power have to be delivered.\nsurge capacity - the ability of an electrical supply to tolerate a momentary current surge or inrush imposed by the starting of motors or the energizing of transformers.\nthree-phase - an ac electric system or load consisting of three conductors energized by alternating voltages that are out of phase by one third of a cycle. This type of system has advantages over single-phase including the ability to deliver greater power using the same ampacity conductors and the fact that it provides a constant power throughout each cycle rather than a pulsating power, as in single-phase. Large power installations are three-phase.\ntransformer - a device that converts one ac voltage and current to a different voltage and current. Constructed using two or more coils of wire around a common magnetic core. The energy is transferred from one coil, usually considered the primary winding, to the other coil, the secondary winding by means of mutual induction in the magnetic core. Transformers are an efficient and economical means of transferring large amounts of ac electric power at high voltages. This is the primary advantage of ac systems over dc systems.\nUnderwriters Laboratories - a non-profit organization that was established by the insurance industry to test electrical devices for safety.\nuninterruptible power supply - a device that provides a constant regulated voltage output in spite of interruptions of the normal power supply. It includes filtering circuits and is usually used to feed computers or related equipment which would otherwise shutdown on brief power interruptions.

Unit of ac reactive power.\nvolt - The electrical potential difference or pressure across a one ohm resistance carrying a current of one ampere. Named after Italian physicist Count Alessandro Volta 1745-1827.\nvolt ampere - a unit of apparent power equal to the mathematical product of a circuit voltage and amperes. Here, apparent power is in contrast to real power. On ac systems the voltage and current will not be in phase if reactive power is being transmitted. Usually abbreviated VA.\nvoltage drop - a voltage reduction due to impedances between the power source and the load. These impedances are due to wiring and transformers and are normally minimized to the extent possible.\nwatt - A unit of power equal to the rate of work represented by a current of one ampere under a pressure of one volt.

{"text":"In the realm of mental health, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) stands out as a dynamic and transformative approach. Rooted in practical techniques, CBT empowers individuals to navigate the complex terrain of their thoughts and emotions. Here, we delve into a range of cognitive behavioral therapy exercises without referencing specific entities or individuals:\nMind mapping is a creative CBT exercise that involves visually organizing thoughts and associations. This technique aids in identifying patterns, connections, and potential cognitive distortions. By visually mapping out the landscape of thoughts, individuals gain insights into the intricate interplay of their mental processes.\nCBT extends its reach into cultivating positive emotions through gratitude journaling. This exercise prompts individuals to regularly note down things they are grateful for. Focusing on positive aspects fosters a shift in perspective, counteracting negativity and contributing to an overall sense of well-being.\nRole reversal is a powerful CBT technique used to challenge and reframe interpersonal conflicts. This exercise involves putting oneself in the shoes of another person involved in the situation. By gaining a different perspective, individuals can understand alternative viewpoints and work towards more constructive communication and resolution.\nEnergy budgeting is a metaphorical CBT exercise that involves managing one\u2019s mental and emotional resources. Individuals identify activities that drain or replenish their energy and create a balance. This exercise encourages mindful allocation of time and energy, contributing to enhanced emotional resilience.\nIncorporating self-compassion into CBT practices, meditation exercises focus on fostering a kind and understanding attitude towards oneself. Individuals practice mindfulness and self-compassion, reducing self-criticism and developing a more nurturing inner dialogue.\nAnchoring Positive Affirmations\nAnchoring positive affirmations involves associating empowering statements with specific cues or actions. This CBT exercise helps individuals create mental triggers for positive self-talk.

{"text":"28 Jun Autism and Nutritional Supplements\nChildren with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) tend to be picky eaters or they may have an aversion to certain foods such as vegetables. Therefore, they may not be getting sufficient amounts of vitamins and minerals. Today, many children with ASD take nutritional supplements and follow specific diets such as a gluten-free and casein-free (GFCF) diet.\nA study just published in the Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics showed that even with supplementation, children with ASD were still deficient in several nutrients such as calcium and vitamin D. On the other hand, some were consuming excessive amounts of vitamin A and other nutrients.\nThree hundred and sixty-eight children, ages 2 \u2013 11 years old, were recruited from five Autism Speaks Autism Treatment Network (AS ATN) locations. A three-day diet diary was completed for each child. Photos of the nutrition supplement labels were taken to accurately document the nutrients obtained from these supplements.more\nAs a result, researchers found that children with ASD consumed similar amounts of micronutrients as children without ASD. They had many of the same deficiencies commonly seen in the pediatric population, including vitamin D, vitamin E, calcium, potassium, and choline. Even though children with ASD are given supplements more often than the general pediatric population, 40-55% were lacking in calcium and 30-40% were lacking in vitamin D.\nChildren with ASD may obtain most of their required nutrients from their diet, however, it is essential to determine the specific nutrient need of each child. The level of nutrient intake that maintains the best possible health is highly variable from person to person. Lifestyle choices and environmental exposures filtered through genetic predisposition are fundamental factors in ASD, and a successful treatment approach must include investigation into these factors. It is important to assess the nutrient status of the child. This can be the antioxidant status, vitamins, essential fatty acids, vitamin D, calcium, etc. Also, it is critical to assess gut health. This includes \u201cleaky gut\u201d and dysbiosis, as many of these children have dysbiosis and opportunistic infections.\nChildren with ASD have significantly different concentrations of certain bacteria in their stool compared to children without ASD. Increasing evidence suggests that children with ASD have altered gut bacteria. It is suspected that gut microbes can alter the levels of neurotransmitter-related metabolites affecting the gut-to-brain communication and alter brain function.\nStress may also play a role in the need for increased nutrient demands. Researchers at the Institute for Autism Research have found that stress levels play a critical part in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Lower-functioning children with ASD (LFASD) had significantly higher levels of salivary cortisol than both high-functioning children with ASD (HFASD) and those children without ASD.\nOptimal nutrition is incredibly important and can be difficult to accomplish for children with Autism Spectrum Disorders. It can be extremely challenging for some parents to get their children to eat a nutrient dense diet. Children are growing, the brain is developing, and there tends to be some nutritional gaps due to lack of variety in their diet, soil deficiencies, or eating processed, convenience foods. Children may be influenced by advertising or packaging and sometimes choose which foods they will eat. A well balanced diet consisting of whole foods should be the number one priority in providing a solid foundation for their health, but supplements can definitely fill in some of the gaps. We have to be realistic\u2026.our diets cannot always meet all of our needs, especially for growing children, which means supplements are necessary from time to time.\nBy Michael Jurgelewicz DC, DACBN, DCBCN","metadata":{"date":1708503257000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947473401.5\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240221070402-20240221100402-00599.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9615852237,"token_count":754,"url":"https:\/\/dradatya.com\/autism-and-nutritional-supplements\/"},"score":4,"id":"414"}
{"text":"Just blogging this in case it hits anyone else.\nI was previously using NextDNS with my internal DNS servers on a couple of Raspberry Pis.

{"text":"There\u2019s good, mixed, and, candidly, bad news about how much climate pollution the United States is contributing to our warming planet. Using new real-time data and independent analyses, we can begin to reveal the key energy and emissions trends from 2019\u2014and what 2020 likely has in store\u2014several months ahead of the official release of U.S. government data.\nHere are some top line findings that emerge:\n- U.S. climate-warming pollution fell modestly in 2019, according to preliminary estimates from the private consultant Rhodium Group.\n- This decline followed a sharp uptick in carbon emissions in 2018, which had been a worrying reversal after years of moderate, but consistent, reductions.\n- Despite an overall reduction in greenhouse gases, it appears that non-CO2 emissions\u2014such as methane, a more potent but shorter living GHG\u2014are rising.\n- The U.S. may generate more power from renewables than coal annually in 2021, for the first time ever.\n- Progress in the power sector has helped bring total climate-warming emissions back on the decline, but the United States is at huge risk of missing international climate targets.\n- To meet the Copenhagen Accord targets, the U.S. needs to cut greenhouse gas pollution by 5.3 percent in 2020\u2014an (almost) unheard of feat.\n- To meet the Paris Accord target, the U.S. needs to reduce emissions about 3 percent annually over the next six years\u2014significantly faster than the 0.9 percent average annual reduction achieved since 2005.\nLet\u2019s dig into what the data shows. Almost all emission reductions came from the power sector, which has been undergoing a relatively swift transition from coal-fired power to cleaner, and cheaper, alternatives like wind and solar energy.\nRhodium estimates that industry and buildings saw carbon pollution rise by 1 to 2 percent in 2019. The transportation sector\u2014the largest contributor to climate change in the U.S.\u2014saw emissions stabilize in 2019, after years of steady growth. And outside of carbon pollution, other greenhouse gas emissions\u2014including those related to agriculture and oil and gas methane\u2014are estimated to have increased by over 4 percent in 2019.\nTo meet our international climate commitments, the U.S. must look beyond the power sector. Serious and aggressive action must be taken at the federal, state, and local levels to improve energy efficiency across the economy, transition to cleaner and electric fuels in buildings and vehicles, and tackle non-carbon greenhouse gases like methane from oil and gas operations and potent climate-warming refrigerants like HFCs.\nThe power sector continues to drive U.S. climate gains\nRhodium Group\u2019s analysis estimates that power sector emissions\u2014from generating and transmitting electricity created from burning coal and natural gas\u2014declined by 10 percent between 2018 and 2019. This is the largest single-year decline in power sector carbon pollution since the federal government started reporting carbon emissions in 1973.\nMore than 60 gigawatts (GW) of coal-fired power capacity retired in the last five years, equal to more than one-fourth of all coal plants operating in the U.S. today. Coal closures in 2019 hit some of the highest levels on record\u2014with about 15 GW (according to NRDC\u2019s tracking) coming offline over the course of the year. Many of the coal plants closing in the last year or two have been larger and newer than those that retired in or before 2015\u2014with retired units almost three times the size and 10 years younger, on average, than earlier retirements.\nUsing U.S. Energy Information Administration\u2019s (EIA) real-time electric grid monitor, NRDC tabulated the continental U.S electric mix for 2019. That shows that coal-fired generation fell by 18 percent year-over-year, hitting the lowest levels in 35 years. This is the largest single-year drop in coal generation ever recorded (e.g. since 1949). In total, coal provided 24 percent of all electricity in 2019; natural gas provided 37 percent; nuclear power 20 percent; renewable resources 17 percent, and the remaining 2 percent came from oil.\nThe U.S. also hit another milestone in 2019: in April, more electricity came from renewables (wind, water, and solar) than from coal for the entire month. This is the first month ever that renewables provided more electricity than coal in the U.S.\nLooking forward, EIA\u2019s new projections estimate that renewables will provide more electricity than coal on an annual basis by 2021. That\u2019s historic progress for clean energy.\nRhodium group estimates that reduced coal generation cut carbon pollution by 190 million metric tons in 2019. Increased natural gas generation, however, added another 40 million metric tons of carbon pollution in 2019, as another 15 GW of gas-fired capacity entered service.\nBased on the EIA\u2019s generator inventory, more than 75 percent of all power capacity expected to begin operations in 2020 will be sun- or wind-powered. The other quarter will be mainly gas-fired, with a handful of battery and hydro-powered additions as well. As a result of these new power plants, non-hydro renewable generation is expected to grow by 15 percent in 2020\u2014the fastest rate in four years.\nAnnual wind and solar installations are also expected to reach record levels in 2020, adding 18.5 GW of wind power (surpassing the record set in 2012 of 13.2 GW and enough to power more than 6.5 million homes every year) and another 13.5 GW of utility-scale solar expected (surpassing the record set in 2016 of 8 GW and enough to power over 2.9 million homes every year).\nAt the same time, closures of older coal, gas, and nuclear plants are expected to continue through the new year. Coal-fired power plants are projected to make up more than half of all closures, mainly in just two states: Kentucky and Ohio. Another third of the closures, according to EIA, will be older gas-fired units, with most of the remainder nuclear powered.\nTransportation still largest source of pollution, but emissions stalled in 2019\nThere was one other silver lining in this year\u2019s report: the transportation sector, which is the largest source of emissions in the U.S., saw emissions decline by 0.3 percent between 2018 and 2019. This comes after years of rising emissions \u2013 and despite Americans driving more last year than they did in 2018. Improved fuel economy of our cars, which means we use less oil per mile driven, played a key role. However, these standards are under threat from the current administration.\nThe rest of the U.S. economy is stalled or moving backwards on climate\u2014largely due to increased gas use\nThe drop in carbon pollution in the power sector masked a troubling rise in other emissions. Rhodium Group estimates that emissions in buildings\u2014those from directly burning fuels to heat our homes and commercial spaces, as well as water heaters and stovetops\u2014rose by about 2 percent (on top of the 4.5 percent increase in 2018). This increase in emissions is tied to an increased use of gas \u2013 mainly in residential buildings\u2014with initial government estimates indicating a little more than a 1 percent increase in residential gas use in 2019. Gas use also rose in industry, with an estimated 7 percent increase in gas consumption in 2019. This contributed to the 0.6 percent increase in industrial emissions projected by Rhodium Group.\nThe increasing reliance and use of gas across the U.S. economy\u2014in power plants, buildings, and industrial processes\u2014is driven, in part, by a rise in domestic gas production and related slump in prices. U.S. dry natural gas production set a new record in 2019, averaging 92.0 billion cubic feet per day, a 10 percent increase from 2018\u2019s record-breaking levels. This growth in natural gas production greatly exceeded domestic needs, which has had rippling effects across the domestic and global economy. U.S. gas prices hit their lowest levels in three years, global corporate defaults rose to the second-highest levels since 2009 (driven by oil & gas defaults), and U.S. net exports of gas increased by 165 percent from 2018 levels.\nAs supply has significantly outpaced demand\u2014both here and abroad\u2014gas prices have plummeted. One result: oil and gas producers have little incentive to curb leakage. That propelled a startling rise in flaring, where unwanted or excess methane gas is burned off into the atmosphere. Almost 7,000 permits for flaring were approved in Texas alone in 2019\u2014a 40-fold increase from the 158 permits granted in the state a decade ago. Texas oil & gas producers flared enough gas in 2018 to fuel every household furnace, stove, and water heater in the state.\nThis waste also comes with a myriad of public health and climate issues. Flaring is a significant contributor to climate change. It generates noise, heat, and other local nuisances for populations nearby. Rhodium estimates that emissions from \u201cother sectors\u201d\u2014including oil & gas methane, waste, and agriculture\u2014rose 4.4 percent in 2019\u2014the largest increase of any sector analyzed by Rhodium.\n2019 saw both incredible progress and troubling obstacles to achieving a climate safe future. The power sector accelerated towards a clean future\u2014with some of the largest drops in both coal and carbon pollution seen in U.S. history\u2014and the next few years look even brighter, as wind and solar are posed for unprecedented growth across the nation. However, outside of the power sector, the story is much less optimistic. Climate-warming emissions in other areas of the economy are rising, in tandem with increasing U.S. oil and gas production and consumption. A clean energy future is possible, but we\u2019ve got a long way to go and must get started as soon as possible.","metadata":{"date":1708496778000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947473370.18\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240221034447-20240221064447-00498.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9470155835,"token_count":2033,"url":"https:\/\/www.nrdc.org\/bio\/amanda-levin\/coals-fall-drives-ghg-cut-2019-gains-may-be-short-term"},"score":4,"id":"416"}

{"text":"There are so many animals from the wild side stopping by or using our Outer Banks beaches that it\u2019s difficult to know where to begin. There is, of course, the ubiquitous ghost crab, which is a fascinating little creature. Take a flashlight and walk along the beach at night and they are everywhere.\nBut most of our visitors are not seen as often, so we\u2019ll take a look at our rarely seen if common visitors.\nThere are five species of sea turtles that visit the Outer Banks from time to time: Kemp\u2019s Ridley, green sea turtle, loggerhead, and leatherback. The hawksbill is very rare, so we\u2019ll mention it but not go into detail.\nSea turtles almost always come ashore to nest. Since every turtle on this list is considered either threatened or endangered, it is very important that nests are identified and once identified marked and protected.\nThe North Carolina Aquarium at Roanoke Island STAR (Sea Turtle Assistance and Rehabilitation) Center treats cold-stunned sea turtles in the winter and injured turtles year-round. It\u2019s a great place to see turtles up close.\nN.E.S.T. (Sea Turtle Assistance and Rehabilitation) is a local organization that has been protecting nests and helping injured sea turtles since 1995.\nThe most common sea turtle to visit the Outer Banks, Loggerheads get their name from their large head. The head has to be large to support the jaw muscles that are used to crush the shells of whelks, conch, and other mollusks that are the preferred food.\nThe shell of an adult is about 3\u2019 across; adults weigh on average almost 300 pounds.\nThe Outer Banks is a particularly important nesting location for loggerhead turtles. The largest concentration nests for the species along the East Coast is between Florida and North Carolina including the Outer Banks, although nests rarely occur north of Oregon Inlet.\nA smaller sea turtle weighing between 75-100 pounds, Kemp\u2019s Ridley does not nest in this area, but juveniles and adults are seen from time to time on our beaches.\nIts diet is similar to the loggerhead, but the Kemp\u2019s Ridley prefers shallower waters than many other sea turtles. Because they tend to be closer to the shore, they are one of the more common turtles to be cold-stunned if there is a sudden drop in temperature in the winter.\nGreen Sea Turtle\nAlmost as large as a loggerhead, the green sea turtle has the distinction of being the only sea turtle that is a vegetarian. Not completely\u2026they start as a hatchling eating worms, young crustaceans, and aquatic insects. As they age, their diet changes to exclusively seagrass and algae.\nUnlike carnivorous turtles, their jaws are serrated, enabling them to grab and tear grasses. Their heads are also smaller in relation to their bodies than other sea turtles.\nCape Hatteras is the northern range of their nesting activity.\nThey prefer shallower waters where seagrasses grow. Because of that, they are often found cold-stunned in the winter.\nThe largest turtle in the world, the leatherback weighs in at 700-1,200 pounds although the largest ever recorded was 2,019 pounds. Fossil records indicate the species has not changed in 90 million years.\nThe shell of the leatherback gives the turtle its name. A thin, rubbery skin, it covers a carapace that is composed of thousands of tiny bones creating a shell that is flexible.\nLeatherbacks are most often seen offshore in the spring as they migrate to feeding areas farther north. However, they do nest along the Outer Banks at times.\nInterestedly, the leatherback diet consists almost entirely of jellyfish, a nutrient-poor food that is 90% water.\nPlayful, intelligent, and graceful, dolphins are perhaps the marine mammal people are most familiar with. From mid-April through mid-October it is common to see a pod swimming just offshore.\nDolphins are also regular inhabitants of the Roanoke Sound. The Outer Banks Center for Dolphin Research has been studying the Roanoke Sound dolphins since 2010, documenting behaviors, relationships, and feeding habits.\nA migratory species, they are rarely seen around the Outer Banks in winter.\nThere are a number of dolphin tour outfitters locally. Nags Head Dolphin Watch collaborates with the Outer Banks Center for Dolphin Research on their tours.\nSeals are not usually associated with the Outer Banks, but they are regular visitors especially during winter migrations.\nMost of the seals are harbor seals, although occasionally a gray seal will be in the mix. They are also generally juvenile seals that cannot yet compete with adult seals for food and have been forced out of traditional winter feeding grounds to survive.\nIn almost every case, the seal is simply resting on the beach. It is neither injured nor sick and should not be approached\u2014no matter how cute it may look.\nNOAA guidelines call for people to approach no closer than 50 yards. Keep in mind that these are wild animals and if they feel threatened they will attack.\nOBX Marine Mammal Stranding Network is a local group that monitors seals and marine mammals that visit our beaches. They can be contacted at 252-455-9654 if there is any question about the health or safety of a seal.\nThere\u2019s not much chance of seeing a whale up close on the Outer Banks, but they do show up offshore on a regular basis.\nHumpback whales are often spotted late winter to early spring as they migrate to breeding and birthing areas to the south. An adult humpback is 40\u2032-50\u2019 and weighs in at 33-40 tons, so when they breach, they\u2019re easily seen.","metadata":{"date":1709127575000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947474715.58\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240228112121-20240228142121-00797.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9567558169,"token_count":1200,"url":"https:\/\/www.carolinadesigns.com\/obx-guide\/animals\/marine\/"},"score":3,"id":"418"}
{"text":"I thought I would start a separate thread here so that folks who were new to the platform would find it without getting lost.\nIf you want to use your fancy LimeSDR with gnuradio you can but to do that you need the latest sources rather than the ones that might be run by the package maintainers. I\u2019ve just re-rerun these steps on a fresh Ubuntu install to verify they work as I expect them to.\nFirst, this assumes you have no SDR packages installed (no Soapy, no LimeSuite, no UHD, no gnuradio. Nada zip)\nSecond it is important to realize that there are two abstraction layers, one called Osmosdr and one called Soapysdr. At present there is a SoapySDR driver that works with OsmoSDR so the linkage is:\nLimeSuiteAPI -> Soapy -> Osmocom -> gnuradio\nStart this process by installing the python installation tool\n$ sudo apt install pip python-apt\nThen upgrade pip to the latest:\n$ sudo pip install --upgrade pip\npip to install the gnuradio package manager\n$ sudo pip install pybombs\nThen use pybombs to install the current default recipes\n$ pybombs recipes add gr-recipes git+https::\/\/github.com\/gnuradio\/gr-recipes.git\nAt this point you can create a directory for your version of gnuradio with this:\n$ mkdir prefix\n$ pybombs prefix init -a default prefix\/default\/ -R gnuradio-default\nThis will download, and build from source, all of the things you need for gnuradio. It may stop if it finds a problem it can\u2019t overcome, for example on my system I had forgotten to remove the\nuhd-host package and that version was interfering with the one pybombs wanted to build. But if you have to restart just type\n$ pybombs install gnuradio\nAnd it will pick up where it left off. Once it is done and gnuradio is installed you need to add three more things to complete the puzzle\n$ pybombs install soapysdr limesuite gr-osmosdr\nNow you should be good to go but before you run things you should try some things.\nFirst, there will be a directory called\n~\/prefix\/default in your home directory at this point with gnuradio in it and a bunch of libraries and some python code. There is also a bit of bash shell script called\nsetup_env.sh. Before you start you should use the command:\n$ source ~\/prefix\/default\/setup-env.sh\nThis will set the environment variables LD_LIBRARY_PATH, PATH, and PYTHON_PATH so that you will get the version of the commands that were built together.\nYou can confirm this with the command\nwhich LimeUtil which should return the directory\nprefix\/default\/bin off of your home directory. And\nLimeUtil --info should show your LimeSDR connected, and\nSoapyUtil --find should find your LimeSDR as well.\nIf all that works then you can start up\ngnuradio-companion or run your gnuradio python code and it should find all of the libraries it needs to run. You won\u2019t need any special PPAs or extra packages installed usually,\npybombs should do all the work for you.","metadata":{"date":1709458343000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947476211.69\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240303075134-20240303105134-00598.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.8722704053,"token_count":747,"url":"https:\/\/discourse.myriadrf.org\/t\/latest-aug-2017-limesdr-and-gnuradio\/1563"},"score":3,"id":"419"}

{"text":"Tofu is a highly versatile and nutritious food that is made from soybean curds. Although the word \"tofu\" is Japanese, the food seems to have originated in ancient China, where the Mandarin term is \"doufu.\" The creation of tofu is generally attributed to the ruler Liu An of Huai-nan during the second century B.C. The creation of tofu was probably accidental. Although soybeans are not technically a grain, the Chinese considered the soybean one of their essential Five Sacred Grains, along with rice, wheat, barley, and millet. It is likely that Liu An prepared soybeans in much the same way as grains, by drying, mashing, and boiling. The addition of sea salt would not only have seasoned the puree, it would have also acted as a solidifying agent, forming curds. Another theory suggests that the curding process was simply imported from neighboring regions. Regardless, soybeans appear to have been processed into tofu by the second century B.C. using a sea water precipitate to solidify the tofu, a process still used by many manufacturers.\nAccording to ancient text, soybeans were cultivated in northern China at least as early as the 15th century B.C. , during the Chang period. A sixth century Chinese encyclopedia of agriculture, the first of its kind, cites that the explorer Choken brought back soybeans to China from his expeditions to Greece, Rome, and India. However, according to legend, the soya plant was cultivated centuries earlier. In 2838 B.C. , the emperor Sheng-nung wrote a treatise on plants which describes the soya plant in detail. Chinese agricultural experts in 2207 B.C. also wrote about soybean cultivation. Clearly, soybeans were an important staple crop in China for quite some time. The soybean was also recognized for its regenerative properties: the roots of soybeans contain nodules, which discharge nitrogen, and thereby enrich the soil. This important quality made its mark on the old ideogram for the soya plant \"su,\" which contained little lines to symbolize roots.\nDuring the eighth century, Chinese Buddhist missionaries introduced the soya plant to Japan and Korea, although they may have been used there much earlier. Buddhist monks believed that a vegetarian diet was healthier for the spirit so they advocated eating the protein-rich tofu as an alternative to meat. First the upper classes of Japan adopted tofu into their diets and by 1400, during the Muromachi period, tofu was popular among all classes in Japan.\nUntil about World War II most Japanese and Chinese tofu was made in small family-run shops, each of them using the same ingredients, methods, and tools. In the 1960s, the Japanese Food Research Institute made recommendations for modernizing and standardizing tofu production throughout the nation. Their suggestions included using calcium sulfate as the thickening agent, rather than the natural sea water precipitate, nigari. They also recommended using pressure cookers to speed the process. Hydraulic presses and centrifuges replaced manual lever presses and hand-turned screw presses. Higher speed grinders and aluminum boxes replaced the original wooden boxes. Despite the improvements in efficiency and productivity, many believed that the new methods compromised the flavor of tofu. Traditionalist manufacturers still retain much of the old-style tofu production.\nIn the U.S., Americans did not readily adopt soybeans into their diet. They were available by the mid-1700s and popularized by Chinese immigrants traveling to California during the Gold Rush of the mid-1800s. As the Chinese immigrants later traveled to other parts of the country, they spread the recipe for tofu. The demand for tofu and other Asian foods also increased after World War II as military personnel returned from Asia, some with Asian spouses. By the 1900s soybeans were grown as a cash crop\u2014primarily for regenerating the soil during crop rotation\u2014as animal feed, and for producing oil and oilcake residue for manufacturing purposes. By the 1950s the U.S. rivaled Asia in its production of soybeans. Forty years later, the U.S. would become the largest soybean producer in the world, providing about two-thirds of the global supply.\nDuring the 1970s, with the growing popularity of ethnic foods in the U.S., mainstream grocers began to offer products like tofu. At the same time, the price of meat soared, and tofu finally caught on as a popular substitute for meat, since tofu is high in protein and low in saturated fat. The increasing health-consciousness of the U.S. populace also contributed to the popularity of tofu. Twenty years later the tofu industry grew to more than a 4-million-pound industry.\nThe soybean is perfectly balanced in the major food categories of protein, fat, and carbohydrates as well as in vitamins, and minerals. Soybeans also contain an ideal amount and combination of amino acids that are necessary for assimilating nutrients by the human body.\nThe scientific name for the soybean is Glycine max, and it is part of the botanical family Leguminosae. The soya plant has a slightly woody stalk and reaches a height of 30-36 inches (76-91 cm). The entire plant is covered in greenish hair. The leaves grow in groups of three and fall off as the beans mature. The soya plant produces papilionaceous (butterfly-shaped) flowers that are either white, red, or purple. The pods grow from 1-2 inches (2.5-5 cm) in length, each holding two or three seeds, which become soybeans. Soya seeds are either round or oval and are similar in size to peas. Their color is usually yellow but they may also be green, purple, brown, or a mixture of colors. Soybeans are pulses, that is, the plant has a symbiotic relationship with the bacteria, called rhizobia, that emit nitrogen through nodules in the soya plant's roots.\nThe soya plant may grow as far north as 52 degrees latitude, even though it is really a sub-tropical plant. Each climate requires slight alterations for growing soybeans, but in general, the beans are sown in the middle of May with heavy machinery. As the beans ripen, the soya leaves fall off. After the short growing period of 15 weeks, only the stalks and pods remain. The plants are harvested mechanically.\nThe ingredients for making tofu are few. They include the milk of soybeans, water, and coagulating agents. The modern tofu manufacturing process is largely an automated version of the traditional method, and much of the modern equipment is made in Japan. While an individual tofu maker might work with 20 gallons (76 1) of beans at a time, a contemporary processing facility can produce about 3.5 tons of tofu per day, using 5.7 tons of soybeans.\nThe first step in making tofu is soaking the soybeans and extracting the milk. A coagulant is added to curd the milk. Traditionally the coagulant used is nigari, which is a sea water precipitate rich in minerals such as magnesium and calcium chlorides. But modern manufacturers use either calcium sulfate or magnesium chloride. The soya curds are then processed into tofu in the desired form, primarily in custard-like blocks. A variety of textures may be produced, depending on the water content. Tofu comes in soft, firm, and extra-fimn, as well as silken or in liquid form. A number of tofu flavors, such as Jalapeno and Cheddar, are also available.\nDuring the 1970s, when tofu was still a fledgling product in the U.S., there were few guidelines regulating the tofu industry. Therefore tofu manufacturers turned to the guidelines set for meat and dairy processors. One of the early complaints about tofu in the U.S. was that it tasted bland, too beany, and astringent. But genetic engineering greatly improved the flavor of the soybeans used for tofu manufacture. Researchers have discovered that the enzyme lipoxygenase causes the off-flavor, and they have been able to breed soybeans with a lower content of lipoxygenase. Another method is to neutralize the undesirable taste by adding flavors to the tofu.\nTechnology will continue to improve the flavor and texture of tofu. Dozens of new tofu products enter the market each year and have expanded that segment to more than $100 million in the 1990s. Demand for soybased food products will most likely continue to rise as medical research uncovers the health benefits associated with soybean consumption, namely the prevention and treatment of heart disease and cancer.\nToussaint-Samat, Maguelonne.

{"text":"Endometriosis Foundation of America 2014\nOutsmarting Endo - Tamer Seckin, MD\nHow many of you were at the meeting in the Metropolitan Club yesterday? Okay, quite a few. We will wrap up a couple of things but as we were just taking pictures, I could just say this; I think we are in front of a friendly crowd. You know at the pictures one of us was aware of her breasts. \"Let me cover them\", she said. Well, I believe in a fertility god. If anything I believe in what a fertility god meant 10,000 years ago for human beings. We went from the Sumerians all the way to the Greeks and modern times. Ten thousand, 12,000 years ago these gods popped out, it was all about breasts, which supplied milk. Then we brought animals to pictures. It was about the goat, it was all about their milk that fed them, fed life.\nToday, after Greek times - you know I tried to say this yesterday but my sides were not working - but I am very into archeological tomb artifacts, from my childhood. Where I came from my mother always took me to digs. Female sculptures came out from the tombs - they were always buried with their goddesses, miniature goddesses. The female was always initially fat from 10,000 years ago and for every century or every 100 years, the breasts got smaller as they found other sources of feeding I guess. The waist got thinner, the hips got bigger and we reached the esthetics of it in the Greece of 2500 years ago. Then there were the dark periods and this and that.\nBut today we understand that it was esthetics then, it was our vision then. Today, with science, the fertility god is buried within stem cells. It is the instinct of nature, it is longing for its continuation. We are just the outside appearance of the inner code. It is determined to live forever. Those are our genes; we are just symbols of them. Our children are not ours, we are not ours and our diseases are basically part of the evolution and I really see endometriosis patients as victims of the evolutionary process. Their childbearing is blocked, they are destined to have some loss of quality of life, and we are fighting the disease at a very, very deep level. I want you to understand that. It is not really what we do in our practices just trying to fix things like a car repairman. We can really work a lot but after a point if you do not understand the elements the car will never be completely \"well\".\nYesterday's meeting from that angle was very historically important for me. What was important? I knew this, I made the schedule focused areas intentionally, put the most controversial topic first, ovarian cancer and endometriosis. Hmmm, nobody wants to talk about it, it is a very scary topic. But what we know about cell trafficking from endometrium today and its stem cell origin, as far as inflammation, is important in the same manner.\nToday we know ovarian cancer - we know at least 20 to 25 percent of it is endometriosis associated elements - and we see it there. The other 75 percent is the part of ovarian cancer that pops up in the post-menopause period. We do not know if that has to do with it but most likely it is. Nobody has asked those women at the age of 65, \"How were your periods when you were 12 or 13?\" They want to live, they are challenged with cancer, they are going to die. Seventy-five to 80 percent of them are going to die. Nobody asks that particular question.\nBut, if you look at them, many of them are infertile; many of them have some, already some characteristics we know of being infertile, less children - elements there, family history. This needs to be looked up. I did comb some important minds from Memorial Sloan to look into this. Then we looked at the pathology, obviously same elements were there.\nThen we looked at the politics. I personally believe endometriosis patients are, in general, patients with pain. The etiology of their pain being endometriosis they are being advised against, there is prejudice against, at times discrimination against, health care in schools and this will come up later. If you see the ideas they will pop out. In the afternoon we will look at the most controversial robotic versus classical surgery. I personally believe that the robot is the future, it is going to happen. However, today it is like an elephant trying to do surgery in a room. It obstructs my speed basically, it kills my finesse and touch feeling that I can attain by whatever I do. It feels like eating with chopsticks versus, big chopsticks coming from the robotic assistants, I am picking up rice. It is just that way.\nWe closed the session with research. We talked about role study. It is something that we like to really dig into. It is interesting to see very shortly if something wrong happens somewhere in the body, like inflammation endometriosis. The new cells in the endometrium, which have nothing to do with what is happening outside the uterus as an inflammatory process, the new cells we catch, the stem cells, the most primitive cells, their genetic code has already changed. The signal has changed, electrically, molecularly something has changed. That repair process is already a disease process. The whole body reacts when something wrong happens somewhere. That is why we perceive pain in different manners where these widest diseases have a thousand faces.\nI will cut here. I just want, you know, if anybody wants to add something to what I have said, this is my perception of yesterday. I am really excited that we brought very beautiful speakers and the significant history of their life given to the study of endometriosis. I am proud that you are also here. If it was not for the patient's feedback we would never be anywhere. Doctors are, you know, just sitting there waiting for you to say something. If they cannot fix it they should look into why they cannot fix it.\nI will stop here and I will have Lone take over because I can talk more and more but this is not my meeting. This is your meeting. I will have no session to speak. This is my last talk.","metadata":{"date":1709181399000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947474784.33\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240229035411-20240229065411-00298.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9828133583,"token_count":1311,"url":"https:\/\/www.endofound.org\/tamer-seckin-md-outsmarting-endo?pop=on"},"score":1,"id":"423"}
{"text":"THE TRANSFORMING POWER OF MEDITATION\nBY SWAMI KAILASANANDA\n\u201cMeditate, meditate, this is the only way.\u201d\n\u2013 Swami Sivananda\nIn these times of lock-down and global insecurity, the teachings of yoga about meditation are more precious than ever. Turning within for peace and stability seems the only way.\nWe share below teachings on the transformative power of meditation as contained in \u201cThe Sivananda Book of Meditation\u201d, which was released in 2003. This book provides guidance to the preparatory steps of meditation as well as a clear understanding of its vast potential.\nThe gradual progress in physical and mental well-being that comes when you meditate is mostly silent and unseen, like the quiet unfolding of a bud into a flower in the hours of the night. Try not to set up expectations or goals for change as this may well discourage you if you feel you do not reach them within a certain time. Changes occur at deep and subtle levels and only gradually will they reveal themselves either to you or to the outside world.\nOf course, there are no objective tests to measure your progress in meditation. However there are universal indicators that all those who meditate on a regular basis will experience sooner or later.\nMeditation, a great energiser\nMeditation is a vigorous tonic to the physical system. Only recently scientists have become aware of the relationship between mind and cells. Until a few years ago they would react with extreme scepticism to yogic demonstrations of mental control over supposedly involuntary functions such as heart beat, respiration and circulation.\nThey believed the autonomic nervous system to be independent of any conscious mental process. Bio-feedback techniques now prove that most bodily functions can be controlled by concentration. Modern research substantiates the fact that the mind can control the activity of a single cell, as well as groups of cells.\nEach of the body cells is governed by the instinctive, subconscious mind. Each has both individual and collective consciousness.\nWhen thoughts and desires pour into the body, the cells are activated, and the body obeys the group demand. During meditation there is generally a tremendous acceleration of positive energy to the individual cells, rejuvenating them and retarding decay.\nThe powerful soothing waves penetrate the cells and exercise a benign influence on all its organs, setting in motion a process of healing and strengthening that prevents and cures many diseases. It is an established fact that those who meditate on a regular basis visit the doctor and hospital far less than those who do not practise.\nMeditation is a great energiser. You will feel newly alive, full of vim, vigour and vitality.\nMeditation helps to prolong the body\u2019s anabolic process of cell production, growth and repair and to reduce the catabolic, decaying process. After the age of 35 our brain cells die off at a rate of 100,000 a day; meditation reduces this decline, preventing or minimising senility.\nOnce you meditate, the time you normally devote to sleep can gradually be reduced to as little as three hours a night for advanced meditators and still you will still feel more rested and peaceful than before. You will develop a powerful digestive system, with scanty excretions and reduced food intake; you will enjoy a lightness of the body and mind. Your senses will sharpen resulting in heightened perception and enabling you to hear sounds and see objects more clearly and at a more subtle level.\nSparkling eyes, steady gaze, powerful but sweet voice, beautiful complexion and sweet smell along with a strong and healthy body will tell you that your meditation is proceeding well.\nAchieving calmness of mind\nBy decreasing the heart rate and consumption of oxygen, meditation greatly reduces stress levels and acts as powerful tonic not only to the body but also to the nervous system. Each part of the body, down to the individual cells, is allowed to relax and rejuvenate. Real progress in your practice\nis really and accurately measured by the peacefulness, serenity and calmness that you demonstrate in the waking state.\nDoes your mind seem to be shedding a little of its dullness or heaviness? Do you feel more peaceful, happier with yourself and less prone to emotional outbursts? Are\nserenity of mind and a sense of contentment starting to flourish? If the answer is yes to any of these questions then you will know that you are advancing in your practice. You will become aware that you identify closely with emotions, thoughts and actions and will gradually move away from this, assuming the role of witness, as if you were watching someone else.\nBy observing yourself without judgement or praise, you will lessen the power of your habitual thoughts and emotions to control you. In detaching from the games of the ego, you learn to take responsibility for yourself.\nIf you suffer from addictions of any kind, you will find that your cravings for the addictive substance or action will gradually fade.\nAttachments, likes and dislikes, and their accompanying restlessness and agitation of mind will diminish. Negative tendencies will become less and your mind will become steadier; your face will be calm and serene. Balance and composure, harmony, happiness and satisfaction of life will establish themselves. You will have an unruffled mind. You will be calm, tranquil and poised.\nThe development of inner clarity\nAlong with mental strength comes a corresponding expansion in the power of your intellect. The practice of concentration increases will-power and memory, the result of which is a sharp and bright intellect. Alacrity, acumen and agility will slowly broaden your capacity to turn out tremendous work.\nYour ability to clarify ideas and remove doubts will develop and as a consequence you will become skillful in making correct and speedy decisions. What used to take four hours will take only one. What was cloudy and hazy before will become clear and definite; what was difficult before will come more easily; and what was complex, bewildering and confusing will be grasped effortlessly. You will work with scientific accuracy and great efficiency. You will have a one-pointed, clear, strong, subtle mind, with mental images clear-cut and with thoughts well-defined and well-grounded. You will discriminate and detach from the trammels of day-to-day living, resulting in less stress and more peace.\nThe gradual transformation of the personality\nAs a result of this new found peace, you will experience a changed view of the universe and different patterns of behaviour will develop. Lethargy and laziness, pain and sorrow will decrease and cheerfulness and joy will grow. Because your attention to what you do as you do it will increase, you will find you live more in the present.\nThe time you spend in dreaming of an imaginary future or of an exaggerated past will lessen. You will find that you remove clutter from your life. Most meditators, within a few weeks\u2019 of starting their practice, clear out drawers, cupboards and files. You will attack, with gusto, jobs and tasks that have been waiting for you for many months. Your pending file at work, instead of being piled high, will seldom be full.\nAs you advance in your practice, you will gradually develop a love for all, even for those who despise you. Your strength of mind will allow you to bear insult and injury and to meet the challenges of everyday life with energy, fortitude and patience.\nSituations and people that previously upset you will now no longer do so.\nThe computers will still break down, the traffic still grind to a halt, the boss still put you under pressure, but you will find that you are less affected by the turmoil, keeping a cool head and balanced mind when before you were stressed, angry and anxious.\nYou will develop a magnetic and dynamic personality.\nThose who come into contact with you will be influenced by your inspiring and more compassionate behaviour, powerful speech and spiritual nature. People will draw joy, peace and strength from you. You will attract people to you and lift their mood and minds.\nThe expansion of consciousness\nThe practice of meditation releases great amounts of spiritual energy, resulting in pure thought and, in due course, intuitive knowledge. It provides a lasting spiritual rest which must be experienced to be understood. You will receive inspiration, grace, and spiritual strength. You will attain higher states of awareness and the experience of unity which leads to divinity. You will catch the glory of God and the splendour and immanence of truth. You will develop a greater sense of purpose, a more sublime goal in life. You will learn to introspect more deeply and develop a desire and willingness to engage in selfless service.\nWith meditation comes freedom from fear of death. Most people think that death is the end of existence, but in fact, death means only the extinction of the present name and form. The greater the identification with name and form, the greater is the fear.\nThe practice of meditation develops detachment from this name and form. It makes you aware of the ever-changing nature of the body and of all phenomenal existence.\nIn recognising the ephemeral nature of the world, you will begin to realise that your holding on to objects, body, emotions and your cumbersome ego-identity, is the very cause of your suffering and is due to your ignorance of your true identity.\nAs you gradually let go of this need, and as the fear of losing what you never have really possessed vanishes, your consciousness will start to expand and a new sense of Self will emerge. Eventually, you will see the Self in all beings and all beings in the Self.\nOf course, these signs of progress will not manifest immediately, and you may require many years of regular practice before you start to reap some of the more profound benefits outlined. Do not grow dejected with the idea that you are not making headway. Sometimes the progress will be imperceptible.\nHowever, even after a month or two you will start to see improvements in your life at all levels. Your friends and family will ask whether you have been on holiday or have taken some cure!\nWhen these changes do start to appear, try not to become complacent and curtail your practice. Do not become self-satisfied. This is so important. As we pointed out earlier, the layers of impurities of the mind run deep and it is only when you start to work on them that you realise how many there are. If you conquer one obstacle, another obstacle will be ready to manifest.\nIf you control the sense of taste, you may find another sense strengthens with doubled force to assail you. If you remove greed, anger may appear more forcefully than before. If you drive egoism through one door, it enters through another.\nGreat patience, perseverance, vigilance and undaunted strength are needed. Be firm, steady and steadfast. People may mock you. Be silent. People may insult you; be silent.\nEvery temptation that is resisted, every destructive thought that is curbed, every desire that is subdued, every angry word that is withheld, every noble aspiration that is encouraged, every sublime idea that is cultivated, adds to the growth of will- force, good character, and attainment of inner peace. You will engage in rich and rewarding relationships as you learn to understand yourself and others better; you will experience a full and well-lived life as you take control in ways that previously seemed impossible. Meditation paves the way for perfection; continue your practice and reap the beauty of peace and stillness that will slowly unfold within.\nSwami Kailasananda is a Yoga Acharya and director of the International Sivananda Yoga Vedanta Centres in England and France.

The nanocomposite formation is achieved in two ways: either by using functionalized polypropylenes and common organo-montmorillonites, or by using neat\/unmodified polypropylene and a semi-fluorinated organic modification for the silicates. All the hybrids can be formed by solventless melt-intercalation or extrusion, and the resulting polymer\/inorganic structures are characterized by a coexistence of intercalated and exfoliated montmorillonite layers.

The physical properties of such fibers were characterized by contact angle measurements, and the chemical structure was identified with ESCA and FTIR. ESCA showed that the modifying agent was localized at the surface of the fibers. The modified fibers were compounded with polypropylene, and composites with various amount of fibers were manufactured by injection molding. All mechanical properties were improved when treated fibers were used. SEM showed improved dispersion, wetting of fibers, and adhesion. The nature of adhesion was studied using FTIR. It was found that the surface modifying agent is covalently bonded to the fibers through esterification. The degree of esterification is enhanced by activating the modifying agent before fiber treatment. This study has shown the effects of treatment conditions on activation of reactive species and chemical reaction between fiber and modifying agent. Moreover, a better understanding has been achieved of the nature of adhesion for the system.\nTL;DR: In this paper, a linear crystalline polymers of \u03b1-olefins are synthesized and the properties of polypropylene, poly-\u03b1-butylene, and polystyrene are discussed.\nAbstract: Publisher Summary This chapter discusses crystalline high polymers of \u03b1-olefins.

{"text":"Globally, litigation funding market has a significant growth and is expected to maintain its dominance during the forecast period. Litigation funding or legal financing is a process in which a third party provides the financial assistance in order to solve costly litigation or arbitration cases in the market. In addition, litigation funding allows investors to avail extended range of a new asset class which are generally not covered under traditional form of market instruments such as property, equities, bonds, or commodities. Furthermore, litigation funder receives an agreed share of the proceeds of the claim during the financing process and has no direct interest in the proceedings of the claim.\nThe litigation funding market is segmented on the basis of service type, organization size, application, end user, and region. On the basis of service type, it is categorized into pre-settlement financing, law firm financing, post-settlement financing and others. On the basis of organization size, it is divided into small & medium enterprises and large enterprises. On the basis of application bfsi, travel & hospitality, manufacturing, it & telecommunication and others. On the basis of industrial vertical, it is classified into individuals and corporates. On the basis of region, it is studied across North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific, and LAMEA.\nThe key player covered in the litigation funding market share are Apex Litigation Finance Limited, Deminor, Longford Capital Management, LP, Augusta Ventures Ltd., VALIDITY FINANCE, LLC, Woodsford Litigation Funding Ltd., Pravati Capital LLC, IMF Bentham Limited, Harbour Litigation Funding Limited, Burford Capital, SWIFT Financial, and Balance Legal Capital LLP.\nTop impacting factors: Market Scenario Analysis, Trends, Drivers, and Impact Analysis\nIncrease in awareness toward litigation funding & access to new asset class, surge in number of claimants, and increased understanding of third-party financing are some of the factors propelling the growth of global litigation funding market growth. However, non-acceptance of third-party funding as a form of alternate dispute resolution and lack of regulation in terms of fees & interest are some of the factors hampering the market growth. Conversely, several banks & hedge funding companies are expected to provide lucrative opportunity to the market, as these business verticals are expected to finance claims at a relatively less-risky asset class and continuing to rise in the upcoming years.\nThe global litigation funding market trends are as follows:\nIncrease in understanding of third-party financing\nThe litigation funding market is growing tremendously due to increased acceptance & understanding of third-party financing. For instance, a survey conducted across U.S., Canada, and the U.K., by OmniBridgeway which is a law firm, covering over 500 chief financial officers (CFOs) and senior finance professionals. In addition, the survey projected that two-thirds of these segments were \u201cvery likely\u201d to use litigation finance in the next two years. Moreover, several large multinational companies are expanding their business & utilizing the funding to minimize the overall litigation risk and monetize litigation claims in the market.\nSurge in capital investments\nIncrease in understanding and utilization of litigation financing have led to massive growth of capital investments, which fuels the market growth. Moreover, investors are continuing to litigate funds in the alternate asset class which is expected to grow exponentially in the upcoming years. Furthermore, capital investment in these asset class are unaffected by the fluctuations in the interest rates.\nCovid-19 Scenario Analysis:\n- Global litigation funding market has a moderate impact of COVID-19, as multiple issues which are usually undertaken by the organizations depending on funding services in the market.\n- With massive government support & initiative towards providing financing to small & medium enterprises, the litigation funding market is expected to grow tremendously in the upcoming years.\n- On the contrary, during the COVID-19 pandemic situation, the process of litigation funding can be shifted from traditional methods to online processes, in order to curb the spread of the virus.\nKey benefits of the report:\n- This study presents analytical depiction of the global litigation funding market along with the current trends and future estimations to determine the imminent investment pockets.\n- The report presents information related to key drivers, restraints, and opportunities along with detailed analysis of the market share.\n- The current market is quantitatively analyzed to highlight the global litigation funding market growth scenario.\n- Porter\u2019s five forces analysis illustrates the potency of buyers & suppliers in the market.\n- The report provides a detailed market analysis based on the present and future competitive intensity of the market.\nQuestions answered in the research report:\n- Who are the leading market players active in the global litigation funding market?\n- What current trends would influence the market in the next few years?\n- What would be the detailed impact of COVID-19 on the global litigation funding market?\n- What are the driving factors, restraints, and opportunities in the global litigation funding market?\n- What are the projections for the future that would help in taking further strategic steps?\nLitigation Funding Market Report Highlights\nBy Service type\nBy Organization size\nBy End user\nKey Market Players\nBurford Capital, Augusta Ventures Ltd., LLC, VALIDITY FINANCE, SWIFT Financial, Deminor, LP, Balance Legal Capital LLP, Harbour Litigation Funding Limited, Longford Capital Management, Woodsford Litigation Funding Ltd., IMF Bentham Limited, Apex Litigation Finance Limited, Pravati Capital LLC","metadata":{"date":1708771652000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947474526.76\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240224080616-20240224110616-00098.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9369492531,"token_count":1126,"url":"https:\/\/www.alliedmarketresearch.com\/litigation-funding-market-A10395"},"score":1,"id":"426"}

You might not think it so \u2013 to you wine is probably just be something you drink with dinner, and your knowledge of what constitutes a good wine might simply be limited to what tastes good with whatever food you have prepared. However, there are many people who have made wine into their entire lives, and wine is very important to many countries \u2013 in culture, in life in general, and in people\u2019s minds as a staple of their lives. This is part of what makes wine tasting trip so fun, and so interesting. However, there is much more to going on wine country tours than simply sipping on wine in different vineyards. Wine country tours can be the most interesting, enlightening, and fun times you can ever have.\nWhat Are They About?\nYou might be thinking what wine country tours are all about. First of all, yes, the wine tasting part is included in wine country tours. You\u2019ll visit the different wineries that are located in the area you are touring, and get to sample the different great wines that they sell at these wineries. However, wine country tours are about much more than simply drinking fine wines.\nFirstly, most wine country tours include tours of the grounds where the grapes are grown that make the wine. Most people who enjoy wine don\u2019t really understand where it comes from or what makes it so special, so on wine country tours you\u2019ll have a chance to really dig down deep into the details and begin to learn more about what makes the wine so great, because you\u2019ll be learning about the grapes that are grown.\nNext, you\u2019ll be able to tour the places where the wine is actually make. This is often the best part of wine country tours because there aren\u2019t too many people in the world who know how wine is made and who can tell you the exact process behind it. On wine country tours you\u2019ll be able to see this first hand, and the next time you take a drink of wine you\u2019ll be able to think about exactly how the wine came into being.\nOften, however, the best part of wine country tours remains still the tasting of the wine. This, of course, is something that you can experience for yourself, and that you can remember always. You can also, if you\u2019re lucky, take some wine home to share with your loved ones!\nFind More Wine Articles","metadata":{"date":1708687230000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947474377.60\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240223085439-20240223115439-00899.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9790173173,"token_count":532,"url":"https:\/\/uglymugpdx.com\/make-the-most-out-of-wine-country-tours\/"},"score":1,"id":"427"}

{"text":"Main areas of learning Java programming\nLearning to programme in Java is fun but at the same time quite challenging, as we are familiarising with different concepts that makes up the whole Java technology and its structure.\nWhen you start learning Java, you have to understand that you have to make yourself knowledgeable in different areas. Here we discussed what to expect when you learn Java. I have divided the learning topics into four categories: syntax, keywords, object orientation and Application Programming Interface (APIs).\nFirst is the syntax of the programming language. By syntax we mean the different grammatical rules of writing the programme. It includes rules for declaring classes, variables and methods. You will how to provide parameters to methods and making methods available to be used from anywhere in the code. Further how to invoke different methods and pass them with actual data which also know as arguments.\nThe two most important things you do learn are how to control the blocks of code. In programming they are called control structures.\nThe control structures are further divided into two mechanisms Selection and Iteration (Loops).\nSelection is all about making decisions. To implement selection control in program we use if and switch statements. Statements in program are executed in sequence which is called sequential execution. By adding the selection statement we can actually alter the normal control flow of the program. Which course or path to select, skip or execute will be determined by some sort of test.\nIteration is to repeat a certain block on code for fixed or flexible times. To implement iteration, repetition or loop we use while, do-while and for statements. Again the repetition will perform some sort of test on each round to determine whether to continue to repeat the block of code or not. Another strategy can be used is which is known as recursion.\nKeywords are reserved words in Java that are used to write the programs and have special meaning with-in the code context where they are written. Below is the complete list of Java keywords.\nI will explain few here:\nKeyword class is used in the declaration and hence creating a class.\nKeywords if and switch is used to implement the selection in the code, they are followed by tests conditions and code body to execute.\nKeywords for, while and do are used to implement the iteration within the code\nKeywords public, private and protected acts as access modifiers and are applied to classes, variables and methods.\nKeywords byte, short, int and long are used to mark the data as an integer number by providing different sizes\/ranges.\nKeywords double and float are used to mark the data as an decimal number by providing different sizes\/ranges.\nKeyword boolean is used to track the true\/false condition and therefore it has only to possible values true or false.\nKeyword char is another data type to hold a single character.\nSimilarly all of the rest keywords have special purpose and meaning with-in the coding context and are used as and when required when solving a particular problem. You will learn and know there uses as you keep writing programs in Java.\nIt is software development methodology in which we create and develop a program as a group of objects and these objects communicate with each other by calling each other methods and therefore running the overall system.\nKnowing about Object Orientation will help you to write the programs that are easy to extend, reuse and debug.\nThe key concepts in the object orientation are to create an object as a single entity that has its own data and an interface to interact and manipulate its data. But to create objects we must define the guidelines or some sort of template that is used to create multiple copies of objects. But each object is different and unique and exits on its own.\nTo master the object orientation we need to further understand the concepts of Inheritance, Encapsulation, Abstractions and Polymorphism. We have a dedicated course at London Academy of IT that prepares you to write the programs using these object orientation techniques.\nBy following the object orientation rules we can create and develop almost every type of object virtually.\nApplication Programming Interface (API)\nAPI is vital to the success and popularity of the language. Java has one of the huge and rich API, that provides you read to use software components.\nYou can import them into your programs and customise them according to your needs. In the meantime you can focus on other important feature of the system.\nAt present Java API 8 is the updated version. You can find all the provided API components on online Java 8 documentation. More information on this can be found here: https:\/\/docs.oracle.com\/javase\/8\/docs\/api\/\nAPI arranges these components (which are actually classes and interfaces) into packages. Packages make them easy to categorise, locate and use. For example, if you want to do event driven programming using Java you can use java.awt and javax.swing packages.\nFurther if you want to read and write to different types of file using streams, you can use java.io package.\nIf you fancy connecting to the database, and perform all the CRUD functions, that is create, read, update and delete the records then java.sql package is available to do it.\nSo to write efficient code and develop robust systems we need to make sure that we are writing correct syntax, proper use of keywords, good object orientation techniques and making full use of the Java API.","metadata":{"date":1709138243000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947474737.17\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240228143955-20240228173955-00899.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9062590599,"token_count":1111,"url":"https:\/\/www.londonacademyofit.co.uk\/blog\/main-areas-of-learning-java-programming"},"score":4,"id":"429"}
{"text":"If you want to write essays for school, you have to be aware of what they are, what types of essays are generally required, how they vary from each other, and also what kinds of essay subjects are out there. Most schools need some type of essay for each and every student, in addition to individual credit for work completed in individual courses. A student might have to write 1 essay throughout the course of study, and others can have to write several different ones. If you are interested in knowing more about the type of essay you\u2019ll be writing in school, then here is a few tips to get you started.\nAn article is, in general, simply a very long piece of writing that introduces the writer\u2019s argument, but this definition is somewhat vague, encompassing even those with a simple personal letter, a newspaper article, a book, and a short story. Essays are classified as either formal or informal. Formal essays should be written in academic style, using standard grammar and style. Formal essays are usually required for higher education, though there are some schools that enable students to compose them after earning their degree. Informal essays can be written for any variety of motives, with the only restriction being that they should be short and well arranged.\nThe first thing you should know whether you would like to learn to write essays is exactly what they are not. A simple personal letter could be written in easy, colloquial language, using conventional sentence structure and utilizing regular punctuation. This allows for a much easier format also makes it perfectly okay to print. A deep dive into essay writing, however, is generally reserved for people who have taken classes in the region or for people who have taken extensive courses inside.\nA deep dive into article writing would include an extensive overview of the subject, including the background and facts of the subject being written about. It may sentence grammar check also touch on specific areas which are of specific interest for you, like the person or situation at the heart of the essay. If you are a student taking a writing course, your teacher may need an intro. Irrespective of the format used, it ought to be a comparatively brief intro that introduces the writer and provides some background on this issue.\nThe next contadordepalabras step is to write a succinct, but robust debate in support of this subject. A good way to start this process is to read past essays on precisely the same subject, to see how they compared to the info you are going to present in your essay. This is called a descriptive article, and it starts by using primary sources to paint a clear picture of the debate you will make on your essay. Even though a personal letter can be full of statements and facts, it will lack a significant amount of engaging and argumentative content if it\u2019s limited to text.\nEventually, to write essays with a high degree of clarity and conciseness, the author ought to have a superb sense of business.1 approach to achieve this would be to keep the article as brief as possible. As they say,\u201da phrase is worth a thousand words\u201d Essays that are greater than 80 pages often suffer from numerous structural mistakes, like a lack of link between segments, perplexing internal paragraphs and wrong formatting. For pupils taking a creative writing class, composing an essay will frequently require breaking up the length established to your mission into shorter, more manageable pieces.","metadata":{"date":1708744965000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947474482.98\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240224012912-20240224042912-00599.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9611786604,"token_count":696,"url":"https:\/\/www.greatgutton.co.uk\/how-to-write-essenses\/"},"score":3,"id":"430"}

The case that confronted Pilate was not vague or unclear.\nSeveral times Pilate gave the Jewish high priests the chance to submit all the evidence they could.

The obvious legal outcome of this case was to release the defendant.\nBut Pilate sentenced Jesus to death by crucifixion. Why? Because he recognized the power of the priests. They could make or break his governorship; they could cooperate in keeping things running smoothly in Judea, or they could make things difficult. Jesus had no power that mattered to Pilate.

{"text":"One of the Christian Influencers I follow said something I thought was kind of peculiar, he said, \"Because we are made in the image of God, that makes us gods here on earth.\"\nAnd I stopped a minute to think.\nOne of the things I've been practicing in my own walk with God is my ability to \"rightly divide the word of truth\" and using discernment to be able to properly apply Biblical teaching\/principles to my life. Part of this has been saturating and curating my social media feeds with Christian teachers, preachers, theologians and thought leaders who teach the Bible from a variety of views.\nStudy to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth. 2 Timothy 2:15\nEven though I have grown up in church my whole life and have been a Sunday School teacher for the past 10 years (I'm just realizing this myself and it's crazy to me) I am completely aware that I do not know everything. I am always actively seeking God, His Word and resources that help me to better understand His Word as it relates to my life.\nWhich led me to this quote. It's not that I haven't heard the concept of humans endowing themselves with power to be the master of their own universes before, but it was my first time hearing it expressly endorsed by a self-proclaiming Christian in reference to scripture.\nGenesis 1:26 says,\n\"And God said, Let us make man in our* image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.\"\nSo from the beginning yes, God created us in His image with always His divine design in place.\nThe danger with identifying as a \"god\" is that it eliminates the need for God, by allowing ourselves to be the creators of our own universes. That is to say, if we are \"gods\" in our own right, what need is there for salvation? Why then would we need to to submit to God's authority? To proclaim our selves as \"gods\" is to participate in modern day polytheism not alike many ancient religions, most notably in Greek, Roman, and tribal African cultures.\nTo believe that Jesus Christ died on the cross for our sins is to submit to His perfect plan for humanity and by extension our personal lives as it relates to His divine design.\nThe Christian walk is a journey to a singular destination and that is the restoration of our relationship to God our Father. As believers any thoughts, practices or beliefs contrary to this truth is to deviate away from a closer relationship with Him.\nThe beauty of this knowledge is that because we don't have to be our own \"gods\" we can rely on the omniscience of our God. By simply being obedient to His Word we can align ourselves with His greater purpose in our life giving us access to His power!\nLuke 10:19 says,\n\" Behold, I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy: and nothing shall by any means hurt you. \"\nGod has given us His Holy Spirit through our submission to Him and His Word to be able to conquer anything that may come against God's plan for our lives.\n\"Howbeit this kind goeth not out but by prayer and fasting. \"\nBecause we dedicate our lives back to God and His glory, there is no room for any notion that relies on ourselves.\nAll of this to say and to re-iterate that our own relationship with God is so important! We have to have our own understanding of who God is and what His word says, so that we don't always or immediately accept what others give to us as God's Word. If we are to be living epistles of His Word, then we have to know what it says! So that if anything we come across does not align with what His Word says we can rightly divide it.\nLook, sometimes I may misinterpret God's Word, we all will at some point. The point is that our relationship with God has to be strong enough to withstand our own folly and the well-intentioned misguidance of others.\nThe only Bible is The Bible and the better you know it, the better you can live it for yourself.\n*Understanding that when God says, \"our\" He is referring to the Trinity that existed before time began, as in the God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit image.","metadata":{"date":1709425483000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947476137.72\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240302215752-20240303005752-00299.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9675375223,"token_count":971,"url":"https:\/\/www.highlyandhumbly.nyc\/post\/rightly-divide"},"score":1,"id":"433"}

{"text":"(HealthNewsDigest.com) \u2013 Ensuring your eye remains healthy should be your priority, like any other part of your body. Unfortunately, delaying or failing to go for regular eye check-ups can aggravate an already existing condition. Even if your vision is clear with no noticeable vision symptoms, you still need to get your eye checked. Some eye issues resurface in their late stages when treating them becomes complicated and expensive. Get your eye checked to detect any condition in its early stages.\nHere is why you shouldn\u2019t ignore eye check-ups:\nEye exams are crucial for school going children\nEye examinations are essential for school going kids for early detection and treatment of any condition that may interfere with their learning. The check-ups for children help detect conditions like Myopia and other eye diseases, which helps them gain a good vision in education. According to Asia Retina eye specialists, children need to see what\u2019s written on the board, and that requires healthy eyesight.\nPhysical structure or eye condition examinations enable the specialists to treat and control any eye issue. Refraction errors like Myopia or near-sightedness are common in children, and among the first conditions to be examined by an eye specialist. If Myopia is present, the specialist will prescribe the needed vision correction process.\nSome eye conditions are related to hidden health issues\nDid you know your eye condition could be related to a health issue in your body? Eye examinations can help uncover any other problem in your body related to your eye condition. Diabetes is among the top causes of eye problems worldwide. Therefore, controlling your blood sugar will solve your eye problem. If diabetes goes undetected, your blood sugar will be consistently high, causing blindness or blurred vision. You may struggle to see at night or even driving safely.\nIf there is no underlying cause of your eye issue, the specialist will treat it directly. More conditions related to eye loss or vision problems include sleep apnea, a spike in cholesterol, migraines, Lyme disease, etc. Some of these conditions affecting your eyes may lead to stroke. It is vital to get checked by a specialist to arrest such problems earlier.\nVision problems cause most accidents\nEye issues like peripheral vision mean you can\u2019t see vividly or clearly. You will easily stumble upon many things and fall. Things you see appear in small sizes due to how your brain processes information increasing your chances of hitting any item along your way. You have to be careful when walking and be aware of surroundings. Glaucoma is an example of an eye disease that leads to vision blurriness, and driving with it is risky. You should get your eye checked by your doctor to treat such problems before they escalate and pose danger to yourself and others.\nGetting your eye checked by a professional regularly prevents vision issues from escalating to dangerous levels. Your eye will be properly accessed and any issue found will be treated, or controlled. Several Asia Retina eye specialists recommend early detection to prevent eye diseases and treat existing vision issues earlier. This will improve your daily life and future eye problems. So, make regular eye exam visits an integral part of your healthcare.","metadata":{"date":1708506292000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947473401.5\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240221070402-20240221100402-00598.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9321022034,"token_count":641,"url":"http:\/\/healthnewsdigest.com\/2020\/07\/11\/why-it-is-necessary-to-have-a-comprehensive-eye-exam\/"},"score":3,"id":"435"}
{"text":"The Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative was first launched in 1991 by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) to give every baby the best start in life. The aim was to remove breastfeeding barriers in health facilities such as hospitals, clinics, maternity centers and mother-child care centers. The idea was to encourage health facilities and especially maternity hospitals to implement the \u2018Ten Steps to Successful Breastfeeding\u2019. By doing so, health facilities can be accredited as \u201cBaby-Friendly\u201d by a recognized organisation to ensure a high standard of care for pregnant women and breastfeeding mothers and their babies.\nWhy is a Baby-Friendly Initiative needed in Hong Kong?\nBreastfeeding reduces the risk of babies developing many illnesses like diarrhoea, respiratory and middle ear infections, including allergies. Breastfeeding even leads to fewer illnesses in later childhood. It is also important for the mother\u2019s health, i.e. it helps the mother to recover more quickly after delivery, reduces the risk of breast, uterine and ovarian cancer, and it promotes emotional health. Enhancing breastfeeding leads to:\n- Better health for children\n- Better health for mother\n- Significant cost saving to the family\n- Significant cost saving to the society\nAccording to the Department of Health, in 2020 the proportion of mothers having initiated breastfeeding their newborn babies on discharge from hospital was 86.8%, and yet the exclusive breastfeeding rate for babies up at 4 months old was only 25.6%. This shows that mothers are aware of the benefits of breastfeeding, but encounter substantial difficulties in persisting. It takes all sectors of the society to work together to make breastfeeding easier. To achieve higher breastfeeding rates (especially exclusive breastfeeding rate) in Hong Kong, we work to promote breastfeeding awareness, advocate the protection of breastfeeding rights and create a Baby-Friendly environment in health facilities that care for mothers and babies. Regarding the latter, we encourage and facilitate all such health facilities to achieve the relevant WHO\/UNICEF standards of a Baby-Friendly health facility.","metadata":{"date":1708816433000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947474569.64\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240224212113-20240225002113-00197.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9452636242,"token_count":424,"url":"https:\/\/www.babyfriendly.org.hk\/en\/baby-friendly-hospital-initiative\/"},"score":4,"id":"436"}
{"text":"Audio file formats might not be the most exciting aspect of music and sound production, but understanding them is incredibly important. Otherwise, you risk making a frustrating and potentially costly mistake that affects the recording you worked so hard to create.\nIn this guide, we\u2019re going to demystify lossless and uncompressed audio formats so that you can save your files with confidence.\nUncompressed vs. Lossless Audio Formats\nAn uncompressed audio format is created when no compression algorithm or codec has been utilized to compress the audio within a file. In simplest terms, an uncompressed audio file is an exact reproduction of the original. So, while there\u2019s no decrease in original sound quality, this extra-large audio file format requires significant storage space.\nA lossless audio format has been compressed for improved efficiency and practicality. Even so, sound quality should not be negatively impacted.\nOn the far end of the spectrum are lossy tracks. This audio format is significantly smaller, making it easy to download and store. However, the compression process requires that some audio information be discarded, so a certain amount of quality can be lost.\nUncompressed File Formats: WAV and AIFF\nThe two most popular uncompressed audio file formats are WAV and AIFF, based on Pulse Code Modulation (PCM). These two file formats use very similar technology, but their approach to data storage differs slightly. Both WAV and AIFF can store high-resolution or CD-quality audio.\n- WAV was originally developed by Microsoft\/IBM and is used in Windows-based platforms. It is also the standard format for CDs.\n- AIFF was created by Apple. Although this format isn\u2019t as widely used, it has improved metadata capabilities (so you can include song titles, album artwork, and other details).\nThe main drawback to these uncompressed formats is that they take up much space on your hard drive, averaging about 10MB per minute in audio length.\nLossless Audio Formats: ALAC, FLAC, and WMA\nThe FLAC (Free Lossless Audio Codec) is compressed to about half the size of an equivalent uncompressed AIFF or WAV without any decrease in sound quality. Additionally, FLAC files can offer even better resolution than CD quality.\nALAC (Apple Lossless) and WMA (Windows Media Audio) are two other lossless audio file formats. They are slightly less compact than the FLAC, so keep that in mind.\nLossy Audio Formats: AAC and MP3\nMost of us are very familiar with MP3s since they are frequently used for music storage on portable players, tablets, and smartphones. They are extremely convenient and require minimal storage space, but there is a significant loss of original audio data. This loss equals a decrease in sound quality, which can be affected even more depending on the bit rate used to record the MP3.\nAAC (Advanced Audio Coding) is Apple\u2019s version of a lossy audio file format. It\u2019s compressed similarly to an MP3 but provides improved efficiency and an overall higher sound quality. AAC is used for YouTube streaming and Apple Music streaming.\nWhat is the Best Audio File Format?\nUltimately, choosing the right audio format comes down to your needs. You\u2019ll need to balance sound quality, storage space, and compatibility to select a suitable file format.\nDiscover Your Future in Audio Engineering Today\nAre you interested in learning how to get a job as an audio engineer?

{"text":"Why children are more likely to develop food allergies\nAn estimated 15 million Americans suffer from food allergies, many of them children. These are non-trivial concerns, as food allergy or intolerance can cause symptoms ranging from a harmless skin rash to a potentially lethal anaphylactic shock. The good news is that many affected children outgrow their allergy, presumably as the immune system learns to tolerate food initially mistaken as \"foreign.\"\nA new study published in the January 28, 2016, online issue of Science by La Jolla Institute for Allergy and Immunology (LJI) researcher Charles Surh, Ph.D., may explain how food tolerance emerges over time in normal individuals.\nCoupling molecular approaches with a long-forgotten model of \"antigen-free\" mice, the study is the first to demonstrate that consumption of a normal diet stimulates cells in the gut that suppress rejection of food by the immune system. Knowing this could explain why children, who have more limited exposure to novel foods than adults, are more susceptible to food allergies.\n\"The immune system evolved to protect us from things that are not ourselves, like viruses or pathogens, yet we consume nutrients, which are themselves foreign,\" says Surh, an adjunct professor in LJI's Division of Developmental Immunology. \"Our work shows food tolerance is acquired and involves specific populations of T cells that develop following its consumption. Without them, we would mount a strong immune response to macromolecules contained in food.\"\nLike pathogens, food displays macromolecular markers known as antigens that announce to the immune system that food is \"foreign.\" Previous analysis of how the body distinguishes antigenic friend from foe revealed that feeding lab mice a novel test protein--for example, the egg protein ovalbumin--induced development of immunosuppressive T-regulatory, or \"Treg\" cells, in the gut, which then acted to block the immune response to that particular protein. What researchers didn't know was whether this happened in \"real life\" as young mammals--be they mouse pups or human toddlers--encountered new foods.\nTo address that question, Surh re-established \"antigen-free\" mouse models designed to represent an immunological blank slate. These animals were not only raised in a germ-free environment but were also fed an \"elemental\" diet of amino acids, the building blocks of proteins, rather than foods that contain intact proteins themselves. The mice were, in essence, immunologically na\u00efve, because the amino acid building blocks are too small to be recognized by the immune system. These mice therefore have little or no prior contact with antigenic proteins and other macromolecules.\nUsing molecular marker analysis, Surh and colleagues found that antigen-free mice were depleted of Tregs in the small intestine whereas a large number of these Tregs were present in germ-free counterparts fed a \"normal\" protein diet. That difference alone suggested that proteins contained in food stimulate Treg development. It also hinted that Tregs present in the gut of normal mice might suppress a potentially disastrous immune response to those proteins.\nSurh says antigen-free mice are not new, just forgotten, as their prototypes were developed over 30 years ago to study nutrition. \"We brought them back because we're no longer in the dark ages: We know a lot more about immunology!\" he says. \"Decades ago, researchers could monitor changes in lymphocyte numbers but couldn't distinguish between cell types like we can now.\"\nThe researchers took full advantage of these technical advances to also demonstrate that food and the beneficial bacteria in the intestine generate molecularly distinct populations of Tregs. Hence, germ-free mice only possess the food-dependent Treg, but not the Tregs that are induced by the healthy microbes. Intriguingly, germ-free mice are known to be highly susceptible to allergies. Hence, Surh hypothesizes that the presence of both food- and microbe-induced populations of Tregs is required to prevent allergic symptoms.\nFinally, the team revealed what happens when immune cells fail to ignore harmless antigens. To do so, they transferred \"reporter\" T cells designed to serve as a read-out for an immune reaction into antigen-free mice and then fed mice a test protein they had never encountered (the lab stand-by, ovalbumin). Those mice mounted a massive immune reaction--what Surh calls the default response-- to ovalbumin relative to germ-free mice fed a normal diet.\nThis dramatically inappropriate reaction to a nutrient resembled the immunological storm aroused by harmful microbes. Surh's group concludes that it occurred because the antigen-free mice had not readied a population of immunosuppressive Tregs that would normally be primed to dampen an inflammatory response to food.\nBy extension, the new work could explain why children, who have more limited exposure to different types of novel nutritious macromolecules (that is, food) than adults, are more susceptible to food allergies. It also suggests what happens on a cellular basis as some outgrow it: namely, they may be expanding their repertoire of Tregs that recognize new foods as \"safe.\"\nThose issues continue to interest Surh, who in addition to his position at LJI is a director and professor in the Academy of Immunology and Microbiology (AIM) at the Institute for Basic Science (IBS) in Pohang, in Korea. \"We are now examining the cellular and molecular details of how the 'default' strong T cell response to food is regulated,\" he says. \"In this context, we plan to pay particular attention to certain foods, such as peanut, egg and other foods that cause food allergy.\"","metadata":{"date":1708889313000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947474641.34\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240225171204-20240225201204-00798.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9558411241,"token_count":1178,"url":"http:\/\/www.bio-analysis.com\/gr\/blog\/why-children-are-more-likely-to-develop-food-allergies"},"score":4,"id":"446"}
{"text":"Last weekend my children got to meet their favourite tractor. I hadn\u2019t told them in advance of where they were going but I knew they\u2019d be excited and have a fun day! We went to Bowood House, where Tractor Ted\u2019s Farm show was being held and we weren\u2019t disappointed, both in the displays and the weather \u2013 it was scorching!!\nMy children ran through the gates in total amazement at all the tractors and farm machinery ahead of them, more excited than I expected to be honest but they loved it! They\u2019ve watched Tractor Ted\u2019s dvd many times and have been pretty glued, and this showed through here at the show. I half expected them to walk past but they were interested and intrigued and recognised certain vehicles that they saw.\nThe children were keen to check out everything so we had a walk around, viewing different things in marquees, such as farm animals, including some mega cute baby chicks! There were several Tractor Ted marquees, where we did some colouring, had a go on little ride on diggers and browsed around their shop \u2013 which had special prices available just for the show!\nWe also very briefly met up with the lovely Mary from Over 40 and a Mum to One, a shame we didn\u2019t have time to catch up for longer but there\u2019ll be time for that next weekend at Britmums!\nWe took a family ride in a trailer, towed by a huge CLAAS tractor around the Bowood estate, saw some sheep being sheared and then watched some amazing JCB displays in the arena. One of our favourite things was the Bowood Lamb National, a race between five sheep, which the children thought it was hilarious!\nOne thing my children had spotted was the funfair, I don\u2019t normally like paying for them to go on these sort of rides but as we hadn\u2019t paid to go in, and they had been so well behaved, I said they can choose two each. Miss M, the fearless and ever daring girl that she is wanted to try the trampolines in harnesses and the mini quad bikes which she really enjoyed. Mister B whose a bit timid and shy stuck to the bouncy slide and swings.\nLast but not least, my children had been requesting all day to have a go on Tractor Ted\u2019s bouncy castle, so we let them have a go before the long drive home. They loved it and it made a great end to a great day!","metadata":{"date":1708851328000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947474594.56\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240225071740-20240225101740-00498.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9870243669,"token_count":523,"url":"https:\/\/mummyslittlestars.com\/tractor-ted-farm-show-bowood-house\/"},"score":0,"id":"447"}
{"text":"When developing a Python application that interacts with web services or APIs, it is often necessary to view the complete HTTP request being sent. This information can be crucial for debugging, understanding the application\u2019s behavior, and ensuring the correct data is being transmitted. In this article, we will explore how to view the complete HTTP request sent by a Python application in Python 3.\nUnderstanding HTTP Requests\nBefore diving into the details of viewing HTTP requests in Python, it is important to have a basic understanding of how HTTP requests work. HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the protocol used for transmitting data over the internet. An HTTP request consists of a request line, headers, and an optional body.\nThe request line contains the HTTP method (such as GET, POST, or PUT), the target URL, and the HTTP version. Headers provide additional information about the request, such as the content type, cookies, and authentication details. The body, which is optional, contains the data being sent with the request, such as form data or JSON payloads.\nUsing the requests Library\nIn Python, the\nrequests library is a popular choice for making HTTP requests. It provides a simple and intuitive API for sending requests and handling responses. To view the complete HTTP request sent by a Python application using the\nrequests library, we can make use of the\nrequest attribute of the\nimport requests response = requests.get('https:\/\/api.example.com') print(response.request.method) print(response.request.url) print(response.request.headers) print(response.request.body)\nIn the example above, we first make a GET request to the URL \u2018https:\/\/api.example.com\u2019 using the\nrequests.get() function. The response object contains a\nrequest attribute that provides access to the original request object. We can then access various properties of the request object, such as the method, URL, headers, and body.\nInspecting the HTTP Request\nBy printing the relevant properties of the request object, we can inspect the complete HTTP request sent by our Python application. For example,\nresponse.request.method will print the HTTP method used in the request, such as \u2018GET\u2019 or \u2018POST\u2019.\nresponse.request.url will display the target URL, and\nresponse.request.headers will show the headers sent with the request.\nIt is important to note that the\nresponse.request.body property will only contain the request body if it was explicitly set in the original request. If the request does not have a body, this property will be\nNone. Therefore, it is necessary to handle this case appropriately in our code.\nBeing able to view the complete HTTP request sent by a Python application is a valuable skill for developers working with web services and APIs. By using the\nrequests library and accessing the\nrequest attribute of the\nResponse object, we can easily inspect the method, URL, headers, and body of the original request. This information can greatly aid in debugging and understanding the behavior of our Python application.\nExample 1: Using the requests library\nTo view the complete HTTP request sent by a Python application, you can use the requests library in Python. Here\u2019s an example:\nimport requests # Send a GET request to a URL response = requests.get('https:\/\/www.example.com') # Print the complete HTTP request print(response.request.headers) print(response.request.body)\nExample 2: Using the urllib library\nAnother way to view the complete HTTP request is by using the urllib library in Python. Here\u2019s an example:\nfrom urllib import request # Create a request object req = request.Request('https:\/\/www.example.com') # Send the request and get the response response = request.urlopen(req) # Print the complete HTTP request print(req.headers) print(req.data)\nViewing the complete HTTP request sent by a Python application is essential for debugging and understanding the communication between the application and the server. By using libraries like requests or urllib, you can easily access the headers and body of the request. This information can be helpful in troubleshooting issues, analyzing network traffic, and ensuring the proper functioning of your Python application.","metadata":{"date":1709135667000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947474737.17\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240228143955-20240228173955-00897.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.8278448582,"token_count":893,"url":"https:\/\/dnmtechs.com\/viewing-the-complete-http-request-sent-by-a-python-application-in-python-3\/"},"score":4,"id":"448"}

{"text":"- Changes in diet and exercise do not fully explain the steep rise in overweight and obesity over recent decades.\n- One theory claims that chemicals in everyday plastic products promote weight gain by changing human metabolism.\n- A new study found that a range of plastic household items contain thousands of chemicals, many of them unknown.\n- One-third of the items contained chemicals that, after extraction, caused the growth and proliferation of mouse fat cells in the lab.\nChemicals in plastic household items such as drinks bottles, yogurt pots, and freezer bags may be contributing to the\nThe chemicals may alter human metabolism by promoting the growth of fat cells, or adipocytes.\nAccording to the\nThe WHO estimates that in 2016, more than 1.9 billion adults were overweight. Of these individuals, more than 650 million had obesity.\nHaving excess body weight increases a person\u2019s risk of type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, non-alcohol-related fatty liver disease, stroke, and certain types of cancer.\nResearch suggests that factors such as changes in diet are insufficient to explain the scale of the obesity epidemic and the speed with which it has spread around the world.\nOne possible culprit is the effect of synthetic chemicals in our environment called endocrine disruptors. These influence the endocrine system, which includes the hormones that regulate appetite, metabolism, and weight, among other bodily functions.\nThese chemicals affect human development and fertility, and lab-based experiments indicate that they may also promote obesity.\nHowever, plastics contain thousands of chemicals. Products made from plastic comprise one or more polymers, but manufacturers also add chemical fillers and additives to achieve the desired properties.\nA 2019 study estimates that plastic food packaging alone could contain more than 4,000 known substances that appear in chemical databases.\nHowever, biologists at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology in Trondheim suspected that there might be many unknown chemicals in plastic products that do not appear in the databases.\nThey used methanol to extract chemicals from 34 everyday products, including freezer bags, yogurt pots, drinks bottles, vegetable trays, scouring pads, and coffee cup lids.\nCrucially, they used a technique called nontarget high resolution mass spectrometry, which identifies both known and unknown substances, to find chemicals.\nThey detected a total of 55,300 chemical features and tentatively identified 629 substances that are already in databases, including 11 that are known to disrupt metabolism.\nFinally, they tested extracts from each of the products on a type of mouse precursor cell that can differentiate into fat cells.\nThey compared the effect of the extracts with those of a reference chemical \u2014 a diabetes drug called rosiglitazone (Avandia) that has well-known metabolic effects.\nThe chemical cocktails from four out of the 34 products transformed precursor cells into adipocytes that were larger and contained more fat than rosiglitazone-treated cells. Chemicals from 11 of the products induced the formation of adipocytes.\nThe results have been published in Environmental Science & Technology.\n\u201cIt\u2019s very likely that it is not the usual suspects, such as bisphenol A, causing these metabolic disturbances,\u201d says first author Johannes V\u00f6lker, Ph.D., who is affiliated with the university\u2019s biology department.\n\u201cThis means that other plastic chemicals than the ones we already know could be contributing to overweight and obesity,\u201d he adds.\nThey emphasize that food packaging is not the only potential source of metabolism-disrupting chemicals.\nThe substances may also find their way into the body through the skin \u2014 for example, from plastic shower slippers or when inhaling dust that has been in contact with plastic flooring.\nIn their paper, the authors conclude:\n\u201cGiven the potency of the extracted mixtures and considering our close and constant contact with plastics, our results support the idea that plastic chemicals can contribute to an obesogenic environment and, thus, the obesity pandemic.\u201d\nHowever, they acknowledge that the results are not definitive, since the experiments took place in cells growing in dishes in the lab rather than in whole animals.\n\u201cIt is too early to quantify the contribution of plastic chemicals to obesity from a public health perspective, mainly because our work was done in vitro, not in vivo, and the causative chemicals remain unknown,\u201d said senior author Martin Wagner, Ph.D., an associate professor of biology at the university.\n\u201cSo, we cannot draw a causal link to what is happening in human populations so far,\u201d he told Medical News Today.\nHowever, he pointed out that there is good evidence from in vivo and epidemiological studies that bisphenol A is associated with obesity.\nIn a tweet, he called for manufacturers to make their plastics chemically simpler and safer.\nThe researchers used methanol to extract chemicals from the plastics, which may not reflect what happens under everyday conditions.\n\u201cThe authors are studying extraction rather than migration,\u201d said Chris Howick, who is chairperson of the product safety committee at the British Plastics Federation.\n\u201cThe authors are removing ingredients that would normally remain in the sample throughout its lifetime \u2014 as an example, flexible PVC products do not generally become brittle over their lifetimes since the plasticizer remains in the product,\u201d he told MNT.\nHowever, Prof. Wagner said that in a previous study, his team demonstrated that many chemicals do, in fact, leach from plastic products in a standard test for food contact materials that uses water only.\n\u201cWe also found that these migrates induced in vitro toxicity, including endocrine-disrupting effects,\u201d he said.\n\u201cFor the metabolism-disrupting compounds, we have not done this type of experiment yet, so it is too early to tell if these also leach,\u201d he added.\nIn their new paper, the authors also acknowledge that they analyzed plastic packaging that had contained food or personal care products.\n\u201cBecause chemical migration is not a one-way street, we cannot exclude the possibility that compounds from the contents migrated into the packaging,\u201d they write.\n\u201cThis is an ever-present challenge in migration studies, and it is common, especially for food with a high fat content, for migration of food into the plastics to exceed any migration from the plastic into the food,\u201d said Howick.\nHe also pointed out that certain foods have well-established effects on the endocrine system.","metadata":{"date":1708985914000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947474663.47\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240226194006-20240226224006-00599.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9620878696,"token_count":1344,"url":"https:\/\/www.medicalnewstoday.com\/articles\/chemicals-in-everyday-plastic-items-may-lead-to-weight-gain"},"score":4,"id":"454"}

{"text":"The darkness of the universe: Insufficient light or insufficient material?\nSurmises concerning light\nContemplation of the various images of our universe reveals that the distinctive darkness of the universe is the result of far more than its vastness and emptiness and a lack of enough sources of light. In these images, we see cosmic objects\u2014those that emit light and those only reflect light\u2014appearing amid absolute darkness. During a total solar eclipse, for instance, the gas area that makes up the outermost atmosphere of the Sun, the corona, is illuminated; but just beyond the corona, the space is dark, although the Sun\u2019s light is indisputably traveling through it.\nThe space that separates the Earth and the Moon offers another good example: the Sun\u2019s light has no effect of illumination throughout this area. It is only when the Sun\u2019s light contact with the Moon\u2019 surface that its illuminating effect is \u201cturned on.\u201d Similarly, the space beyond the Moon, which is undoubtedly dominated with the Sun\u2019s light, appears dark. The light traveling through it remains, in effect, undetected, until it illuminates the surface of a planet, a comet, or any another object that may be traveling through this area of space.\nThe far outer space, too, offers further examples of how the effect of illumination occurs where there is material. In the deep-field photographs of the Hubble Space Telescope, where collections of gases occupy a region of space, we can easily observe illuminated hazy areas amid the distinctive darkness; and, if the emitted radiation of stars meets a dense region of collected gases and dust, the illuminating effect creates what are known as reflecting nebulae.\nWouldn\u2019t these examples suggest that where there is material in the universe, there is illumination, rather than where there is light? Wouldn\u2019t they further suggest that the very radiations that create visible light are invisible, and that visible light\u2015instead of being considered as a singular visible radiation\u2015may be simply just a visible effect ensuing form the contact of some invisible radiations emitted by hot bodies with an object?\nIn the photographs taken by astronauts on the surface of the Moon, a likely affirmative answer to these two questions can be found. In these photographs, which were taken during the Moon\u2019s two-week-long daytime, we see the astronauts against a dark background of space, while the Sun illuminates the ground on which they are standing. If the Moon had an atmosphere through which the Sun\u2019s radiations had traveled, the astronauts would have appeared against an illuminated background. But such material\u2014gases for an atmosphere\u2014was not found, and so the effect\u2014illumination\u2014did not occur. For that very reason, if a photograph was taken for the Sun from the Moon\u2019s surface, the space between the Moon and the Sun would not have appeared illuminated; in other words, a looker at the Sun from the Moon\u2019s surface would see all the area between the Sun and the Moon bathing in absolute darkness.\nThe twinkling of stars in the night sky may support my opinion that visible light is a product ensuing from the contact of some invisible radiations emitted by hot bodies with a material. The twinkling of stars, I think, is just an apparent observable fact caused by the movements occur in the layers of air in Earth\u2019s atmosphere. In my opinion, the movements of air in Earth\u2019s atmosphere alters the point of contact of a star\u2019s radiations with the atmosphere while penetrating through it\u2015the point, according to my suggestion, at which star\u2019s invisible radiations become \u201cturned on\u201d as visible light. It is these alterations in \u201cthe point of producing a star\u2019s visible light\u201d that make stars appear to us as if they were twinkling.\nA planet does not twinkle whatever far is its distance from the Earth. This means that the reflected visible light, which ensued from the contact between a planet\u2019s surface with the Sun\u2019s radiations, differs in its nature from the radiations reach us from a star: were the light reaching our eyes from planets similar to the radiations emitted by stars, they would all act in the same apparent method\u2015either they would all twinkle or they all would not.\nHow a picture of a star, then, form in our eyes in the same way a picture of a planet does? A picture of an object forms in our eyes when some invisible radiations, produced by heated-up bodies, contact with it, and then this object reflects the product resulted from this contact\u2015visible light\u2015to our retinas. In the case of stars, accordingly, the point of contact at which their visibility occurs in our eyes is\u2015not the point at which the radiations emitted by them meet our retinas\u2015but the outer surface of their bodies, where the invisible radiations produced within them are turned into visible light, through the contact with the material that makes up their surfaces: this produced visible light is reflected by the stars\u2019 surfaces to our eyes.\nIt is the seven colors into which the white light we receive from the Sun is split up when passing through a prism, that make me think that the white light we receive from the Sun is ensued from seven invisible radiations emitted by the Sun, each one of these radiations is responsible for one of the rainbow colors.\nAlong with what we call visible light, the electromagnetic spectrum includes six different radiations, three of which are of wavelength shorter than that of what we call light, while the three others are of wavelength longer than light\u2019s. If it is to be proved that each one of the six electromagnetic radiations other than what we call light\u2015gamma, x-ray, ultraviolet, infrared, microwave, radio wave\u2015 is responsible for one of the rainbow colors, then the Sun\u2019s white light is produced at the interference point of these seven radiation; and the seventh color signifies one unknown type of electromagnetic radiation.\nI think the suggestion that what we call light is produced at the interference point of the electromagnetic radiations when contact with an object, may be supported by tree facts: (1) James Clerk Maxwell\u2019s equation that proves that all forms of electromagnetic waves travel at the speed of light; (2) the characteristic phenomenon which light shares with the other forms of electromagnetic radiations\u2015the process so called diffraction, that is, light and all the electromagnetic radiations bend to the sides when they pass through a small hole, and then spread out; (3) the device that researcher in Finland and Belarus have produced, which they called \u201cmetasheet\u201d\u2015a material into which were embedded wire helices capable of absorbing electromagnetic radiation in a very narrow band of wavelengths, but remain transparent for the others in the spectrum; the metasheet worked for microwave radiation, and a modified design was obtained to work for visible light.\nTo sum up, I think that the darkness of the universe is not due to its vastness or a lack of sources of light. For the radiations that crate visible light dominate every spot of the universe, but the universe remains dark only because there are no enough material to \u201cturn on\u201d the illuminating effect of the radiations emitted by the countless billions of stars found within. I think, as well, that visible light is not a singular radiation emitted by hot bodies, but just a product resulted from the contact of the electromagnetic radiations, at their interference point, with an object; and that the wavelength attributed to what we call visible light signifies the wavelength of the point of interference of the radiations emitted by a hot body.","metadata":{"date":1709446483000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947476205.65\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240303043351-20240303073351-00198.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9513682127,"token_count":1588,"url":"https:\/\/www.abctales.com\/comment\/663193"},"score":4,"id":"459"}

{"text":"From the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic, scientists and medical professionals alike have warned those over the age of 60, as well as anyone with underlying health conditions or weakened immune systems, to be extra cautious, as the effects of the virus are more likely to be harmful to older and immuno-compromised parties. But apparently, the environment can also take an extra toll on the virus' victims.\nStudies are now showing that air pollution may be linked to higher coronavirus-related death rates \u2014 stay tuned for everything we know regarding the matter.\nScientists now say air pollution is linked to greater coronavirus fatalities.\nNew research regarding the coronavirus is coming out every single day, and Harvard University T.H. Chan School of Public Health's latest study shows that patients who have had long term exposure to air pollution (specifically PM 2.5) are more likely to die from the disease, according to The New York Times.\nAfter analyzing 3,080 counties nationwide, scientists found that patients living in cleaner cities are less likely to succumb to the infection, as their lungs are stronger and can more easily fight off infections like COVID-19. Sadly, the study also showed that if New York City had lowered its PM 2.5 levels by just one microgram per cubic meter over the last two decades, almost 250 lives could have been saved by this point in the pandemic.\nWith these new findings, hospitals are urged to use special precautions around patients who have had extended amounts of exposure to air pollution. However, finding the proper resources in areas like New York City can be especially difficult when hospitals citywide are low on ventilators and other medical necessities.\nHow can we use the information from this study moving forward?\nApparently, studies conducted during the 2003 SARS outbreak also showed a link between air pollution and fatalities, which means these results were somewhat expected, according to The Guardian. This obviously indicates a need for change, Xiao Wu from the Harvard study says, and hopefully, pollution-heavy areas will be able to get their hands on the resources they need, and make changes for the future.\n\"This information can help us prepare by encouraging populations [with high pollution exposure] to take extra precautions and allocate extra resources to reduce the risk of poor outcomes from Covid-19. It is likely that Covid-19 will be a part of our lives for quite a long time, despite our hope for a vaccine or treatment. In light of this, we should consider additional measures to protect ourselves from pollution exposure to reduce the Covid-19 death toll,\u201d Wu said, according to The Guardian.\nHowever, the coronavirus has led to less air pollution, and hopefully it will continue to stay that way.\nDue to the coronavirus outbreak, all non-essential businesses are closed, factories are shut down, air travel is essentially non-existent, and very few cars can be seen driving through city streets. Since human activity has lowered, especially in highly populated areas like Northern Italy and India, air pollution has dropped significantly.\nWill it stay that way? Ideally, local governments will take the actions needed for pollutant numbers to continue declining, especially after these studies were conducted \u2014 cleaner air truly can save lives.\nThe best way to prevent contracting or spreading coronavirus is with thorough hand washing and social distancing. If you feel you may be experiencing symptoms of coronavirus, which include persistent cough (usually dry), fever, shortness of breath, and fatigue, please call your doctor before going to get tested.

{"text":"Marvel's new show, WandaVision, premiered earlier this year on Disney+ to much excitement. However, it's not your typical Marvel movie. It's more of a sitcom than the standard action film that fans of the franchise are used to. The series takes place after Avengers: Endgame and features Wanda and Vision as the main characters. Not much is known about the future of the series right now, but fans are likely to get answers soon. Like many other shows on Disney+, episodes are being released weekly, so if don't like waiting for new episodes every week, you might want to wait until to end to binge all of it at once.\nWorship Song of the Week\nHillsong's recently released a new single titled Fresh Wind. Brooke Ligertwood had this to say about the song: \"Fresh wind is not only a worship song for any new believer with whom it might resonate but the sincere cry of our heart for Christ's Church. In a world angry and divided, we truly need the Church to be 'the fragrance of Christ' - and we cannot be and dare not try to be without the help of the precious Holy Spirit. We - really - need a fresh wind.\" This song was clearly created to breathe life into God's people. Take a couple of minutes to listen to it for yourself and allow it to breathe life into you.\nGame of the Week\nOutscord's Facebook page is an excellent place to check out if you're struggling with game ideas. They have many videos that feature numerous game ideas. One of their most recent videos features games that you can play that incorporate a mask. Since everyone's got to wear them, why not make a game out of it? One simple game that you can play involves a mask and a water bottle. Start with the bottle sideways on the table. The goal is to simply set the water bottle upright, but players are required to use the mask to do this - they can't use their hands. It's a lot harder than it sounds.\nChallenge people to seek their own fresh wind (connect with the song). Talk about the Upperroom in Acts 2.\nHow awesome would it be to have our own upper room experience like the disciples did on the day of Pentecost when the Holy Spirit rushed in like a violent wind? Imagine having a revival that powerful today. I think almost everyone would agree that a revival like that would be incredible.

{"text":"Tycho Brahe was a 16th century Danish astronomer who cared about data. He had a gold nose (though not in his portrait) and an epic mustache (shown in portrait). Tycho was obsessed with tracking the motion of celestial objects, and he kept meticulous records of his observations.\nTycho leveraged his data to make breakthrough discoveries about supernovae and comets, but, despite his scientific successes, Tycho's eyes were always set on a grander discovery. Tycho strived to decipher the laws governing our solar system.\nWhile Tycho struggled to uncover the laws governing our solar system, Johannes Kepler came to apprentice for Tycho. And, to make a long story short, Kepler eventually used Tycho's excellent data to decode what are now called Kepler's laws of planetary motion.\nBefore getting access to Tycho's data, Kepler searched for years to uncover the laws of planetary motion. Kepler only made his historic discovery after accessing Tycho's data. Kepler gets all the glory in the history books, but it was Tycho's data that gave Kepler the context to construct the laws and the evidence to support his findings.\nTycho's work to gather data and test hypotheses against empirical data changed the world. Tycho did not decode the laws governing the solar system, but his work and data allowed for Kepler to make his great breakthrough. The lesson we take from Tycho Brahe is that data is the key.

{"text":"Any good work of literature must always have a plot that drags the reader into understanding the development of the story. Every story structure has a basic list of ingredients, and these are known as dramatic arcs which are parts of the story. These parts include exposition, rising action, climax, falling action and resolution also known as denouement. The role of this structure is to help writers organize their ideas when describing the plot of the story. Fahrenheit 451 utilizes these different parts of the arcs of storytelling to achieve a perfect plot or development of the protagonist Montag.\nThe exposition of the story begins when the author mentions that, \"It was a pleasure to burn\" (Bradbury 1). The expression at this point introduces the audience to the protagonist and at the same time highlighting significant background information. The fact that the Montag, the protagonist, finds pleasure in burning books triggers the need for the reader to understand the importance of this practice. Additionally, the statement sets the mood or tone of the novel, because books are basic needs to learning. The other element of exposition that the author achieves is using the character's thoughts while telling a back-story to introduce the readers to the setting of the book which is a dystopian society in autumn (Bradbury 3). The author introduces the readers to the conflict as well when he explains that the story is set in the future where owning books is illegal.\nThe next is act is rising action which helps in building up the conflict to the point of most significant interest. It usually entails the actions that immediately follows exposition. The author successfully uses this element in building up the conflict by introducing Clarisse who asks Montag if he is happy with his work, and elaborating it further when Mildred sets herself and her books on fire that causes Montag to hide a book in his house. It is in these series of events that Montag starts to doubt himself and his practices of taking part in burning. He starts to feel like he has an identity crisis. Montag begins to give serious thoughts to the question asked by Clarisse when she goes missing (Bradbury 29). Montag understands that his wife is not happy either. Montag thoughts worsen when he witnesses an old woman choosing to burn with her books instead of losing them (Bradbury 37). The protagonist's inner conflict causes him to get sick w he gets visited by his supervisor Captain Beatty who suspects that Montag has stolen and kept a book. Captain Beatty tries convincing Montag that books are evil to the society (Bradbury 50). The conflict causes Montag to start reading (Bradbury 65), after which he seeks out Professor Faber in the hopes that he can understand literature.\nThe climax of the story usually is the turning point that alters the fate of the protagonist. In this part, if things are going right in the life of the character, the plot starts unfolding against his or her favor. The climax in Fahrenheit 451 happens when the firemen answer the alarm, and it hits Montag that it is his house that is burning on that day (Bradbury 106). The protagonist's boss reveals that it is Montag's wife that had turned him in by selecting to preserve her life over the loyalty to the husband (Bradbury 111). Once Montag burns down his home as per the instructions of the boss, the boss hits him on the head and dislodges the earbud that Montag has been using in communicating with professor Faber (Bradbury 112). Captain Beatty swears to hunt down Faber. The author uses Beatty as Montag's nemesis in the story.\nThe falling action happens when the conflict unravels with the main character either winning or losing against the antagonist. The falling action in this novel occurs when the idea of catching down Faber pissed off Montag and turns the hose to his nemesis and burns Beatty to death. Montag then runs away from the Mechanical Hound and the authorities and heads to the countryside. The play here reveals that antagonist of the story is dead and the plot of the story is filled with suspense. It is at this point that he meets a group of intellectuals such as Granger and they make a decision to rebuild the society.\nResolution consists of actions at the end of the falling action and highlights typically the end of the story where there is the creation of normality for the characters. The novel resolutions start when Montag meets the Granger and his friends who teach him. He comes to learn that all these men have books in their heads as they used their minds to store the information of the burned books (Bradbury 144). These individuals teach him how to recite the books as well in hopes that he would reproduce the written works one day. Montag later in rebuilds a literate civilization.\nFahrenheit 451 is a significant work of literature as it portrays the results of society without knowledge. The author of the book uses all the necessary steps of a narrative structure to develop an excellent plot of the book.\nBradbury, Ray. Fahrenheit 451.

{"text":"Proteins are the workhorses of the cell, controlling just about each response inside in addition to offering construction and serving as indicators to different cells. Proteins are lengthy chains of amino acids , and the precise sequence of the amino acids determines the ultimate construction and performance of the protein. Directions for that sequence are encoded in genes . To make a selected protein, a messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) copy is comprised of the gene (within the course of known as transcription ), and the mRNA is transported to the ribosome . Protein synthesis, additionally known as translation , begins when the 2 ribosomal subunits hyperlink onto the mRNA. This step, known as initiation, is adopted by elongation, by which successive amino acids are added to the rising chain, introduced in by switch RNAs (tRNAs). On this step, the ribosome reads the nucleotides of mRNA three by three, in models known as codons , and matches every to a few nucleotides on the tRNA, known as the anticodon. Lastly, throughout termination, the ribosome unbinds from the mRNA, and the amino acid chain goes on to be processed and folded to make the ultimate, useful protein.\nIn step one, initiation, the ribosome should bind the mRNA and discover the suitable place to begin translating it to make the protein. If the ribosome begins translating the mRNA within the flawed place, the flawed protein will likely be synthesized. This can be a significantly tough drawback as a result of there are three totally different studying frames by which an mRNA will be learn. Every unit of the genetic code , known as a codon, is made up of three bases and codes for one amino acid. Utterly totally different protein sequences will likely be learn out by the ribosome if it begins translating with the beginning of the primary codon at base 0, base 1, or base 2 (Determine 1). Thus, it\u2019s simple to see why the ribosome will need to have a approach to discover the right start line for translating every totally different mRNA.\nIn virtually each identified case, translation begins on the three-base codon that codes for the amino acid methionine. This codon has the sequence AUG. Ribosomes are made up of two elements, known as subunits, that include each protein and RNA elements. It\u2019s the job of the smaller ribosomal subunit to find the AUG codon that will likely be used as the start line for translation (known as the initiation codon). Though at all times beginning at AUG helps clear up the studying body drawback, discovering the proper AUG isn\u2019t a completely simple process. There\u2019s usually a couple of AUG codon in an mRNA, and the small ribosomal subunit should discover the right one if the proper protein is to be made.\nInitiation in Prokaryotes. In prokaryotes (micro organism) there\u2019s a nucleotide sequence on the upstream (5-prime, or 5\u2032) aspect of the initiation codon that tells the ribosome that the following AUG sequence is the right place to begin translating the mRNA. This sequence known as the Shine-Delgarno sequence, after its discoverers. The Shine-Delgarno sequence varieties base pairs with RNA within the small ribosomal subunit, thus binding the ribosomal subunit to the mRNA close to the initiation codon.\nSubsequent, a particular tRNA varieties base pairs with the AUG sequence of the initiation codon. The tRNA comprises the complementary sequence to AUG\nas its anticodon. This tRNA carries a modified model of the amino acid methionine (fMet-tRNAi or formylmethionyl initiator tRNA) and is already sure to the small ribosomal subunit. The interplay of codon and anti-codon triggers a sequence of occasions that isn\u2019t totally understood however that ends in the becoming a member of of the big ribosomal subunit to the small ribosomal subunit. The ensuing advanced known as an initiation advanced; it\u2019s a complete ribosome sure to an mRNA and an initiator tRNA, positioned in order to make the right protein from the mRNA.\nInitiation in Eukaryotes. In eukaryotes (animals, vegetation, fungi, and protists), the Shine-Delgarno sequence is lacking from the small ribosomal subunit\u2019s RNA, and thus a unique mechanism is used for finding the initiation codon. The technique employed by eukaryotes is extra advanced and fewer nicely understood than that utilized by prokaryotes. In eukaryotes, the small ribosomal subunit is assumed to bind to the 5\u2032 finish of the mRNA. This binding is mediated by a particular construction on the 5\u2032 finish of eukaryotic mRNAs known as a 7-methylguanosine cap and can be aided by a particular tail of adenosine bases (the poly-A tail) on the three\u2032 finish, each of that are added throughout RNA processing. A gaggle of proteins known as initiation components binds to the 7-methyl-guanosine cap and poly(A) tail and seems to direct the binding of the small ribosomal subunit to the mRNA close to the cap construction.\nAs soon as this has occurred, the small ribosomal subunit can learn alongside the mRNA and search for an AUG codon, a course of known as scanning. Recognition of the initiation codon is basically mediated by base-pairing interactions between the AUG codon and the anticodon sequence in a methionyl initiator tRNA (Met-tRNAi; the methionine isn\u2019t modified with a formyl group in eukaryotes as it\u2019s in prokaryotes ). As in prokaryotes, this Met-tRNA is already sure to the small ribosomal subunit.\nUsually, the primary AUG codon in a eukaryotic mRNA is used because the initiation codon, thus the small subunit locates the right initiation codon just by scanning alongside the mRNA beginning on the 5\u2032 finish till it reaches the primary AUG codon. Nevertheless, the initiation AUG codon could also be flanked by sure base sequences not discovered round different AUG codons not used for initiation. This most well-liked set of bases across the initiation codon known as the Kozak sequence, named after its discoverer, Marilyn Kozak. How the Kozak sequence helps direct the small ribosomal subunit to make use of one AUG codon as an alternative of one other isn\u2019t identified. As is the case in prokaryotes, as soon as the right AUG codon has been discovered, a posh sequence of steps takes place that ends in the becoming a member of of the big ribosomal subunit to the small ribosomal subunit to provide an initiation advanced: an entire ribosome assembled on the appropriate place on an mRNA with an initiator tRNA sure to it.\nIn each prokaryotes and eukaryotes there are proteins known as initiation components which can be required for the right meeting of an initiation advanced. In prokaryotes there are three initiation components, logically sufficient known as IF1, IF2, and IF3. IF2 helps the fMet-tRNAi bind to the small ribosomal subunit. IF3\u2019s most important position seems to be to make sure that an AUG, and never one other codon, is used because the beginning website of translation. That\u2019s, IF3 displays the constancy of the collection of the initiation codon. IF1 seems to stop the initiator tRNA from binding to the flawed place within the small ribosomal subunit.\nIn eukaryotes, the scenario is significantly extra advanced, with not less than twenty-four protein elements required for the initiation course of.\nThe antibiotic tetracycline prevents tRNA from binding to the A websites.\nWithin the subsequent section of protein synthesis, elongation, the ribosome joins amino acids collectively within the sequence decided by the mRNA to make the corresponding protein. Amino acids are introduced onto the ribosome hooked up to tRNAs. tRNAs are the adapter molecules that enable the ribosome to translate the data contained within the codon sequence of the mRNA into the amino acid sequence of a protein. This decoding occurs by base pairing between the anticodon bases of the tRNA and the codon bases of the mRNA. When all three anticodon bases of the tRNA type base pairs with the following codon of the mRNA, the ribosome, with the help of an elongation issue protein, acknowledges that this tRNA has the right amino acid hooked up to it and provides this amino acid to the rising protein chain. The method can then be repeated till the complete protein has been synthesized.\nAs simply talked about, elongation requires the assistance of elongation issue proteins. The tRNAs with hooked up amino acids (known as aminoacyl tRNAs) are introduced onto the ribosome by one such elongation issue. This issue known as EF-Tu in prokaryotes and EF1 in eukaryotes. Its job is to deliver aminoacyl tRNAs onto the ribosome after which to assist the ribosome be sure that this tRNA has the right amino acid hooked up to it. The ribosome has three aminoacyl tRNA binding websites: the acceptor website (A), the peptidyl website (P), and the exit website (E). The tRNA that has the rising protein hooked up to it binds within the P website (therefore the title peptidyl, for peptide). The incoming aminoacyl tRNA, containing the following amino acid to be added, binds within the A website. The A website is the place decoding of the genetic code takes place; the right aminoacyl tRNA is chosen to match the following codon of the mRNA. Spent tRNAs that not have an amino acid or the rising peptide chain hooked up to them find yourself within the E website, from\nwhich they fall off the ribosome again into the cytoplasm , the place they\u2019ll choose up new amino acids.\nAs soon as the A website is occupied by the right tRNA, the ribosome hyperlinks the brand new amino acid to the rising peptide chain. It does this by catalyzing the formation of a peptide (amide) bond between the amino (NH2) group of the brand new amino acid within the A website and the carbonyl (CO) group that attaches the rising protein chain to the tRNA within the P website (Determine 2). This ends in an intermediate state of the ribosome, known as a hybrid state, by which the tRNA within the P website has misplaced the rising protein chain and moved partially into the E website, and the tRNA within the A website now has the rising protein chain hooked up to it and has moved partially into the P website.\nTo finish the spherical of elongation, a second elongation issue, known as EF-G in prokaryotes and EF2 in eukaryotes, is required. This elongation issue strikes the tRNAs such that the spent tRNA that has misplaced the protein chain strikes totally into the E website, and the tRNA with the rising protein chain strikes totally into the P website. The mRNA can be shifted over one codon by EF-G, in order that the following codon is within the A website. The A website is now empty of tRNAs and the following aminoacyl tRNA will be introduced into it.\nMany antibiotics (medicine that kill micro organism) have an effect on the elongation section of prokaryotic translation. Some lower the constancy (accuracy) with which the ribosome decodes the mRNA and the flawed amino acids get put into the proteins. This lower in constancy results in an accumulation of proteins that don\u2019t work, which ultimately kills the bacterium. Different antibiotics stop the formation of the peptide bond or the motion of the tRNAs by EF-G after the peptide bond has been fashioned. The explanation these medicine are efficient on micro organism with out killing the affected person is that prokaryotic ribosomes have some totally different structural options than eukaryotic ribosomes, and thus these medicine can bind to the prokaryotic (bacterial) ribosomes however not the eukaryotic (that\u2019s, human) ribosomes. Since viruses use human ribosomes to breed, these antibiotics are usually not efficient in opposition to them.\nThe top of the code for the protein within the mRNA is signaled by one in every of three particular codons known as cease codons. These cease codons have the sequences\nUAA, UAG, and UGA. In prokaryotes, the cease codons are sure by one in every of two launch issue proteins (RFs) in prokaryotes: RF1 or RF2. These launch components trigger the ribosome to cleave the completed protein off the tRNA within the P website. A 3rd launch issue, RF3, is chargeable for releasing RF1 and RF2 from the ribosome after they\u2019ve acknowledged the cease codon and triggered the protein to be cleaved off the tRNA. Eukaryotes seem to have one protein, eRF1, that performs the capabilities of RF1 and RF2, and a second protein, eRF3, that performs the operate of RF3. As soon as launched, the protein can then go on to carry out its operate within the cell.\nAfter the protein has been cleaved off the tRNA, the 2 ribosomal subunits should be dissociated from each other in order that the ribosome can begin translating one other mRNA. This course of known as recycling. In prokaryotes, recycling requires three proteins: one initiation issue (IF3), one elongation issue (EF-G), and a ribosome recycling issue known as RRF. As soon as the subunits are dissociated from one another the entire technique of translation can start once more.\nA useful protein isn\u2019t an extended, stretched-out chain of amino acids however fairly a posh, three-dimensional construction. That\u2019s, every protein should fold up into a selected form, or conformation , with a view to carry out its operate within the cell. The proof strongly means that the entire info required for the protein to fold into its appropriate three-dimensional construction is contained within the amino acid sequence of the protein (fairly than, say, being decided by another issue within the cell). Nevertheless, because the protein is being synthesized on the ribosome there\u2019s a hazard that the unfinished protein will start to fold up incorrectly as a result of the remainder of the protein has not but been made. It is usually potential that the unfinished protein will work together with different unfinished proteins being made on different ribosomes and type what known as an combination : a community of partially folded proteins which have interacted with one another fairly than with themselves, thus producing a large number contained in the cell. Such protein aggregates will be deadly for the cell. It\u2019s the job of a category of proteins known as chaperones to bind to the rising protein chains as they\u2019re synthesized by ribosomes and forestall aggregates from forming or the proteins from folding incorrectly earlier than they\u2019ve been totally synthesized. Chaperones might also assist proteins effectively fold up into the right three-dimensional construction as soon as translation is full.\nProtein Modification \u2013 \u201cprotein synthesis facts\u201d\nWhereas the mRNA encodes the entire amino acid sequence of the corresponding protein, some proteins are altered after they\u2019re translated. This course of known as post-translational modification. For instance, some proteases (proteins that digest different proteins) are synthesized by the ribosome as precursor proteins (pro-proteins) that include an additional sequence of amino acids at one finish that stops them from digesting any proteins till they get to the proper place (normally exterior of the cell). As soon as the proteases attain their vacation spot, the amino acid sequences that stop them from being energetic (known as pro-sequences) are eliminated (by one other protein), and the proteases can start digesting different proteins. If these pro-sequences didn\u2019t exist,\nthe proteases would digest the entire helpful proteins contained in the cells that made them\u2014which might not be a superb factor.\nMany proteins made by eukaryotic cells are modified by having sugars hooked up to varied amino acids, a course of known as glycosylation. Proteins which can be destined to be exported from the cell or are going to be inserted into the cell\u2019s membrane enter the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) as they\u2019re synthesized by ribosomes that bind to the floor of the ER and feed the brand new proteins into the ER by small pores. Contained in the ER, sugars are added to the protein, which is then despatched to the Golgi equipment the place a number of the sugars are eliminated and extra sugars are added. The position of protein glycosylation isn\u2019t nicely understood, however as a result of many euykaryotic proteins are glycosylated, it\u2019s clearly vital.\nThere are a variety of further ways in which proteins will be modified after they\u2019re made. For instance, many proteins can have a number of phosphate teams added to them by enzymes known as kinases . These phosphorylations are sometimes utilized by the cell to control the exercise of particular proteins; the phosphorylated type of the protein usually has totally different properties than the unphosphorylated type.\nWhen a protein has outlived its usefulness or turn out to be broken, it\u2019s degraded by the cell. In eukaryotes, a protein that\u2019s to be degraded has various copies of the small protein ubiquitin hooked up to it by a sequence of ubiquitin-adding enzymes. Ubiquitin serves as a tag that marks the protein for degradation. A tagged protein is then sucked into a big mobile machine known as the proteasome, which itself is made up of various protein elements and appears one thing like a trash can. Contained in the proteasome, the tagged protein is digested into small peptide fragments which can be launched into the cytoplasm the place they are often additional digested into free amino acids by different proteases. The lifetime of a protein begins in a single mobile machine known as the ribosome and ends in one other known as the proteasome.\nsee additionally Endoplasmic Reticulum; Genetic Code; Golgi; Protein Construction; Ribosome; RNA; RNA Processing\nLewin, Benjamin.

{"text":"Characteristics of a Historian\nBy the end of Year 6, a historian in the Three Rivers Federation will understand and explain key events in ancient and modern history, particularly ones that have shaped society and Britain. They will understand how events in the past shape, influence, impact and make the present. Pupils will have a sense of who we are and why we are the way we are as a nation. They will be able to interpret and analyse sources skillfully and be confident to question history and different perspectives of it, in order to build their own understanding of events.\nStoke Canon C of E Primary School\u2019s History Curriculum design intends to celebrate the rich history of our local area. History units are informed by the National Curriculum and intend to provide pupils with a detailed knowledge and understanding of local, regional, national and international history and how these past events influence, impact and make the present. Pupils are encouraged to contextualise history in their locality; using resources within the immediate and wider locality enables pupils at Stoke Canon C of E Primary School to develop a deep understanding of the history of their locality and compare and contrast their lives with those of the past.\nConsequently, pupils will develop a coherent chronological narrative and understand how their locality and the wider world has changed over time, what has caused societies and places to be the way they are, and identify similarities and differences between different historical periods.\nThe History Curriculum at Stoke Canon C of E Primary School is carefully designed to inspire pupils\u2019 curiosity to know about the past and ensure for development and progression in learning. Our curriculum design follows an enquiry-based approach to learning. This approach is intended to model how to be \u2018historians\u2019 and thus, how to ask, explore and critically evaluate historically valid questions, using a range of sources\nHistorians at Stoke Canon C of E Primary School embark upon three history units per academic year, developing a rich and chronologically secure knowledge of local, national and world history. Each unit is comprised of a series of enquiry questions to guide learning and spark curiosity. These enquiry questions follow two themes: \u2018Daily Life\u2019 and \u2018Rule of Law\u2019. As a school, we believe the theme of \u2018Daily Life\u2019 is relatable to pupils and is a theme interwoven throughout any historical period. The theme \u2018Rule of Law\u2019 enables pupils to develop a rich and deep knowledge and understanding of how societies are governed. As a result, the themes of \u2018Daily Life\u2019 and \u2018Rule of Law\u2019 are addressed in every year group, providing a continuous thread for pupils to follow, refer to and build upon. Retaining these themes enables pupils to draw connections between different time periods, historical eras and events and clearly identify similarities and differences to understand their place in the world. We have identified the key knowledge and skills in our curriculum and consideration has been given to ensure progression\nacross topics in each year group.\nThe local area is fully utilised to achieve the desired outcomes, with extensive opportunities for learning outside the classroom embedded in practice such as visits to the Iron Age fort at Killerton House and Gardens and Exeter's City Centre.\nThe Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS) follows the \u2018Development Matters in the EYFS\u2019 guidance which aims for all children in reception to have an \u2018Understanding of the World; people and communities, the world and technology\u2019 by the end of the academic year.\nAs a school, we use a range of knowledge retrieval practices for pupils to acquire, identify and develop key knowledge about each unit of historical enquiry. Various strategies of assessment for learning take place at the start and end of each unit: at the end of each unit, pupils are encouraged to record and reflect upon what they have learned comparative to their starting points. Additionally, pupils review the agreed successes at the end of every session and are actively encouraged to identify their own target areas, with support from their teachers. Outcomes of learning and evident in pupils\u2019 history books.\nPupils are encouraged to think critically and analytically about different interpretations of historic events and how sources can provide an insight to our past. Pupils\u2019 curiosity is fostered through the encouragement of pupils raising historically valid and perceptive questions and devise ways to find answers\nCharacteristics of a Geographer in Year 6\nA Geographer from the Three Rivers Federation will:\n- be curious and inquisitive about the world around them, including its physical and human geography\n- be able to form and express well-balanced ideas and opinions about the world, which are rooted in good knowledge and understanding of societal and environmental issues\n- to be confident using fieldwork and other geographical skills to develop an understanding of their locality and how their locality sits within the country, the continent and the wider world.\nAt Stoke Canon C of E Primary School children are encouraged to develop a greater understanding and knowledge of the world, as well as their place in it. The geography curriculum at Stoke Canon C of E Primary School enables children to develop knowledge and skills that are transferable to other curriculum areas. Geography is, by nature, an investigative subject, which develops and understanding of concepts, knowledge and skills. We seek to inspire in children a curiosity and fascination about the world and its people ; to promote the children\u2019s interest and understanding of diverse places, people, resources and natural and human environments, together with a deep understanding of the Earth\u2019s key physical and human processes. We make the most of our local area with visits including around Stoke Canon e.g. children walk around the village looking at land use, the local river Exe and Culm, visits to Exeter, Dartmoor and Exmouth.\nGeography is taught as a discrete subject and we have identified the key knowledge and skills of each topic and consideration has been given to ensure progression across topics throughout each year group across the school. At the beginning of each topic, children are able to convey what they know already as well as what they would like to find out. This informs future study and also ensures that lessons are relevant and take account of children\u2019s different starting points. Consideration is given to how greater depth will be taught, learnt and demonstrated within each lesson, as well as how learners will be supported in line with the school\u2019s commitment to inclusion.\nOutcomes in topic and literacy books, evidence a broad and balanced geography curriculum and demonstrate children\u2019s acquisition of identified key knowledge. Children review their successes in achieving the lesson objectives at the end of every session and through retrieval practice. As children progress throughout the school, they develop a deep knowledge, understanding an appreciation of their local area and its place within the wider geographical context.\nHistory and Geography work is recorded in topic books and should reflect examples of all four strands (chronological awareness, knowledge and understanding, historical concepts and organise, evaluate and communicate information). Some of the evidence will involve photographic evidence or teacher\u2019s notes where the activity has been one of discussion or drama.\nTeachers assess children\u2019s knowledge, understanding and skills in History by making observations within class and by analysis of their written evidence. As part of our assessment for learning process (and in line with our school\u2019s assessment policy), children will receive both verbal and written feedback as a means of development. The Curriculum Leader provides feedback to staff in order to inform and improve future practice.","metadata":{"date":1708503950000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947473401.5\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240221070402-20240221100402-00598.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9506816864,"token_count":1533,"url":"https:\/\/www.stokecanon.net\/humanities\/"},"score":4,"id":"471"}

{"text":"I was walking my dogs in the woods yesterday evening when a notification popped up on my phone that Steve Cohen had reached an agreement to buy the Mets. Yesterday was a pretty tough day for me. I'm working my way back from back surgery, and have been overdoing things more than a little, in my own stubborn way. I was pretty tired and still had a couple of miles back to my car when the news came in. I felt a bolt of electricity pass through my body along with an unexpected amount of emotion. This news had been a long time coming.\nFred Wilpon first intruded into my consciousness in January 1980 when he was a small minority part of the purchase of the club from the heirs of Joan Payson. Doubleday & Co. Publishing owned the lion's share of the club. The club slowly improved thanks to the hiring of GM Frank Cashen. Fred only owned five percent of the team, and Jeff wasn't even in the picture yet.\nThe resurgence of the club in that era culminated on October 27, 1986 - a week after my 28th birthday - when the Mets won their last World Series. The engraving on the trophy had barely cooled off when, less than a month later, Fred Wilpon and Nelson Doubleday bought the team from the publishing company and became 50-50 partners. It's been downhill since then, literally. The 1986 Mets were the best club in team history, and there really hasn't been a Mets team that was close to as good and as balanced as that championship team was.\nThe 90s were a bit of a horror show, but the decade culminated in a really fun team under manager Bobby Valentine. It didn't last long, however. The 2001 Mets were mediocre, and the 2002 Mets were a last-place team again. Late in the season, Wilpon bought out Doubleday, with the latter convinced that he wasn't treated fairly. Fred and Jeff were a father-and-son team of incompetence at that point. What we didn't know then, but would find out later, was that much of the money that was spent on the team in those years was financed by Bernie Madoff's pyramid scheme.\nThe consequences of that quickly became apparent when that house of cards came down in December 2008. The Mets' finances were irretrievably diminished, but Fred Wilpon's friendship with Bud Selig led to Fred and Jeff hanging on for an extra decade, with depressingly predictable results.\nThere have been a few short-lived periods of success over the years, but it's pretty fair to say that the more control the Wilpon family had over this team, the worse it's been for Mets fans. Only the presence of James Dolan in town saved them from being the undisputed worst team owner in New York, but that's only because Jimmy was able to screw up 2 teams.\nWatching the Wilpon family doing a poor job of running the team was hard. The fact that their actions often made the club a laughingstock made it all that much harder. They made a lot of stupid mistakes, but you have to give them credit, they never seemed to learn from any of them. That Jeff Wilpon had an over-inflated sense of his self-worth and an almost total inability to stop rubbing most of the people who had to deal with him the wrong way was one of the worst-kept secrets in New York. Yet Fred seemed to be blind to his son's shortcomings, or perhaps he was just arrogant enough not to care.\nNone of us can claim to know what Steve Cohen might do once he takes over in November. I'm in the process of writing some pieces on what I might do if I were the lucky multi-billionaire to purchase the team. It's fun to do, and I have no shortage of opinions on the matter, but I am under no delusions that Cohen will do most of the things I come up with. He's a cipher to most of us at this point. We have real hopes that the keen mind that has made billions for himself over the years will implement the kind of structural changes needed to turn this organization into a consistent winner. He doesn't seem to be a huge attention seeker, which is good, because if he makes the right decisions in who he hires and what they implement, we'll be paying more attention to the team than to him.\nI think my friend Greg Prince makes a pretty strong point about this stage of the relationship between Mets fans and their new owner:\n\u201cWe\u2019ll all see our own ink blot when we look at Steve Cohen taking charge and imagine our own version of Metsian nirvana. The reality has little chance of matching exactly our wildest wishes, but we\u2019re probably going to like the net Met effect.\u201d https:\/\/t.co\/S7MjZYJaNn\u2014 Greg Prince (@greg_prince) September 15, 2020\nNot being Wilpon is a great start for Cohen. As for the rest of it, only time will reveal that. I know I'm looking forward to getting to know the new owner better by watching the moves that he makes. As the Mets' last season under Wilpon ownership draws down to a last dreary, pathetic anticlimax, there is a reason to look forward with some genuine hope.\nPlease stay safe, be well and take care. And smile. For the first time in a very, very long time, it feels like a good time to be a Mets fan.\nFollow me on Twitter @MikeSteffanos","metadata":{"date":1709216355000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947474843.87\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240229134901-20240229164901-00098.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9865307212,"token_count":1153,"url":"https:\/\/www.mikesmets.com\/2020\/09\/that-feeling-when.html"},"score":1,"id":"473"}

{"text":"Vector-borne diseases \u2013 illnesses that can be transmitted to humans by other living organisms such as mosquitoes and ticks \u2013 account for more than 17% of all infectious disease and cause more than 700,000 deaths globally each year. They include West Nile virus, malaria, dengue and yellow fever.\nAs outlined in our Health Effects of Climate Change (HECC) report, the health risks posed by mosquitoes and ticks in the UK, whether from established or invasive species, are directly impacted by climate change and warming temperatures.\nAt UKHSA, our dedicated teams of medical entomologists monitor and assess the incursion of new species and diseases which could cause harm to human health, playing a vital role in coordinating efforts to minimise emerging vector-borne threats.\nIn this blog post, we take a look at the current status of vector-borne diseases in the UK, as well as the vital work being carried out by our specialist entomology team to assess, understand and address the health threats that mosquitoes and ticks pose.\nWhat are disease vectors?\nVectors, such as ticks and mosquitoes, are living organisms that can transmit infectious pathogens between humans, or from animals to humans. In the UK the threat from vector-borne diseases is on the rise, due to factors like growing global travel and trade, changes in land use and climate change.\nMosquitoes with the potential to transmit infectious disease can make their way to our shores in a number of ways, such as hitching a ride in cars and lorries, crossing the border into the UK. They may also be transported through trade channels through goods such as tyres, which are shipped internationally.\nSimilarly, ticks not commonly found in the UK can attach themselves to pets migratory birds and holidaymakers in search of a blood meal and be imported into the UK.\nAs temperatures warm, tick and mosquito species not currently native to the UK will begin to find the UK\u2019s climate more bearable making it easier for them to survive, reproduce and establish a local population.\nWhat is UKHSA doing about vector-borne disease?\nOur Medical Entomology and Zoonoses Ecology (MEZE) team assess the emerging risk posed by ticks, mosquitoes and other arthropods that can carry and transmit bacteria, viruses and parasites. An important part of their remit is to advise the government on the risk to public health from vector-borne disease in the UK.\nOur entomologists also work with local authorities to monitor and manage risks, and to put in place strategies to minimise the opportunity for invasive species to become established in our towns and countryside.\nMosquitoes: where are they found in the UK?\nThe following locations are known to have active mosquito populations:\nThe coastal marshes of Southeast England\nCharacterised by their wetlands, bodies of water and marshy habitats, the North Kent Marshes are an ideal breeding ground for mosquitoes and have been for decades, if not centuries.\nIn these Marshes and at similar sites across the country, our teams have been conducting surveillance over the last decade using a range of mosquito traps and dip for larvae in water sources, to assess the presence or absence of a species locally, their seasonality and collect specimens for viral analysis.\nEnsuring our awareness of and preparedness for diseases such as West Nile virus (WNV) risk involves conducting these types of surveillance for mosquitoes at key parts of the year to identify presence of key mosquito species as vectors of future disease risk.\nCulex modestus, a species of mosquito and a primary carrier of WNV in countries where the disease is common, is known to occur in the North Kent Marshes and other coastal marshes in Southeast England could in future be one such disease risk. At present WNV is yet to make a foothold in these areas, but in recent years areas of Europe, including France, have experienced several outbreaks in the summer and early autumn months.\nMotorway service stations\nTransport hubs, such as motorway service stations and truck stops, are ideal sites at which in-depth data can be gathered on the detection of invasive mosquito species brought into the country in lorries and other vehicles.\nIf imported goods or vehicles carrying mosquitoes reach the UK, they could establish a local population. Motorway service stations, showing evidence of eggs or larvae, could be the first sign of a potentially established population in the UK.\nMonitoring whether vehicles are bringing in invasive mosquitoes at these types of transport hubs is therefore important, as we can detect and eradicate them before they are disseminated more widely.\nThe most common mosquito species found in the UK, Culex pipiens, is adept at surviving in urban and suburban areas \u2013 breeding in various types of water sources, including artificial containers and stagnant water.\nCollaborating with local authorities, mosquito traps targeting invasive species are run at high-risk sites across England. Left unchecked the consequences of not controlling these species can lead to the establishment of this invasive vector and therefore potential for new diseases that we have not seen in the UK.\nCoordinated by our teams, local authorities and communities are being encouraged to step into action in these instances and clear out sources of standing and stagnant water such as blocked gutters and drains, and ensure rainwater in litter, tarpaulin, open buckets, bins and discarded items are cleared away or arranged in a way that they drain away.\nWhen surveillance systems identify an invasive species aggressive interventions are put in place to eradicate any health threat. These mosquito control efforts may include reducing mosquito breeding sites, using insecticides, and promoting personal protective measures like wearing long-sleeved clothing, using mosquito repellents to the public and alerting local healthcare settings to the signs of illness to look out for.\nTicks live in many different outdoor environments, but they are particularly common in grassy and wooded areas. To better understand the threat they pose to public health, our team is studying tick populations in several locations, including:\nThe UK has over 20 recorded tick species, and our teams undertake tick sampling at a number of sites across the country in order to study local species diversity, distribution patterns, host preferences, factors determining population abundance and whether any vector-borne pathogens are present in local populations.\nLearning more about our local tick populations helps our teams and local authorities to develop strategies to mitigate the risks associated with tick-borne diseases, understand the disease profile of local ticks and potentially manage exposure of humans to tick populations.\nThe survival of our current species, and of those potentially invasive to the UK is determined by microclimate, habitat and available hosts, all of which can be impacted by climate change. These determinates can also increase cases of diseases like tick-borne encephalitis and babesiosis which are rare in humans in the UK, but common elsewhere in Europe.\nThrough a process known as flagging, where a cloth sheet is pulled through grass catching ticks questing for blood, our teams collect samples to take back to the lab for analysis.\nThrough learning more about the distribution and abundance of ticks in these areas we can work with local authorities to better place control measures and tick awareness which will reduce the risk of tick-borne diseases.\nAssessing risk of ticks to UK public health through national surveillance schemes is integral to the team\u2019s ability to coordinate research which looks at ecological drivers of pathogens which cause the spread of diseases like Lyme disease or tick-borne encephalitis. Through enhanced surveillance, our Rare and Imported Pathogens Laboratory (RIPL) collect data on recent positive cases of Lyme, looking at where and when a person may have picked up an infection.\nDuring April, May and June the MEZE team receive submissions to the tick surveillance scheme, receiving thousands of samples from the public, vets, GP surgeries and wildlife charities. These submissions provide valuable data on the distribution and activity of ticks across the country.\nThese submissions peak in June, at the height of tick season when the climate is most favourable and gives the team a real sense on any seasonal changes \u2013 improving our ability to detect any invasive species, update risk assessments on outbreaks, and prepare responses such as habitat management or targeted human or animal surveillance.\nBack at our Porton lab the team get up-close and personal with the ticks and mosquitoes they\u2019ve collected, or ticks submitted through surveillance schemes, under the microscope.\nHere the team will confirm the species, where they are at in terms of the different stages of their life-cycle and look for any species which are not native to the UK.\nCombined datasets for ticks have been collected since 2005, and they provide the best assessment of where ticks are causing human and animal biting in the UK. This information has allowed us to map changes over nearly two decades.\nThrough studying the lifecycle and development of ticks and mosquitoes in relation to our weather and climate, the MEZE team can work with modellers to create projections of scenarios for potential seasonal changes to tick and mosquito populations. These studies will help to understand when shifts in breeding and feeding patterns might occur, potential increases of incidence of diseases such as Lyme disease and estimate changes in geographical distribution.\nThe impact of climate change\nThe HECC report demonstrates substantial and growing evidence of the effects of climate change on health in the UK.\nThe impact that climate change could have on vector-borne diseases and our society, if we do not take decisive action, could have major impacts on physical and mental health.\nConsidering and monitoring the impact of climate and other environmental change in relation to vector-borne diseases through our surveillance systems is vital to our countries ability to safeguard future generations from the increasing threat from diseases such as tick-borne encephalitis, or chikungunya from invasive mosquitoes.\nView original article\nContributor: Blog Editor","metadata":{"date":1708949052000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947474659.73\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240226094435-20240226124435-00298.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9480885267,"token_count":1998,"url":"http:\/\/health-topic.com\/2023\/12\/12\/health-effects-of-climate-change-the-health-threat-from-vector-borne-diseases\/"},"score":3,"id":"476"}
{"text":"Google Analytics has changed from Universal Analytics to Google Analytics 4 this past summer, 2023. Digital marketers and data and reporting professionals have transitioned from one platform to the next and have learned how to navigate the different features this new platform brings. One of the main differences between Universal Analytics and Google Analytics 4 is the events. Universal originally had conversions that users would manually set up to track different user interactions on the website. But now, with events, there are new features GA4 can bring, allowing data reporters to follow more about the user and their experience on a website. Learn more about what an event is in GA4 and how it can be used to track a user\u2019s journey across your website.\nWhat is An Event in GA4?\nAn event in GA4 is a user\u2019s interaction with a website or their action to complete a conversion. This includes tracking a user who watches a video, clicks on a specific page, clicks to call the business, fills out a contact form, and much more. Events can be marked as conversions for particular actions that a website owner or digital marketer would want to know about their user. They are written using an underscore in between words on GA4. Event tags previously had to be set up in Google Tag Manager with Universal Analytics. With GA4, digital marketers can see all events in analytics and include them in their reports.\nWhat Are The Different Types of Events?\nThere are four types of events: web events, app events, app+web events, and Android events. Web events are recorded only on the website and are known for event names such as page_view, file_donwload, scroll, etc. App events are recorded only on a mobile app. These examples are notification_open, screen_view, in_app_purchase, etc. App+web events are events that can be recorded on both app and web. These include first_visit, user_engagemenet, session_start, etc. Lastly, android events are events that are only recorded from an Android device. These events include app_remove, app_clear_data, app_store_purchase, etc.\nGoogle Analytics Help and SEO Services\nBoston Web Marketing is here to help businesses with Google Analytics 4 and create custom events and conversions. If you want to take your business to new heights, our SEO services are designed to help you get there. Not only is it important to get found on search engines like Google, but having those users turn into customers is what we\u2019re here for.

{"text":"Being a motorcycle owner, is it important to know why are motorcycle tire treads opposite? I am sure a lot of us do.\nThe design pattern of tire treads does have a major role to play. Such pattern is not designed to attract more customers and increase sales as some people might think.\nOn the contrary, tire tread patterns have a lot to do with the traction and stability factors of a motorbike. These factors are directly linked to a motorcycle owner\u2019s safety.\nNot only this but knowing about tire tread patterns will also help you know about the difference and relevance between the front and rear tires.\nLooking to learn more about it? Keep reading!\nWhy are motorcycle tire treads opposite?\nMotorcycle tire treads are designed in the opposite direction on front and rear tires to provide proper grip, stability, and better traction.\nNormally, the front tires of a motorcycle are designed with inverted tread patterns. Such tread design is helpful in creating appropriate contact with the road surface.\nProper contact is helpful in scattering the debris, dirt, and water away in dry conditions and dispersing the rainwater from the contact patch in wet conditions.\nSimilarly, the rear tires of a motorcycle carry an outward tread pattern to improve the traction levels while accelerating, decelerating, and cornering.\nThe outward tread pattern also helps reduce the risk of hydroplaning by allowing to dissipate the water between the tire and the road.\nSome of the other reasons for the opposite tread pattern are reduction of noise levels, durability, and minimum tire blowouts.\nLet\u2019s elaborate on these reasons further to understand the opposite treading patterns.\nBetter grip and stability\nAs we all know (assuming), motorcycle front tires are mainly responsible for braking and controlling the corners.\nThe tread patterns on front tires are designed keeping these aspects in mind. A majority of tires are stamped with V shape pattern with an incoming flow.\nThe design contains large grooves and channels so that it can throw away the on-road obstacles from sticking to the contact patch. This makes the grip of a tire more firmed and balanced with the road surface.\nThe effects of tread patterns are more beneficial in rainwater. When a motorcycle crosses through a road containing a bulk of water it leads to the building of a water layer between the wheels of the vehicle and the road surface. This is called Hydroplaning or Aquaplaning process.\nHere is a small video that will help you understand the impacts of a tread pattern in rainwater. Although it is a bicycle it doesn\u2019t change the direction and dissipation of water that takes place on motorcycle tires.\nThe aquaplaning process is responsible to create a gap between the tire and the road because of the thrust of water it generates below the leading edge of a tire.\nThis causes a loss of contact between the tire and the road making it skate with the flow of water rather than running.\nIf the tire has no contact with the road surface obviously a biker will not be able to control it even in the form of braking.\nIf the brakes are applied under these circumstances, in all likelihood a bike is bound to skid through instead of stopping because of the water layer.\nThis is where the grooves are designed on the front tires to dissipate the water away from the contact patch to keep the tires grounded and improve the grip and stability.\nBut then, why the rear tire treads are in the opposite direction? Are they protected from the hydroplaning or aquaplaning process? The answer is\u2026\nRear tires have an outward tread pattern that is helpful in improving the traction of a motorcycle.\nThe rear tires are obliged to accelerate the motorbike which keeps the wheels moving forward.\nThe shape of a motorcycle plays a prominent role here. The motorcycle is aerodynamically designed to absorb the airflow at higher speeds performed mainly by rear tires.\nThe force of air while speeding causes a motorcycle to feel the lift throughout its body and especially at the bottom. This is the reason when applying sudden brakes, you will see many bikers rising above the ground with rear wheels in the air.\nEven if the brakes are not applied, the flow of air will be felt around the feet and waist on a moving motorcycle that forces the top clothing of a motorcyclist to come out.\nSecondly, the rear tires of a motorcycle too keep the receding water at bay with the outward tread pattern. Here, the force of water is already dislodged by the front tires and whatever is left out is just pushed away by the rear tires.\nThe risk of hydroplaning is already taken care of by the inverted treading pattern of the front tires and so, the main act of the rear tires is to run through the half-dry corridor created by its front sibling.\nIf you have the same tread pattern as that of a front tire it will reduce the traction levels creating acceleration\/deceleration issues resulting in limited airflow tolerance.\nReduced noise levels\nThe inverted tread pattern of the front tire is helpful in reducing unwanted noise generated by the spinning of wheels.\nAs we now know an inverted tread pattern is instrumental in dispersing water, dirt, and other obstacles it is also capable of dissipating the air efficiently when the motorcycle is in motion.\nThe excessive airflow dampens the sound waves produced by the wheels while running. Additionally, an inverted tread pattern creates a larger contact patch with the road for better grip and handling which also keeps the noise under control.\nMinimum tire blowouts\nEliminated risk of aquaplaning\/hydroplaning is equal to eliminating risks of tire blowouts.\nIn order to keep the blowouts away, a tire needs to be run on balanced air pressure. One of the main causes of tires losing air is improper friction created by the gap between the tire and the road surface.\nRelated Read: Why do car tires explode?\nBy keeping the on-road debris, and water away inverted tread patterns help the tire maintain balanced contact with the road. Another reason for tire blowouts is overheating.\nAgain, the larger grooves and channels of the inverted tread patterns disperse the heat that gets built up within the tire due to over-speeding and continuous friction.\nWhen you have balanced air in the tires with proper friction\/contact with the road there is no doubt your motorcycle tires have a longer life.\nOne of the other reasons tread patterns are created on tires is to offer proper cushioning and stability to protect the vehicle from running vibrations.\nThe reversible tread patterns offer a harder grip which makes the tire stronger to face roadside difficulties. Hence, opposite tread patterns are responsible for a longer lifespan of tires.\nWe have seen the benefits of opposite tire treads and one cannot ignore the fact that tires with such patterns do look attractive.\nApart from the looks, opposite tread patterns give your motorcycle tires better grip, stability, performance, and more importantly increased durability.\nIf you are considering buying new tires for your motorcycle or are just curious to know about the tread patterns before buying then prefer the ones with opposite tread patterns.\nI hope you have understood the concept of the opposite tread pattern of motorcycle tires by reading this post.\nKeeping the concept in mind, never try to install the same tread pattern of tires to the front and rear side of your motorcycle as it may compromise the safety and security of your motorbike and your life.","metadata":{"date":1709234568000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947474852.83\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240229170737-20240229200737-00698.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9603763819,"token_count":1519,"url":"https:\/\/thecarplus.com\/why-are-motorcycle-tire-treads-opposite-5-important-facts-revealed\/"},"score":3,"id":"482"}

{"text":"A headache can be a constant source of annoyance, especially when one cannot figure out what\u2019s causing it. According to many health professionals, the tight and fixed positioning of the muscles for a long time is one of the main reasons people get a headache. Tightening of muscles can happen in the mouth, jaw and other surrounding areas. This indicates that dental stress can be a big contributor to headaches. You would refer to such pain as a dental headache.\nHere are five common causes of dental headaches:\n1) Mouth abscesses\nBacteria cause this infection, and people with poor oral hygiene are more likely to develop it. The infection also originates after an improper dental procedure by a dentist. An example of such a process is tooth extraction, which requires stretching your mouth. Stretching causes tension in the oral muscles and then results in a headache.\n2) Tooth infection\nSometimes the innermost pulp of the tooth gets infected. The pain can be unbearable and quite severe, causing your face and head to ache. Tooth infection mostly occurs because of poor dental hygiene that leads to the development of bacteria.\n3) Teeth grinding\nTeeth grinding is quite common in both children and adults. It is also a major dental problem that intensifies a headache. If someone grinds their teeth regularly, this can weaken their teeth structure. It can also result in the breaking of the tooth and other oral health issues. Teeth grinding requires excessive jaw movement, which is one of the main factors contributing to a headache.\n4) Muscle unevenness in your mouth\nThe shape of the teeth changes from time to time. As you grow old, the teeth structure starts to alter in terms of both shape and size. The jaw naturally adjusts to the shape and size alteration. However, in some cases, it can take a lot of time to get used to the growing of secondary teeth. Broken and chipped teeth can cause an unwanted shape alteration that makes it difficult for your muscles to adapt.\n5) Hard bites\nWhen taking a bite, the jaw muscles stretch. If an individual chews hard foods like candies, coconuts, etc., the muscles might take a bit longer to return their original positions. Thus, they have to ensure that they take regular bites and avoid eating things that require more effort from their teeth.\nYou might be wondering:\nDental headaches are quite common and can happen to anyone. There are specific treatment plans people can use to get over such health issues. They should follow a diet consisting of softer foods. Moreover, they should also avoid sleeping on hard surfaces and should clean their teeth regularly if they think they have a dental headache. In case of severe pain and other extreme oral health issues, patients should immediately consult a dentist for further guidance.\nCheck out what others are saying about our services on Yelp: Read our Yelp reviews.","metadata":{"date":1708592395000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947473735.7\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240222061937-20240222091937-00299.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.952342093,"token_count":583,"url":"https:\/\/www.thememorialdental.com\/5-common-dental-headaches-causes\/"},"score":4,"id":"485"}
{"text":"A sad note to start. It\u2019s nearly two years since the death of Chris Cornell and with the release of his entire catalogue of Soundgarden, Audioslave and his solo tracks I found that this back-catalogue has been a helpful aide. It allows us to hear the variety of vocal skills he had, with lyrics that paint pictures and I had the pleasure to listen to 17 tunes from the deluxe record that has been released.\nFinds of 2018\nJune is the month to attend the Camden Rocks festival, an all-day session of pure rock n roll bands in a variety of venues throughout north west London. The first band of the day was the impressive SickJoy, and our very own Rachel Hasnip put some words together to celebrate their EP, Amateurs. Catching these cats at 12 pm was not only a great start, but made it difficult to focus on anyone after.\nAnother find was during another all-day music festival, this time in Hackney and performing at three different venues. I came across a trio called Gender Roles upstairs at the Paper Dress vintage shop. These guys smashed it with their lead vocalist\u2019s Nirvana growl and heavy garage riffs. A pure pleasure to hear and they will be introduced soon in our Band of The Day feature.\nThroughout 2018 we followed the Metal 2 The Masses competition at the Big Red in North London. During my time there two bands grabbed my attention. Firstly, Imperium who have appeared as a Band of the Day. That evening they were last on stage and gave it full on thrash. I needed to take my earplugs out just to feel their music unfiltered.\nOn the same competition, but on a different evening, appeared another BOTD who I was grateful to hear, see and enjoy. Because of that, I\u2019ve been following their journey to see where Empire Warning will go.\nGigs of 2018\nWell, I\u2019m going for the Pearl Jam rescheduled gig as it was three hours of unapologetic rock music. I\u2019ve seen these guys many times over the years but this evening at the sold out O2 arena in London was a pure party atmosphere, sending me through every emotional escapade that any get together could only wish to achieve. Music from back in the day to cover tunes to acknowledging their sadness they couldn\u2019t perform earlier in the year due to Eddie losing his voice. Seeing these five rock stars on stage showing us that they still enjoy performing live, and Mike McCready the guitarist who makes love to that damn instrument\u2026 it\u2019s pure musical porn.\nYou know what, I sat behind him at a gig in Seattle and I never said a word to him. I regret not thanking him for his musical storytelling and the Mad Season album. Eddie and crew gave us \u201cSatan\u2019s Bed\u201d, which I haven\u2019t really heard them perform live before and which sent shivers down my spine. \u201cElderly woman\u201d, \u201cAlive\u201d, and three encores later with the lights up we hear the final track of the night \u201cAll Along the Watchtower\u201d. This brought the night to a wonderful, powerful ending bringing back memories of my teenage years \u2013 from my days of having hair to the days of growing my beard, to the days of being follicle-challenged, Pearl Jam are there with me.\nSticking with old-school charms \u2013 Powerflo played the Boston Music Rooms. This group of hell-raisers joined forces to basically, well, raise some hell for fans around the world. This evening in London Powerflo, which features Sen Dog, Christian Olde Wolbers, Roy Lozano and Bill Graziadei, appeared on stage. The guys smash those riffs like it\u2019s a retirement show, full-on blistering vocals, hardcore riffs, drumming that would clear tinnitus\u2026 It\u2019s a pleasure seeing these legends show us their humility and how they stayed back after the gig to meet everyone.\nAlbums of 2018\nPieces of Me by Tiffany. This may be a surprise. I loved having the chance to listen to and put some words together for my first ever musical crush, Tiffany. Her voice is still as powerful and catchy as she was back in the day, and I\u2019m still enjoying these soft rock touches.\nValley of Thorns by The Kut. The London based trio have been hitting the stage constantly throughout the UK, introducing us to their debut record which was brought together by fans on PledgeMusic. Then signing a huge deal with Cargo Music and getting huge airplay, all because of the efforts of guitarist, vocalist and founder Princess Maha. Drummer extraordinaire Diana Bartmann and bassist Stella Vie have bled for this alongside her. They deserve everything they get, and all I can say is look for what 2019 brings for these maniacs.\nNational Insecurity by Thunder on the Left. Put out at the beginning of the year, the lyrics and strength in songs is a force of nature and seeing them live in 2017 made my glands excited. It does seem as this year has flown by, this trio has now become a duo, a bit opposite to a Spice Girls song. Some incredible stuff is to be heard in 2019 from TOTL.\nTattooist find of the year\nI attended the Tattoo Collective at the beginning of the year in East London\u2019s Brick Lane. I spotted a bloke having his shin inked. He was laughing, talking and basically chilling, relaxed and not even drunk. The tattoo artist didn\u2019t have an ink gun, in fact, no electricity at all. She was holding what looked like a chopstick. Researching further by standing at her booth, I noticed she is an artist in residence at Brighton\u2019s Blue Dragon. Sarah Lu is a hand poke artist, just a needle and a chopstick, no electricity. Her artwork intrigued me, so I\u2019ve been following her work ever since and still waiting for a space in her calendar to tattoo me.\nWhat am I looking forward to in 2019?\nSomething new and a Sarah Lu tattoo.","metadata":{"date":1709553468000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947476442.30\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240304101406-20240304131406-00399.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.972104609,"token_count":1286,"url":"https:\/\/www.moshville.co.uk\/feature\/2018\/12\/2018-crew-review-mark-writer\/"},"score":0,"id":"486"}

{"text":"As the field of veterinary medicine continues to evolve, so too does our understanding of pharmaceutical treatments for our furry friends. One such treatment, gabapentin, has been increasingly used for various health conditions in dogs, especially those related to pain, seizures, and anxiety. While this medication has shown positive results, the potential for long-term side effects remains a topic of concern among pet owners and veterinarians alike.\nThe Role of Gabapentin in Canine Health Management\nOriginally designed as an anticonvulsant, gabapentin has found a place in veterinary medicine due to its analgesic properties and calming effects. Its ability to ease nerve pain, manage seizure disorders, and calm anxiety in dogs has made it a go-to solution for veterinarians worldwide.\nRecognizing Side Effects\nLike all medications, gabapentin carries the potential for side effects. Typical short-term side effects include sedation, lethargy, loss of balance, and gastrointestinal issues like vomiting and diarrhea. However, when it comes to long-term use, the side effects may become more complex.\nLong-Term Side Effects of Gabapentin\nLethargy and Loss of Coordination\nExtended use of gabapentin may lead to persistent lethargy and a notable loss of coordination in some dogs. This could manifest as your dog seeming uninterested in activities they once enjoyed, or displaying difficulty walking or balancing.\nChanges in Appetite and Weight\nGabapentin can influence your pet\u2019s eating habits, leading to changes in weight over time. Monitor your pet\u2019s food intake and body weight regularly and discuss any concerns with your vet.\nLong-term use of gabapentin can sometimes lead to edema, a condition characterized by swelling in the limbs due to fluid accumulation.\nWhile rare, more severe side effects like bone marrow suppression have been reported. Such effects, though not common, underline the need for regular veterinary check-ups when your pet is on long-term medication.\nManaging the Risks\nTo reduce the risk of side effects, a controlled, tailored dosage regimen is vital. Factors such as your dog\u2019s age, weight, overall health, and the condition being treated will all influence the appropriate dosage. Regular veterinary monitoring can ensure the dosage remains optimal and mitigate any potential side effects.\nFAQs About Long-Term Use of Gabapentin in Dogs\n1. Is Gabapentin Safe for Long-Term Use in Dogs?\nOverall, gabapentin is considered safe for long-term use in dogs when administered under the supervision of a veterinarian. However, it\u2019s important to monitor for any potential side effects and address them promptly. Regular vet check-ups are crucial to assess your dog\u2019s health and adjust the dosage if necessary.\n2. How Does Gabapentin Help Older Dogs?\nGabapentin can provide substantial relief for older dogs suffering from chronic pain, especially related to arthritis and nerve-related pain. Additionally, it may aid in managing anxiety and seizures, enhancing the overall quality of life for aging dogs. However, careful dosage and frequent veterinary check-ups are necessary to monitor for any potential adverse effects.\n3. Can Gabapentin Cause Neurological Problems in Dogs?\nWhile it\u2019s rare, prolonged use of gabapentin could potentially lead to neurological issues such as loss of coordination or balance. If your dog exhibits unusual behaviors like stumbling, struggling to walk, or appearing disoriented, it\u2019s crucial to seek immediate veterinary attention.\n4. Can Gabapentin Damage a Dog\u2019s Liver?\nThere\u2019s no substantial evidence indicating that gabapentin causes liver damage in dogs. However, if your pet has pre-existing liver conditions, it\u2019s important to discuss this with your vet, as it may influence the metabolism and efficacy of the medication.\n5. What Happens If You Suddenly Stop Gabapentin in Dogs?\nStopping gabapentin abruptly, especially if your dog has been taking it for a significant period, may cause withdrawal symptoms such as restlessness, agitation, and potentially seizures. Therefore, it\u2019s recommended to consult your vet before making any changes to your dog\u2019s medication regimen.\n6. Can High Doses of Gabapentin Harm My Dog?\nHigh doses of gabapentin may lead to an overdose, with symptoms including severe lethargy, loss of coordination, and potentially depression of the respiratory system. It\u2019s vital to adhere strictly to the dosage advised by your vet, and if you suspect an overdose, seek immediate veterinary attention.\n7. Can Gabapentin Help My Dog\u2019s Arthritis?\nYes, gabapentin can help manage chronic pain associated with arthritis in dogs by reducing inflammation and nerve pain, making it a commonly prescribed medication for this condition.\n8. Are There Any Behavioral Changes in Dogs Taking Gabapentin Long-Term?\nWhile gabapentin generally calms dogs and reduces anxiety, it may cause behavioral changes such as lethargy and sedation. Some dogs may seem less responsive or enthusiastic about activities they previously enjoyed. It\u2019s essential to closely observe your pet and consult with your vet if you notice any significant behavioral shifts.\n9. How Do I Know If My Dog Is Having an Adverse Reaction to Gabapentin?\nSigns of an adverse reaction can range from mild to severe. These may include persistent vomiting or diarrhea, drastic changes in appetite or thirst, unsteady movements, or unusual behaviors like excessive sleepiness or agitation. If you observe any of these signs, it\u2019s crucial to contact your vet immediately.\n10. How Do I Safely Wean My Dog Off Gabapentin?\nIf your dog needs to stop taking gabapentin, it\u2019s crucial to do so gradually and under the guidance of a vet. Suddenly discontinuing the medication can lead to withdrawal symptoms. Your vet will provide a tailored plan to gradually reduce the dosage over time to minimize any potential withdrawal effects.\n11. What Are the Alternatives to Gabapentin for Managing Pain in Dogs?\nThere are several alternatives to gabapentin for managing pain in dogs, including NSAIDs, opioids, and other medications like tramadol or amantadine. Certain non-pharmaceutical approaches such as physiotherapy, weight management, and dietary supplements can also be beneficial. It\u2019s crucial to discuss these options with your vet to determine the best approach for your dog\u2019s specific needs.\n12. Can Gabapentin Interact with Other Medications My Dog Is Taking?\nGabapentin can interact with certain medications, potentially altering their effectiveness or causing adverse effects. If your dog is on other medications, especially antacids, morphine, or hydrocodone, it\u2019s important to inform your vet. They will carefully consider these factors when prescribing gabapentin and determining the appropriate dosage.\n13. Can Gabapentin Help with My Dog\u2019s Anxiety?\nYes, gabapentin can help manage anxiety in dogs due to its calming effects. It\u2019s often used for anxiety associated with specific triggers, like thunderstorms or vet visits. However, for chronic anxiety disorders, it\u2019s usually part of a comprehensive treatment plan that may also include behavioral therapy and other medications.\n14. What Precautions Should I Take When Giving My Dog Gabapentin?\nBefore starting your dog on gabapentin, inform your vet about any pre-existing conditions your pet may have, especially kidney disease. Also, disclose any other medications or supplements your dog is currently taking. Always follow the dosage instructions carefully and avoid abruptly stopping the medication without consulting your vet.\n15. Can Gabapentin Help Manage My Dog\u2019s Seizures?\nYes, gabapentin is sometimes used as an adjunct treatment for seizures in dogs, particularly when other anti-seizure medications aren\u2019t fully effective. However, it\u2019s not typically the first-line treatment for canine epilepsy. Always consult your vet to determine the most appropriate treatment plan for your pet\u2019s specific needs.\n16. Is Gabapentin the Same as a Sedative for Dogs?\nWhile gabapentin can have sedative effects, it\u2019s not classified as a sedative. Its primary uses are for managing chronic pain and seizures. However, due to its calming effects, it is sometimes used to manage anxiety and promote relaxation in stressful situations.\n17. Can My Dog Develop a Tolerance to Gabapentin?\nWhile there\u2019s no definitive evidence that dogs can develop a tolerance to gabapentin, some pet owners have reported needing to increase their dog\u2019s dose over time to achieve the same effects. If you notice the medication seems less effective, consult with your vet. Never adjust the dosage without professional guidance.\n18. What Should I Do If I Miss a Dose of Gabapentin?\nIf you miss a dose of gabapentin, give it as soon as you remember. However, if it\u2019s close to the time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and continue with the regular schedule. Never give a double dose to make up for a missed one. In case of any confusion or uncertainty, reach out to your vet for advice.\n19. Can Gabapentin Cause Weight Gain in Dogs?\nWhile weight gain isn\u2019t a common side effect of gabapentin, the associated lethargy and decreased activity could potentially lead to weight gain over time. Monitor your dog\u2019s weight, diet, and activity level, and discuss any significant changes with your vet.\n20. Is Gabapentin Suitable for All Breeds of Dogs?\nGabapentin is generally safe for all breeds when administered under veterinary supervision. However, individual dogs may react differently to the medication due to factors like size, age, health status, and specific breed predispositions. Always consult your vet to understand the most suitable treatment for your dog\u2019s unique needs.","metadata":{"date":1709479435000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947476396.49\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240303142747-20240303172747-00799.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9063991904,"token_count":2085,"url":"https:\/\/www.bestiepaws.com\/dog-medicine\/toxicity\/long-term-side-effects-of-gabapentin-in-dogs\/"},"score":3,"id":"488"}

{"text":"Picking up the phone to connect with a prospect can be an important touchpoint on the path to purchase. So much so that a quick phone call has been proven to drive conversion rates by up to 391 per cent. As effective a method as it may be, it\u2019s also one of the most intimidating: the very thought of a placing or receiving a \u201ccold call\u201d is enough to send some running the other direction \u2013 and fast.\nWhether you\u2019re a seasoned pro or new to the field, adding the following tips to your arsenal will help you make the most of each new opportunity and learn more about your industry every step of the way.\nYou can never be too prepared for a sales call, and thanks to social media, you can easily draw on a wealth of insights on prospective customers. According to LinkedIn, \u201c61 per cent of those who do prospect research on LinkedIn are successful at initiating offline conversations.\u201d\nStart by scrolling through your prospects\u2019 Twitter, Facebook or LinkedIn profiles to learn more about them and discover what you might have in common, such as shared hobbies, where they went to school, or what interests them outside of work. You can also check out what groups, influencers or companies they follow and if they\u2019ve engaged in any conversations on these pages. If they\u2019ve posed a question to a group or are actively participating in a comment thread, joining the discussion is a great way to get on their radar and open up an opportunity to take the conversation offline.\nBefore you pick up the phone, take to social media to learn more about the voice on the other end of the line. Not only will this humanize your interaction and make your conversation flow organically, but it can also shed light on pain points they, or other potential customers, are experiencing that you might have a solution for.\nDon\u2019t Fear Silence\nUnlike a first date or elevator ride with your boss\u2019s boss, where your first instinct is to avoid awkward silence at all costs, don\u2019t rush to fill a break in the conversation. Especially if you\u2019ve just asked a question.\nB2B sales expert Jill Konrath stresses the importance of giving your prospect time to fully process their answer, citing research that found \u201cpeople need 8-10 seconds to formulate the start of their answer.\u201d If you cut them off ahead of time you might be missing out on valuable information, like their current challenges or opportunities. Not to mention the message it sends when you keep interjecting with your own thoughts or opinions. Being an active listener will reveal far more about their business\u2019 needs, which is ultimately how you\u2019ll close the deal.\nApproach each call as you would a presentation by speaking calmly, with intention, and leaving time for your audience to process your words and draw their own conclusions. This will convey the confidence you\u2019ll need to become their trusted advisor and open up a two-way dialogue you both can benefit from.\nUse Rejection to Your Advantage\nAny sales rep knows all too well that hearing \u201cno\u201d is part of the job, but that never gets easier. Douglas Magazine, citing research firm TOPO, states \u201cit takes 18 dials to connect to a single buyer; and call-back rates are lower than one per cent.\u201d Facing these odds, it\u2019s important to make the most of every call, no matter the outcome.\nTreat each rejection as an opportunity to improve your pitch by keeping detailed notes: as soon as you\u2019ve hung up, take a moment to jot down the conversation and what might have gone wrong. Log each call in your CRM system to house all of this information in one place, and you\u2019ll quickly determine what\u2019s working and what\u2019s not. Be sure to revisit these at the end of each cycle to look for patterns and decide where to focus your efforts.\nNo matter what the outcome, every call you make is an opportunity to learn, improve and make your sales calls more successful. The key is investing the time to prepare for each prospect, really listen once you\u2019re on the call, and properly download after. The payoff is well worth it.","metadata":{"date":1709564709000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947476452.25\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240304133241-20240304163241-00499.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9530205727,"token_count":879,"url":"https:\/\/www.salesforce.com\/ca\/blog\/ace-your-next-sales-call\/?bc=WA"},"score":1,"id":"494"}
{"text":"When Volvo launched its latest platform, called Scalable Product Architecture, with the current XC90 SUV back in 2014, it made everything else in Volvo\u2019s lineup feel instantly out of date. Volvo's S60, its compact sedan, was the last in line to get the upgrade, but now its time has come.\nWith the new platform comes growth \u2014 the 2016 S60 is 4.9 inches longer and about an inch wider than the previous S60. While that doesn\u2019t sound like much, add in its 1.8-inch lower stance than the outgoing model, and the S60 has some serious curb presence. Compared to the outgoing car, the new model is nipped and tucked in all the right places. The new S60\u2019s hood height is lower, which exaggerates the rest of the car\u2019s fresh sheetmetal.\nThe new S60 also introduces the Polestar Engineered models to the lineup, following the path of companies like Mercedes-Benz with its AMG line. On the S60, the Polestar Engineered model sits at the top of the hierarchy and uses the T8 twin-engine plug-in hybrid for motive force, then gets a set of Ohlins nonadjustable dampers, extra power and gold-painted Brembo brakes. The Polestar Engineered S60 also sports a set of 19-inch wheels.\nAlong with the chassis architecture and engine choices, the new S60 also inherits Volvo\u2019s current interior and Sensus infotainment system. The S60 is the first model to roll out with an updated chipset, but all \u201919 models will get the refreshed system. Like the S90, the scaled-down Volvo has a simple and clean interior, with minimal buttons and an expansive stylized dashboard.\nThe S60 follows the same trim hierarchy as the rest of the Volvo line \u2014 Momentum trimmed cars serve as the entry point. From there, R-Design models get extra features like a Harman Kardon sound system, paddle shifters and LED fog lights. The Inscription models add even more luxurious features like leather upholstery, 10-way power front seats and chrome window trim.\nA 2.0-liter I4 fitted with a turbocharger and a supercharger power the T6 R-Design. The compound-boosted engine sends 316 hp and 295 lb-ft of torque through an eight-speed automatic transmission. From there, the power hits an all-wheel-drive system before transferring to the pavement.\nThe Polestar Engineered version sports the same 2.0-liter twin-charged engine, tuned to 328 hp, along with an electric motor. The plug-in hybrid squeezes 415 hp out of the system in total, making it one of the most potent Volvos you\u2019ll be able to snag at a dealer.\nThe numbers don\u2019t lie \u2014 the Polestar-prepped S60 feels considerably more powerful. The electric motor and the more aggressive tuning on the internal combustion engine set you back in your seat. The T6-prepped S60 is not exactly a slouch either, with an acceptable 5.3-second 0-60 time. If you can\u2019t swing the extra coin for the hybrid T8 twin-engine S60, you won\u2019t have any problems getting around traffic in that one.\nThe S60 T6\u2019s nonhybrid powertrain means there are no regenerative brakes \u2014 just good, standard binders. The Polestar Engineered S60's brakes, however, are harder to modulate. The initial pedal feel is light, with the Brembos grabbing aggressively later in the stroke. The nonhybrid S60 provides a better and more controllable pedal feel. When it comes to slamming on the brakes, both with stop you just fine.\nThe Ohlins dampers in the Polestar Engineered S60 feel softer than the standard-issue S60 dampers, surprisingly, soaking up the bumps well despite the upgraded wheel size. When pushing the Polestar Engineered S60, it feels firm enough and capable, but it won\u2019t rattle your fillings loose over bumps. The standard S60 feels more firm to me, with the suspension less forgiving of road issues.\nBoth models use the same electric power steering system, and it\u2019s probably the weakest link of the S60 driving experience. When you scroll the Volvo\u2019s drive mode selector into the more sporting mode, extra effort is added to the wheel. It feels artificially heavy and not any more connected to the road. In every other mode, the steering is light. Still, it does go where you point it with a decent amount of directness.\nThe electric power steering might feel numb, but it\u2019s an essential part of Volvo\u2019s Pilot Assist suite of driver aides. The adaptive cruise control works without a hitch \u2014 pushing the car along without having to manage the throttle or brake. It works at high speeds, too, but really pays dividends during a slow-speed crawl. The lane keep assist works well, too. You have to keep your hands on the wheel for legal reasons, but it feels like it's driving itself. The system also tacks an extra $2,500 onto the price.\nThere is a standard suite of Intellisafe city safety features like oncoming lane mitigation \u2014 which senses when your car crosses into oncoming lanes and tries to push you back \u2014 low-speed automatic braking to reduce collisions and a large animal collision avoidance system.

{"text":"The road to digitization \u2013 what\u2019s holding back commercial lines insurance?\nWhy generative AI could be a difference maker for insurance businesses\nIn conversation with Insurance Business America, he highlighted that one of the biggest disappointments he has seen is the propagation of APIs, which he believes do not serve the customer, the broker or the carrier across a full policy lifecycle.\nThe opportunities presented by generative AI\nOn the other hand, he pinpointed generative AI as the technology that has the potential to be truly disruptive for the industry. Collier noted that he \u2013 and the wider team at RPS \u2013 are spending a lot of time exploring the opportunities presented for generative AI to redefine the business. That\u2019s not to say there aren\u2019t challenges and areas of concern around generative AI, he said, particularly around the question of how to programme out inherent biases.\n\u201cBut overall, I\u2019m very bullish on generative AI over the next 18 to 24 months,\u201d he said. \u201cFor those who have the capability and aptitude to harness it, generative AI will be a game changer for their businesses. So that\u2019s probably the one overarching technology that I think will have the most impact, much more so than the API preponderance that we see nowadays.\u201d\nHow might generative AI reshape the insurance landscape?\nWhile assessing some of the key ways in which generative AI might impact the insurance market, Collier highlighted that there will still be the requirement for the \u201cfiring of synapses\u201d from human brains because, by its nature, insurance is very complicated. However, he believes that this technology will be equipped to handle most of the process. Looking back to his days as an underwriter, he said, he was able to map out maybe five or six correlations when accessing a risk.\n\u201cWith generative AI, you can look at hundreds of correlations, even 1,000s of correlations,\u201d he said. \u201c\u2026 And it\u2019s when you\u2019re going through hundreds of different permutations of correlations that you get these eye-opening moments that are not something a human would find. Generative AI has that capability for day-to-day tasks, so we\u2019re pretty excited about that.\n\u201cAs an industry, insurance is working to develop the aptitude to harness generative AI, which it doesn\u2019t currently have, in order to best utilize it. So, that\u2019s the challenge facing the sector which is why we [at RPS] have developed teams to try and figure out use cases and put them into practice.\u201d\nWhat\u2019s impeding innovation in insurance?\nCollier believes that this challenge is being further compounded by how insurance has fallen somewhat behind its financial services industry peers when it comes to embracing technology. That\u2019s not a blanket statement, however, he said, as personal lines insurance has actually reached a par with the wider industry while commercial lines insurance is flagging behind.\nPersonal lines insurance has largely followed in the tracks left by the banking sector, he said, which though once renowned as stodgy and almost prehistoric in its philosophies, has embraced the efficiencies and enhanced customer outcomes made possible by new technologies. Similarly to how a bank\u2019s customers no longer need to drive to a bank to deposit a check, personal lines customers are now able to purchase their insurance policies quickly and easily through the application of technology.\n\u201cCommercial lines just isn\u2019t there,\u201d he said. \u201cPart of that is the complexity piece and part of it is the belief that technology cannot do what we do. Technology can do what we do. I think the commercial insurance sector doesn\u2019t believe that technology can be as smart as we can \u2013 and I just don\u2019t think that\u2019s true.\u201d\nThe advance of technology is running into the human factor that people who have been working in the industry for years do not want to be relegated to the sidelines. Additionally, he said, some of the leaders investing in technology today are being very careful about those investments and potentially shying away from the long-term benefits of technology as weighed against the initial investment required.\nChanging mindsets \u2013 the key to embracing digitization\nA mindset shift is needed to open up the commercial insurance market to the potential of fully embracing digitization and Collier shared his thoughts on what might be holding it back. One of the challenges is knowledge, he said, and how to share and transfer knowledge in the interests of creating a more engaged marketplace.\n\u201cSo how do we overcome the impediment?\u201d he asked. \u201cA lot of it is through education, and getting out there to show and tell what technology is capable of. A small pilot or proof of concept goes a long way in showing the success.\n\u201cGetting this right comes down to education and knowledge transfer. And I think the industry really needs to start looking at hiring people from outside, who have other philosophies, beliefs, and ideas on how to overcome these challenges.\u201d\nLooking at how RPS is navigating this landscape, Collier noted that the firm faces the same challenges as the rest of the market. However, within RPS, he said, there\u2019s a core group of people who are always pushing for change and laying the groundwork to create a strong foundation for future growth, aided by technology.\n\u201cIt\u2019s up to us to really be the stewards of change by driving that education and knowledge transfer,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we recognize the need to put more investment in the ideas and creativity behind some of the solutions that are at our fingertips.\u201d\nKeep up with the latest news and events\nJoin our mailing list, it\u2019s free!","metadata":{"date":1709116481000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947474700.89\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240228080245-20240228110245-00699.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9652146101,"token_count":1206,"url":"https:\/\/propertynews4u.com\/commercial\/the-road-to-digitization-whats-holding-back-commercial-lines-insurance\/"},"score":0,"id":"498"}

Here, Smyth has worked with several other game creators on an IF short built entirely with Unity. I've played other strong IF implemented with Unity alongside other programs (most often Twine), but here, Unity stands alone. I don't think that \"Love, Prestige & Spookiness\" is the best IF I've seen built with Unity (I've recently discovered Niklas Glosen's Unity\/Twine IF, which is stronger in this regard), but it does demonstrate what an IF game built WHOLLY through Unity can look like and how such an approach may be able to change the shape of IF in new ways. This game takes a kind of point and click approach to an open ended IF story where the player can visit varied rooms (faintly evocative of a parser) and then make choices via hyperlink (evocative of Twine). The overall flavor of this game is new. However, the story is very short. While it plays out some interesting ideas, it doesn't push them very far and feels lacking as a whole, as a result. Overall, I think that this game is noteworthy as an experimental piece, but as a playable game, it falters a little bit.\n(Be sure to play the game on a computer with a mouse or keypad which allows you to use a scrolling function.)\nNontraditional Parser, Gamebook, IF and Systems by thecanvasrose\nThis list is based on a poll you can add votes to.

{"text":"Every new year comes complete with a new set of goals, both personal and professional. While it can be difficult to maintain the motivation or achieve the goals you set out to tackle, there are certain things you can do to make the goal-setting process more successful. A large part of the process is actually in the planning phase. As you map out your career goals for 2022, consider doing these three things a little differently to really make a difference in your professional life next year.\nSet Goals that Motivate and Inspire You\nWhen it comes to evaluating your career path, it\u2019s important to be honest about where you are and where you want to be. Setting smaller, achievable goals is a good tactic to get you through your workday or month, but you also need something big to aim for so that you are inspired in the long term. Set challenging goals that make you want to get out of bed in the morning, do your best work, and celebrate when you achieve your smaller goals. Focus on achievements that are important to you and that you will value in the long run, rather than just reasonable achievements that help you get your work done. Don\u2019t focus on goals that are completely unreasonable or which have no clear path to achievement. But don\u2019t sell yourself short by setting a goal that you have no vested interest in the outcome either. Make it a priority and go to work every day with that goal at the top of your mind.\nSMART goals are goals that are Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, and Time-Bound. This is particularly true for challenging goals, because this method helps you make sure you are committed and held accountable to your goals. Be specific about what you want to achieve with a particular goal. Make sure that you are able to measure your successes or failures in what you do throughout the year. Keep in mind that attainability is critical, especially for challenging goals, because if you give up on a big goal because it\u2019s unrealistic, then you are less likely to be motivated toward other challenging goals. Make sure that your goal is relevant to your life and your work. And give yourself and your goal a schedule and stick to it.\nMake a Plan and Write It Down\nWriting down your goals helps to solidify them in your mind and in your life. It gives them a certain tangible and real place in your life. If you have a spot in your home or workspace where you turn to for inspiration, then that is a great place to keep a hard copy of your goals. This helps keep your challenging aspirations at the front of your mind.\nGoals are little more than daydreams if you don\u2019t have a plan to achieve them.

The laboratory was unveiled by Robert Kemp, Deputy Minister Counselor, Economic, Environment, Science, and Technology at the United States Embassy, who dedicated HITC's new lab in the region. The day also commemorates the fifth anniversary of the HITC, one of the company's main technology development hubs outside of the United States. The new laboratory will support local and regional OEM partners in designing, incubating and testing new refrigerants, while helping them transition to low-global-warming-potential (LGWP) alternatives. The new Honeywell laboratory is fully equipped with modern equipment to evaluate air conditioning and refrigeration technologies. Amongst other capabilities, the laboratory can simulate in environmental chambers a full spectrum of global temperatures, from the hottest places on earth to the coldest.\nAs one of the key signatories to the Kigali amendment to the Montreal Protocol, India has committed to cutting down hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) use. By reducing the use of chemicals with high global-warming-potential (GWP), the historic amendment aims to limit the global temperature increase to no more than 0.5\u00ac\u221eC by the end of the century.\n\u201cHoneywell is committed to providing next-generation solutions that are available today as an option to support the Indian government on transitioning from HFCs to environmentally preferable materials,\u201d said Julien Soulet, Managing Director for Honeywell Fluorine Products in Europe, Middle East, Africa and India. \u201cWith the launch of this laboratory at HITC, we look forward to working hand-in-hand with our Indian partners to design near drop-in refrigeration solutions that help them meet their environmental commitments.\u201d\nHoneywell is a world leader in the development, manufacture and supply of refrigerants that are sold worldwide under the Solstice \u00ae and Genetron \u00ae brand names for a range of applications, including refrigeration, building and automobile air conditioning.

This qualitative study focuses on six members of one active, engaged, service-based community which has supported schools Northeast Ohio for over a century. The research revealed that a successful Sister-to-laity leadership transition will have its foundation in charismatic love, encourage faith-filled mentoring of faculty and students, honor the mission of the founding community, and support an overarching leadership culture of magnanimity to all stakeholders. This model can be employed in other educational and nonprofit settings where non-hierarchical servant leadership would be an effective approach.\nWest, Sarah M., \"\"Serviam\": a Historical Case Study of Leadership in Transition in Urban Catholic Schools in Northeast Ohio\" (2017).

{"text":"Footy vs. Footie: Know the Difference\nBy Shumaila Saeed || Updated on December 25, 2023\nFooty and Footie typically refer to the same thing, a colloquial term for football, especially in Australian and British English, but their spelling differs regionally.\nThe spelling variation, Footy, is more aligned with Australian and New Zealand vernacular, symbolizing their unique adaptation of the sport. Conversely, Footie, with its 'ie' ending, is more in tune with British informal speech patterns and is synonymous with their version of football.\nIn terms of cultural significance, Footy in Australia encompasses a deep connection with Australian Rules Football, a sport with unique rules and a fervent fan base. Footie in the UK similarly evokes a strong cultural and emotional connection to football, the most popular sport in the region.\nWhile both Footy and Footie are informal and casual terms, their usage in media and conversation immediately signifies the region-specific version of football being discussed, highlighting the regional diversity of the English language.\nAlthough the terms are used interchangeably in some contexts, Footy and Footie serve as linguistic markers, distinguishing Australian English from British English, and reflecting the global variations and adaptations of the game of football.\nPredominantly Australian and New Zealand\nOften Australian Rules Football\nGenerally Association Football (Soccer)\nDeeply tied to Australian sport culture\nStrongly connected to British football culture\nUsed casually in speech and media\nSimilarly used in an informal context\nSounds like \"foot-ee\"\nSimilar, but with a slightly softer 'ie' sound\nFooty and Footie Definitions\nA term used to describe football merchandise.\nI bought a new footy jersey.\nCasual term for football-related activities.\nJoin us for a game of footie in the park.\nAustralian Rules Football.\nHe's playing footy this weekend.\nA term signifying a football match in a friendly context.\nWe won the footie match yesterday!\nA playful term for football used in casual conversation.\nAre you up for a game of footy?\nUsed to describe football equipment or apparel.\nI need new boots for footie.\nInformal term for football in general.\nI love watching footy with my friends.\nBritish informal term for association football (soccer).\nThey're passionate about playing footie.\nFootball (association football) (soccer in US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand)\nSlang for football culture or fandom in the UK.\nHe's really into the footie scene.\nThe game or sport of football, usually Australian rules football or rugby league, but not soccer\nAlternative spelling of footy\nThe ball used in a game of footy.\n(especially in plural) a blanket sleeper or similar covering that covers the foot.\nA short sock.\nHaving foots or settlings.\nFooty oil or molasses\nOf bad quality;

{"text":"This year marks the 30th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). Signed into law on July 26, 1990, this landmark legislation increased access and opportunity for people with disabilities. Thanks to the ADA which provides equal access to public transportation, transportation is more accessible and affords more inclusion for individuals with disabilities. However, even with the tremendous progress of the last thirty years, transportation remains a top barrier to inclusion for people with disabilities and older adults.\nAccording to the NADTC Transportation Needs and Assessment report, 8 in 10 non-drivers with a disability cannot do the activities or chores they need or like to because of transportation barriers. Transportation is the connection to every aspect of inclusion: access to health care, employment, social activities and connecting with friends, family and faith communities. On demand, accessible transportation is truly the means to freedom and independence.\nAcross the nation, federal, state and local entities are continuing the progress of the ADA in access and inclusion by improving the accessibility of transportation through enhancing coordination. In Tennessee, a coalition of disability, aging and transportation experts teamed up with legislative leaders to address better coordination with the goal of expanding and improving accessible transportation by introducing the Tennessee Accessible Transportation and Mobility Act of 2020. The effort was led by the Tennessee Council on Developmental Disabilities, which engaged people who use or need accessible transportation throughout Tennessee as key advisors. The bill passed unanimously March 2020.\nTwo members of the Council on Developmental Disabilities with diverse life experiences and disabilities testified before the Senate Transportation and Safety Committee transportation to the common barriers they face in their communities and the need for expanded and improved accessible transportation.\n- Clancey Hopper of Lebanon, TN, lives in a relatively rural area. Clancey has a developmental disability that affects her spatial awareness and does not drive, but has a full time job at United Health Care and lives in her own apartment that is not walkable to the places she frequents like the store, church, her parents\u2019 home or her job.\n- Martez Williams of Nashville, TN, lives in an urban center. Martez has a physical disability. He drives independently but relies on accessible parking, sidewalks, and other structures \u2013 for example, gas stations\u2013 to access his community.\nPowerfully, Representative Darren Jernigan who is paraplegic testified as well, sharing with his fellow legislators the difficulties of navigating transportation every day.\nWhat does the new law do?\nThe Tennessee Accessible Transportation and Mobility Act of 2020 creates a new office within the Tennessee Department of Transportation (TDOT) that will focus solely on accessible transportation and offer a new and sustained level of support to localities across the state. The new law requires that by March 31, 2021, the office will produce and share with the Tennessee General Assembly:\n- A mission statement,\n- A five-year plan, and\n- The state\u2019s first annual report about accessible transportation in Tennessee.\nCritically, the law requires these activities to be informed by an advisory committee of stakeholders that includes both transportation, aging and disability experts and people who use accessible transportation. The new statewide office will work with a diverse advisory group to identify the state\u2019s needs and solutions that can change over time. The law also advises government agencies to coordinate with TDOT toward the goal of expanding and improving accessible transportation and mobility across Tennessee, including state agencies that fund Medicaid (Tennessee Department of Health), Vocational Rehabilitation (Tennessee Department of Education) and American Job Centers (Tennessee Department of Labor and Workforce Development).\nNow that the Office of Accessible Transportation has been established by law, TDOT has appointed a lead, Emily Duchac to the new office. Already, the office has offered competitive funding for Mobility Management programs operated by public transportation providers. This will allow TDOT to leverage the existing Tennessee Association of Human Resources Agency model to coordinate mobility through regional mobility managers. This statewide mobility management program has the goal of enhancing mobility and facilitating access to transportation in Tennessee, especially those with specialized transportation needs.\nGoing forward, the new office will work with a group of stakeholders to complete the mission statement, five-year plan, and first annual report.\nVideo of testimony: http:\/\/tnga.granicus.com\/MediaPlayer.php?view_id=414&clip_id=21440\nThanks to our guest blogger, Lauren Pearcy, Public Policy Director with the Tennessee Council on Developmental Disabilities.\nHeather Edmonds, National Aging and Disability Transportation Center (NADTC), contributed to this blog.","metadata":{"date":1708595822000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947473738.92\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240222093910-20240222123910-00399.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9428237677,"token_count":929,"url":"https:\/\/www.nadtc.org\/news\/blog\/tennessee-addresses-accessible-transportation-barriers-with-new-law\/"},"score":3,"id":"509"}

{"text":"In Computational intelligence and neuroscience\nDiabetes is a chronic disease that can cause several forms of chronic damage to the human body, including heart problems, kidney failure, depression, eye damage, and nerve damage. There are several risk factors involved in causing this disease, with some of the most common being obesity, age, insulin resistance, and hypertension. Therefore, early detection of these risk factors is vital in helping patients reverse diabetes from the early stage to live healthy lives. Machine learning (ML) is a useful tool that can easily detect diabetes from several risk factors and, based on the findings, provide a decision-based model that can help in diagnosing the disease. This study aims to detect the risk factors of diabetes using ML methods and to provide a decision support system for medical practitioners that can help them in diagnosing diabetes. Moreover, besides various other preprocessing steps, this study has used the synthetic minority over-sampling technique integrated with the edited nearest neighbor (SMOTE-ENN) method for balancing the BRFSS dataset. The SMOTE-ENN is a more powerful method than the individual SMOTE method. Several ML methods were applied to the processed BRFSS dataset and built prediction models for detecting the risk factors that can help in diagnosing diabetes patients in the early stage. The prediction models were evaluated using various measures that show the high performance of the models. The experimental results show the reliability of the proposed models, demonstrating that k-nearest neighbor (KNN) outperformed other methods with an accuracy of 98.38%, sensitivity, specificity, and ROC\/AUC score of 98%. Moreover, compared with the existing state-of-the-art methods, the results confirm the efficacy of the proposed models in terms of accuracy and other evaluation measures. The use of SMOTE-ENN is more beneficial for balancing the dataset to build more accurate prediction models. This was the main reason it was possible to achieve models more accurate than the existing ones.\nUllah Zahid, Saleem Farrukh, Jamjoom Mona, Fakieh Bahjat, Kateb Faris, Ali Abdullah Marish, Shah Babar","metadata":{"date":1708997298000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947474669.36\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240226225941-20240227015941-00698.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9423106909,"token_count":435,"url":"http:\/\/doctorpenguin.com\/2022-10-11_13_summary\/"},"document_id":1,"scores":[3]}

{"text":"Are you getting tired of looking for the signs yet? Are you growing weary of searching through YouTube channels, Facebook, Twitter, and all the other venues of the internet to see the next sure sign that the Lord is coming back soon, looking for the next event that will “cap off” all the others. “And then if any man shall say to you, Lo, here is Christ; or, lo, he is there; believe him not.” (Mark 13:21)\nThis is part of the reason for some of the signs we are seeing, so that those who do not desire to be about the business that they are supposed to be doing will be drawn away by not only false signs, but false Christs. So far the main body of material seems to be floods, fires, and sinkholes, but the advent of beings from outer space is also beginning to creep into the images and news stories that are captivating the minds of those who seem to say no more than “He is coming back soon!” Yes, He is, but what are you doing to show a lost world what they need to do before He does.\nThese items are going to be drawing more and more people away as they increase in frequency, for they will look to and for the signs as proof of the coming event, and in far too many cases these same individuals will be doing little more than that, just looking. Once the fires die down and the waters flow less through the streets of the cities, these same individuals will begin to look elsewhere, as stated, the coming alien invasion seems to be permeating quite a bit of these “news” broadcasts, volcanoes and earthquakes of course will fit into the ”prophetic” warnings, but if you will recall, our Lord said that he would return for us, “For in such an hour as ye think not the Son of man cometh.” (Matt. 24:44)\nWhat will be next then, someone doing “miracles” that some believe could only be attributed to God? Many will fall prey to that great deceit, the Roman Catholic Church has been a great “purveyor,” if you will, of so-called visible miracles for quite some time, it is a good way to keep the masses in check, to keep the “obedience through the possibility of persecution” continuing, so it would not surprise me if we begin to see a few false signs coming from that direction. Some will say the so-called pandemic is a sure sign, but these have done very little research into the factual evidence, others will point to the coming global economic crisis, the great worldwide famines that are inevitable, the cashless society, or perhaps the advent of artificial intelligence that soon Christ will take His church out, (1 Thess. 4:17)\nHere is the point my friends, what difference should it make to any of us, to any born-again believer when the Lord comes back, how exactly is that going to change in one bit what you should be doing and what you were supposed to be accomplishing for Him since the first day that you were saved from your sins? Haven’t you been warning the lost all this time anyway, haven’t you been telling them of His love, grace, and mercy since the day you got off your knees at the cross? Did you really need all these signs to “kick start” your faith, your obedience to what you are supposed to be doing even without them?\nHere is the next trap of our adversary that so many have already fallen into, spending far too much time looking at the signs, searching for the next one, and not bringing into the conversation the need for repentance to a lost world, and not just so these people that will listen will miss the tribulation period, but so they will avert an eternity of pain and great suffering, so that they also can come to the knowledge of the grace of God that is available through Jesus Christ.\nWill some perhaps listen a little more intently when you expound to them the truths of the Scriptures in relation to these days, perhaps, but how many will make a true confession of faith and how many will only be trapped by the same emotional construct that is affecting so many others these days, only to fall away when a specific period of peaceful times ensue. Are we in the last days? We have been since our Lord went back to the Father. Are we in the last of the last days, or how about nearing the end of the last of the very last days, how many adjectives would you like to add here. Recall what the two angels said to those who were standing around looking up at the sky for who knows how long after that moment. “Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven? this same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven.” (Acts 1:11)\nAre you doing the same, is all you do any more in relation to the words in this letter to you is to search high and low for the next sign of His imminent return, wondering to yourself “This is it!” To put it bluntly my brothers and sisters, get back to work, keep your eyes on the prize that is Christ, reprove, rebuke, lift up your brothers and sisters in Christ, love you neighbor, take a glance occasionally at what is happening around the planet, but don’t sit there staring at the sky all day, you have a job you are supposed to be doing. “Wherefore comfort one another with these words.” (1 Thess. 4:18) And then get back to work.","metadata":{"date":1708886115000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947474641.34\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240225171204-20240225201204-00798.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.972667098,"token_count":1196,"url":"https:\/\/www.borrowedtruths.com\/get-back-to-work\/"},"document_id":5,"scores":[0]}
{"text":"If you tune in and listen to the ‘Drive Show’ that airs on Radio Maisha every Monday to Friday from 4-7pm, then you are familiar with the voice of one Zulekha.\nZulekha is the show’s comedian. If you’ve ever wondered if a pretty girl can be funny, then you’ve not met Zulekha. I must say she is talented. Together with her co-host Tina Koroso, they have managed to keep thousands of listeners glued to their show every drive time.\nWhen she is behind the mic, from time to time, she changes her tone of voice. From a deep Somali accented old woman to a young Meru lad, Zulekha has captured the attention of her listeners who are always left in stitches due to her jokes. But what is she like up close and candid?\nZulekha Akinyi Otieno is a striking woman, the kind that owns a room the minute she walks in. But there is also another side to her. She is down-to-earth. What many people may not know is that she is half Somali half Luo.\nBorn and brought up in Zimmerman in Nairobi, Zulekha had to endure a difficult childhood and the painful memories are still evident. “I come from a single parent family. My mother shouldered the responsibility of raising us. I have two brothers and I am the middle child,” says Zulekha.\n“The painful part is that my father was a drunkard. He cared less if we had eaten, had clothes to wear and even books to use while in school. His life was centered on the ‘bottle’ and many are the times he left us to go on his numerous drinking sprees,” she says.\nNot having the zeal and strength to take it anymore, Zulekha says her mother decided that they shift and move to another place to start life on their own away from their father.\n“We had to flee. He didn’t even know that we had shifted to another place. At that time, I was in class two at Roysambu Primary School. My mum was open with us and gave us two options. If anyone wished to stay behind with dad then they could and if we wanted to go with her, she was not going to stop us. My brothers and I decided to go stay with mum, through thick and thin,” she bitterly recalls.\nHer dad would later die of throat cancer in 2004. “Despite his bad lifestyle, he still made time to visit us when we shifted. I have never felt bitter towards my dad. Growing up, I told myself that there is no one who does not make mistakes in life.\nHe was still our dad and we still loved him,” she says. They started their new life in Zimmerman but problems seemed to trail their way. Her mum couldn’t raise the Sh2,500 needed for rent. To make ends meet, she started a small business of making and selling chips and bhajia.\nWhen she came back from school, Zulekha would assist in selling the foodstuffs. As fate would have it, in 2009, Zulekha fell pregnant. “I realised I was pregnant at three months. I was devastated. I didn’t know how I was going to break the news to my mum.\nThoughts of having an abortion rang in my head but on a second thought, I decided I was going to keep my baby,” she says. Since it was hard for her to disclose the news to her mum, she decided to keep it to herself\n.“My mum began to notice changes in me when I was about eight months pregnant. She requested one of my aunts to come and talk to me. I had to tell her the truth. I could not hide it anymore. My mum was so devastated by the news.\nThis opened new challenges to our already stressing lives. She didn’t even want to eat food I had cooked and most of the time she was crying that I also felt bad,” she says. In November 2009, Zulekha gave birth to her son, Abdul Malik Otieno. This opened a new chapter in her life. She had to look for a job. She ventured into the entertainment industry in the same year and joined a popular programme that airs on one of the local channels.\nShe also tried her luck as a stand-up comedian in one of the local comic shows. “In 2012, I joined Kenya Kona comedy which used to air on KTN,” she says. Her breakthrough came in August 2013 when she landed a job at Radio Maisha. She recounts that moment when that call came through.\n“I was called by Radio Maisha head of radio Tom Japanni. He told me of how he had listened to me perform on the comedy shows and how I made people laugh at my jokes. He noticed my potential and requested me to visit the office which I did. Though I had never thought of joining radio, I decided to go for it,” she says.\nZulekha officially went on air in September 2013 and as she puts it, it has been an amazing experience. “My main role in the show is to bring out the light side and not make things too serious. At drive time, everyone has had a long day from work and they just want to listen to something relaxing as they go home. They want to sit and listen to Zulekha who has to make them laugh,” she says.\nIn the show, Zulekha acts as a fourty-something year old woman who doesn’t take life too serious and has her own way of dealing with issues. “It’s a character I love. As much as that woman is crazy, she fears God. I not only disturb my co-host but also the listeners,” she adds.\nAs a comedenne, and a female comic for that matter, Zulekha says she has had her fair share of challenges in the industry, from being undermined on first instances to cases of her original jokes being performed by another well-established comedian.\n“All I can say is it has taken God’s grace for me to break the ceiling in the world of comedy. Sometimes I walk out of studio after the show and can’t believe I am the one who did that. My mum cries tears of joy when she listens to me. She is proud of my achievements,” says Zulekha.\nAs the sole breadwinner in her family, she says: “I have to work hard to remain vibrant, fresh and remain abreast with the daily happenings to ensure my jokes are educative and entertaining and make people laugh,” she says.\n“It’s not easy to be spontaneous every day. In the comedy industry, it is wrong to repeat what another comedian has said. It is a crime. But I strive to do my best. I use the opportunity I have been given not only to make people laugh, but also make them learn and change their lives.”\nZulekha, however, regrets that many youth are wasting away in their homes yet they have talents that can earn them money. “Whatever you can do, do it today and give it your best because you are not guaranteed of tomorrow.\nKeep fighting because nothing comes easy. I used to write a lot of jokes and keep them in the house not knowing what God planned for me. It is all about persistence,” says Zulekha.","metadata":{"date":1708824882000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947474573.20\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240225003942-20240225033942-00299.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9898227453,"token_count":1610,"url":"https:\/\/www.standardmedia.co.ke\/evewoman\/living\/article\/2000148202\/comedian-zulekha-otienomaking-people-laugh-is-no-joke"},"document_id":6,"scores":[1]}

The cognitive revolution (although considered by some as an overly stated fact) is suggested to have been a response to the behaviorist movement that rejected introspection (anti-mentalism), and controversially lead to, what some consider, a dissolvement of the behaviorist movement. Consider the following questions about cognitivism and discuss each, basing your posture on this week’s readings, your past experiences, and your past knowledge.\n- Why is it suggested that cognitivists disagree with the behaviorist view that learning only occurs if there is an outward manifestation?

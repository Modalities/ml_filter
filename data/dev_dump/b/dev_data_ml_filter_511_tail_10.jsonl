{"text":"Every new year comes complete with a new set of goals, both personal and professional. While it can be difficult to maintain the motivation or achieve the goals you set out to tackle, there are certain things you can do to make the goal-setting process more successful. A large part of the process is actually in the planning phase. As you map out your career goals for 2022, consider doing these three things a little differently to really make a difference in your professional life next year.\nSet Goals that Motivate and Inspire You\nWhen it comes to evaluating your career path, it’s important to be honest about where you are and where you want to be. Setting smaller, achievable goals is a good tactic to get you through your workday or month, but you also need something big to aim for so that you are inspired in the long term. Set challenging goals that make you want to get out of bed in the morning, do your best work, and celebrate when you achieve your smaller goals. Focus on achievements that are important to you and that you will value in the long run, rather than just reasonable achievements that help you get your work done. Don’t focus on goals that are completely unreasonable or which have no clear path to achievement. But don’t sell yourself short by setting a goal that you have no vested interest in the outcome either. Make it a priority and go to work every day with that goal at the top of your mind.\nSMART goals are goals that are Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, and Time-Bound. This is particularly true for challenging goals, because this method helps you make sure you are committed and held accountable to your goals. Be specific about what you want to achieve with a particular goal. Make sure that you are able to measure your successes or failures in what you do throughout the year. Keep in mind that attainability is critical, especially for challenging goals, because if you give up on a big goal because it’s unrealistic, then you are less likely to be motivated toward other challenging goals. Make sure that your goal is relevant to your life and your work. And give yourself and your goal a schedule and stick to it.\nMake a Plan and Write It Down\nWriting down your goals helps to solidify them in your mind and in your life. It gives them a certain tangible and real place in your life. If you have a spot in your home or workspace where you turn to for inspiration, then that is a great place to keep a hard copy of your goals. This helps keep your challenging aspirations at the front of your mind.\nGoals are little more than daydreams if you don’t have a plan to achieve them. Goal setting is a dynamic and constantly changing activity. You need to be able to think through the steps you need to take to achieve your goals and constantly evaluate your progress. Set up regular reminders and check-ins for yourself to make sure you are on the right track.\nSuccess doesn’t just come to those who sit back and relax. Success is built on the stepping stones of effective goal planning and actions taken to achieve those goals.\nFor more tips on how to grow your career, connect with the recruiters at Bergman Brothers today and we’ll set you on the right path.","metadata":{"date":1709539677000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947476432.11\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240304065639-20240304095639-00197.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9662083983,"token_count":681,"url":"https:\/\/www.bergmanbrothers.com\/2021\/12\/27\/how-to-set-achievable-professional-goals-for-2022\/"},"document_id":502,"scores":[2]}

{"text":"Honeywell Inaugurates State-Of-The-Art Refrigerant Laboratory at the India Technology Center\nFebruary 14, 2017\nNew lab will support local OEMs in transitioning to next-generation refrigerants NEW DELHI, February 14, 2017 - Honeywell (NYSE: HON) today announced the inauguration of a state-of-the-art refrigerant laboratory at the Honeywell India Technology Center (HITC) in Gurgaon, Haryana. The laboratory was unveiled by Robert Kemp, Deputy Minister Counselor, Economic, Environment, Science, and Technology at the United States Embassy, who dedicated HITC's new lab in the region. The day also commemorates the fifth anniversary of the HITC, one of the company's main technology development hubs outside of the United States. The new laboratory will support local and regional OEM partners in designing, incubating and testing new refrigerants, while helping them transition to low-global-warming-potential (LGWP) alternatives. The new Honeywell laboratory is fully equipped with modern equipment to evaluate air conditioning and refrigeration technologies. Amongst other capabilities, the laboratory can simulate in environmental chambers a full spectrum of global temperatures, from the hottest places on earth to the coldest.\nAs one of the key signatories to the Kigali amendment to the Montreal Protocol, India has committed to cutting down hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) use. By reducing the use of chemicals with high global-warming-potential (GWP), the historic amendment aims to limit the global temperature increase to no more than 0.5¬∞C by the end of the century.\n“Honeywell is committed to providing next-generation solutions that are available today as an option to support the Indian government on transitioning from HFCs to environmentally preferable materials,” said Julien Soulet, Managing Director for Honeywell Fluorine Products in Europe, Middle East, Africa and India. “With the launch of this laboratory at HITC, we look forward to working hand-in-hand with our Indian partners to design near drop-in refrigeration solutions that help them meet their environmental commitments.”\nHoneywell is a world leader in the development, manufacture and supply of refrigerants that are sold worldwide under the Solstice ® and Genetron ® brand names for a range of applications, including refrigeration, building and automobile air conditioning. Honeywell works closely with OEMs to support the transition to next generation products.\n“Honeywell's new state-of-the-art refrigerant lab is designed to support our local customers and partners in India as they work to transition to next-generation materials,” said Rajiv Banavali, Vice President and Chief Technology Officer, Honeywell, Advanced Materials. “First mover customers in the region will benefit from the development of an industry based on environmentally preferable LGWP refrigerants that is aligned with the Government of India's vision of Make in India. ”\nHoneywell and its suppliers are in the middle of a $900 million investment program in technology development and new capacity based on Honeywell's hydrofluoro-olefin (HFO) technology, which helps customers lower their carbon footprint without sacrificing end-product performance. Honeywell has a diversified global supply network that includes commercial partnerships with manufacturers in India, China and Japan.\nWorldwide adoption of Solstice products has resulted in the reduction of more than 39 million metric tons of greenhouse gases to date, equal to permanently eliminating emissions from more than 7.5 million cars.\nHoneywell (www.honeywell.com\/us\/en) is a Fortune 100 diversified technology and manufacturing leader, serving customers worldwide with aerospace products and services; control technologies for buildings, homes and industry; turbochargers; and performance materials. All of Honeywell's global businesses have a strong legacy in India, built over the last eight decades. Honeywell's India commitment is evident in seven state-of-the-art manufacturing and engineering operations, and five global centers of excellence for technology development and innovation. Honeywell employs close to 15,000 people across 50 locations including Bangalore, Chennai, Delhi, Gurgaon, Hyderabad, Madurai, Pune and Vadodara.

This qualitative study focuses on six members of one active, engaged, service-based community which has supported schools Northeast Ohio for over a century. The research revealed that a successful Sister-to-laity leadership transition will have its foundation in charismatic love, encourage faith-filled mentoring of faculty and students, honor the mission of the founding community, and support an overarching leadership culture of magnanimity to all stakeholders. This model can be employed in other educational and nonprofit settings where non-hierarchical servant leadership would be an effective approach.\nWest, Sarah M., \"\"Serviam\": a Historical Case Study of Leadership in Transition in Urban Catholic Schools in Northeast Ohio\" (2017).

{"text":"Footy vs. Footie: Know the Difference\nBy Shumaila Saeed || Updated on December 25, 2023\nFooty and Footie typically refer to the same thing, a colloquial term for football, especially in Australian and British English, but their spelling differs regionally.\nThe spelling variation, Footy, is more aligned with Australian and New Zealand vernacular, symbolizing their unique adaptation of the sport. Conversely, Footie, with its 'ie' ending, is more in tune with British informal speech patterns and is synonymous with their version of football.\nIn terms of cultural significance, Footy in Australia encompasses a deep connection with Australian Rules Football, a sport with unique rules and a fervent fan base. Footie in the UK similarly evokes a strong cultural and emotional connection to football, the most popular sport in the region.\nWhile both Footy and Footie are informal and casual terms, their usage in media and conversation immediately signifies the region-specific version of football being discussed, highlighting the regional diversity of the English language.\nAlthough the terms are used interchangeably in some contexts, Footy and Footie serve as linguistic markers, distinguishing Australian English from British English, and reflecting the global variations and adaptations of the game of football.\nPredominantly Australian and New Zealand\nOften Australian Rules Football\nGenerally Association Football (Soccer)\nDeeply tied to Australian sport culture\nStrongly connected to British football culture\nUsed casually in speech and media\nSimilarly used in an informal context\nSounds like \"foot-ee\"\nSimilar, but with a slightly softer 'ie' sound\nFooty and Footie Definitions\nA term used to describe football merchandise.\nI bought a new footy jersey.\nCasual term for football-related activities.\nJoin us for a game of footie in the park.\nAustralian Rules Football.\nHe's playing footy this weekend.\nA term signifying a football match in a friendly context.\nWe won the footie match yesterday!\nA playful term for football used in casual conversation.\nAre you up for a game of footy?\nUsed to describe football equipment or apparel.\nI need new boots for footie.\nInformal term for football in general.\nI love watching footy with my friends.\nBritish informal term for association football (soccer).\nThey're passionate about playing footie.\nFootball (association football) (soccer in US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand)\nSlang for football culture or fandom in the UK.\nHe's really into the footie scene.\nThe game or sport of football, usually Australian rules football or rugby league, but not soccer\nAlternative spelling of footy\nThe ball used in a game of footy.\n(especially in plural) a blanket sleeper or similar covering that covers the foot.\nA short sock.\nHaving foots or settlings.\nFooty oil or molasses\nOf bad quality;

{"text":"This year marks the 30th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). Signed into law on July 26, 1990, this landmark legislation increased access and opportunity for people with disabilities. Thanks to the ADA which provides equal access to public transportation, transportation is more accessible and affords more inclusion for individuals with disabilities. However, even with the tremendous progress of the last thirty years, transportation remains a top barrier to inclusion for people with disabilities and older adults.\nAccording to the NADTC Transportation Needs and Assessment report, 8 in 10 non-drivers with a disability cannot do the activities or chores they need or like to because of transportation barriers. Transportation is the connection to every aspect of inclusion: access to health care, employment, social activities and connecting with friends, family and faith communities. On demand, accessible transportation is truly the means to freedom and independence.\nAcross the nation, federal, state and local entities are continuing the progress of the ADA in access and inclusion by improving the accessibility of transportation through enhancing coordination. In Tennessee, a coalition of disability, aging and transportation experts teamed up with legislative leaders to address better coordination with the goal of expanding and improving accessible transportation by introducing the Tennessee Accessible Transportation and Mobility Act of 2020. The effort was led by the Tennessee Council on Developmental Disabilities, which engaged people who use or need accessible transportation throughout Tennessee as key advisors. The bill passed unanimously March 2020.\nTwo members of the Council on Developmental Disabilities with diverse life experiences and disabilities testified before the Senate Transportation and Safety Committee transportation to the common barriers they face in their communities and the need for expanded and improved accessible transportation.\n- Clancey Hopper of Lebanon, TN, lives in a relatively rural area. Clancey has a developmental disability that affects her spatial awareness and does not drive, but has a full time job at United Health Care and lives in her own apartment that is not walkable to the places she frequents like the store, church, her parents’ home or her job.\n- Martez Williams of Nashville, TN, lives in an urban center. Martez has a physical disability. He drives independently but relies on accessible parking, sidewalks, and other structures – for example, gas stations– to access his community.\nPowerfully, Representative Darren Jernigan who is paraplegic testified as well, sharing with his fellow legislators the difficulties of navigating transportation every day.\nWhat does the new law do?\nThe Tennessee Accessible Transportation and Mobility Act of 2020 creates a new office within the Tennessee Department of Transportation (TDOT) that will focus solely on accessible transportation and offer a new and sustained level of support to localities across the state. The new law requires that by March 31, 2021, the office will produce and share with the Tennessee General Assembly:\n- A mission statement,\n- A five-year plan, and\n- The state’s first annual report about accessible transportation in Tennessee.\nCritically, the law requires these activities to be informed by an advisory committee of stakeholders that includes both transportation, aging and disability experts and people who use accessible transportation. The new statewide office will work with a diverse advisory group to identify the state’s needs and solutions that can change over time. The law also advises government agencies to coordinate with TDOT toward the goal of expanding and improving accessible transportation and mobility across Tennessee, including state agencies that fund Medicaid (Tennessee Department of Health), Vocational Rehabilitation (Tennessee Department of Education) and American Job Centers (Tennessee Department of Labor and Workforce Development).\nNow that the Office of Accessible Transportation has been established by law, TDOT has appointed a lead, Emily Duchac to the new office. Already, the office has offered competitive funding for Mobility Management programs operated by public transportation providers. This will allow TDOT to leverage the existing Tennessee Association of Human Resources Agency model to coordinate mobility through regional mobility managers. This statewide mobility management program has the goal of enhancing mobility and facilitating access to transportation in Tennessee, especially those with specialized transportation needs.\nGoing forward, the new office will work with a group of stakeholders to complete the mission statement, five-year plan, and first annual report.\nVideo of testimony: http:\/\/tnga.granicus.com\/MediaPlayer.php?view_id=414&clip_id=21440\nThanks to our guest blogger, Lauren Pearcy, Public Policy Director with the Tennessee Council on Developmental Disabilities.\nHeather Edmonds, National Aging and Disability Transportation Center (NADTC), contributed to this blog.","metadata":{"date":1708595822000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947473738.92\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240222093910-20240222123910-00399.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9428237677,"token_count":929,"url":"https:\/\/www.nadtc.org\/news\/blog\/tennessee-addresses-accessible-transportation-barriers-with-new-law\/"},"document_id":509,"scores":[3]}

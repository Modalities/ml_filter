{"id": "27", "text": "Facebook is “shedding more light” on the mysterious world of online advertising with its new ‘off-facebook’ feature, but the company is already warning advertisers it will impact targeting.\nThe company’s chief privacy officer policy Erin Egan and director of product management David Baser announced the launch of the new function overnight, which is set to begin being rolled out globally.\n“Many apps and websites are free because they’re supported by online advertising. And to reach people who are more likely to care about what they are selling, businesses often share data about people’s interactions on their websites with ad platforms and other services,” the Facebook executives said.\n“To help shed more light on these practices that are common yet not always well understood, today we’re introducing a new way to view and control your off-Facebook activity.”\nThe feature allows users to see and control the data that other apps and websites share with Facebook, which is gathered across the internet through the ‘Login with Facebook’ function, ‘Likes’ and embedded Facebook pixel code that hides in the background of certain websites and collects audience data.\nWith Off-Facebook, users can see a summary of all the data apps and websites have sent about them to Facebook, disconnect this information and choose to disconnect all data with the clear off-Facebook activity function.\nUsers can also tailor which apps and websites share their activity with Facebook.\nThe introduction of the new tool is on-brand with Facebook’s post-Cambridge Analytica privacy push and was actually first announced at last year’s Facebook developer conference, which took place just weeks after the scandal broke.\nIt was originally set to be a ‘Clear History’ feature (which it still is), however, Facebook opted to add in additional functions.\nBy providing more transparency to the workings of online advertising and giving users the option to opt-out of certain data collection, Facebook certainly risks hurting its profitability with the latest move.\nAhead of the announcement, Facebook issued a statement to advertisers, telling them point-blank “this feature may affect targeting”.\n“When someone disconnects their off-Facebook activity, we won’t use the data they clear for targeting. This means that targeting options powered by Facebook’s business tools, such as the Facebook pixel, can’t be used to reach someone with ads,” Facebook said.\nWhether this will scare off advertisers is yet to be seen, but with Facebook COO telling the media earlier this year “our bottom line is getting [Off-Facebook] right”, it could be argued the company is now prioritising privacy over profitability.\nOff-Facebook is initially being rolled out in Ireland, South Korea and Spain, but will expand globally in the coming months.\nDomain’s chief marketing officer (CMO), Rebecca Darley, said that without Tealium’s customer data platform (CDP), her business would not have been able to achieve the personalised marketing success that has made it one of the leaders in data-driven marketing in Australia.

{"id": "48", "text": "How Do Male Enhancement Pills Work?\nPenis size is without a doubt one of the most important things to men when it comes to their confidence. Simply put, guys that have bigger penises carry around more confidence, knowing that they can satisfy almost every woman in the bedroom. There is nothing more embarassing to a guy if he can’t get it up, keep it up, or last more than 3 minutes when in the sack.\nLike alot of guys, you may be interested in taking a male enhancement supplement to help with your problem, but your skeptical because you are unsure of whether or not it works. We decided to give you a quick overview of what male enhancement pills are TRULY designed to do, as well as give you our brief synopsis of the best performing ones on the market.\nSo How Exactly Do Penis Pills Work?\nWell, its quite simple. The penis contains a number of blood vessels and arteries that fill with blood when you are sexually aroused. See diagram below:\nPenis enlargment pills, when taken as a daily supplement, increase the amount of blood flow whenever you have an erection. Over time, as more and more blood flows to the penis, the muscle called the corpora cavernosa (CP muscle for short), gradually expands and allows more blood to flow into the penis.\nIt does this by relaxing the tissues around those muscles we talked about earlier, quickly filling the blood chambers and allowing for a sustained erection. Simply put, the more blood flowing to the penis results in fuller, longer lasting erections, a heightened sexual desire, and a more sensitive feeling during sex.\nAchieving Your Optimum Size\nIt has been said that 40 million american men suffer from some sort of erectile dysfunction. The ability to achieve a natural erection is BY FAR more effective and safe than using pharmaceutical drugs that come with harmful side effects and unneccesary prolonged erections.\nHelping yourself get rid of your ED problem will increase your confidence, sex drive, and the ability to satisfy your partner like never before. Using male enhancement pills takes time to work, but you will get the satisfaction of having an erection ON DEMAND without feeling embarrassed about your sexual competency.\nLeave Your Review of How Do Male Enhancement Pills Work?

United homegrown player, and Earl Edwards Jr. being a late loan to Loudoun. The 27-year-old goalkeeper, acquired in the offseason from Orlando City SC, started in place of Calle Brown after overcoming a groin injury to start the year.\nIn addition to Edwards, D.C. Academy product Alexxon Saravia made his first start for Loudoun, as did Shinya Kadono, who replaced the injured D.C. homegrown/loanee Antonio Bustamante in midfield. The first half saw Loudoun attempt to battle the Rowdies’ 3-5-2 press and they were generally composed. Save for an occasional turnover, and sometimes combined with play by Edwards to clear a mistake, the first half was scoreless, and Loudoun, while having a scarce opportunity to attack, had no shots in the half.\nThe second half saw evolution in Loudoun’s attack with some chances at Rowdies’ goalkeeper John McCarthy, though with no clear chance to steal any points Richie Williams appeared to strengthen his defense, with the addition of Jack-Jean Baptiste (making his USL debut) in the 65th minute. Loudoun’s shots continued to be ineffective as Orlando Sinclair (also making his USL debut) entered in the 77th and as the Rowdies hit the post. As Yow came off for Andrew Lubahn with 5 minutes left and a chance to get a point near, Loudoun continued their best to hold the back line, and a late volley by Rowdies substitute Leon Taylor in the box (one of several goal mouth opportunities the Rowdies had) went just wide of the net as Gabriele Giusti whistled full time in front of 5,893.\nAfter being off for two weeks, Loudoun finds themselves off for two more weeks, with their next game at the Ottawa Fury on April 13 at 2pm.", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

{"id": "111", "text": "ANNUAL WORKING REPORT- INDIA’S UNIQUE REQUIREMENT\nThe requirement of filing Statement of commercial working of patents in India has been an integral part of the Indian Patents regime since inception. It has been observed in the recent years, that the dominant industries of the Indian market, especially pharmaceutical and telecom, have expressed their concerns against the requirement of Form 27, that is to state the working of their patented invention in India. The ongoing debate has almost transformed into a movement supported by Indian and Global industry alike, seeking a repeal or at the least introduction of radical changes to Section 146 of the Patents Act, 1970 [Act].\nThe Annual Reports published by the Indian Patent Office [IPO] for the period of 2012 – 2017 indicate a positive change in the outlook of patent holders and a growing compliance rate in meeting the requirement of Form 27.\nThe data published by the IPO in the Annual Reports as seen in the below table shows significant increase in the number of Form 27 filings in the past five years and is reflective of positive change in the attitude of the patent holders in these years.\nAWR: AN OBLIGATORY REQUIREMENT:\nFrom the standpoint of a patentee, the importance of ‘working’ an invention / consequences of non-working became evident when the first compulsory license was issued to Natco Pharma Ltd. in 2012 for Bayer Corporation’s patented drug Nexavar. Incomplete disclosure of information on Form 27 by Bayer and the failure of the drug to be worked to an adequate extent in the Indian territory proved to be Bayer’s Achilles heel and eventually resulted in a compulsory license being granted in favour of Natco. The Patent Office while granting the compulsory license adopted the view that working of a patent in India entails local manufacture in India. The only silver lining in the entire saga emerged when the Intellectual Property Appellate Board (IPAB), after hearing the appeal against the decision of the Patent Office, disagreed with the Controller General’s findings regarding ‘importation’ and recognized that the working requirement could be met by importation. The IPAB clarified that importation is relevant for the purposes of determining whether an invention has been worked in India. Between then and now, there are a plethora of judgments which have recognized importation to be sufficient to meet the working requirement.\nThe debate regarding working statement requirement was rekindled in the year 2015, when a a writ petition was filed before the Delhi High Court, to highlight lapses in the filing of statement of workings by patentees/licensees and lack of enforcement on part of the Patent Office. The objective of the writ petition was to request the Court to enforce patent working provisions and take necessary action to compel Patentees and Licensees to comply with the law.\nThe following issues were considered by the Hon’ble High Court –\nManifest failure to comply with Section 146 of the Act as well as no action initiated under Section 122 of the Act against the Patentees who did not follow the procedure,\nWhether information provided under section 146 of the Act regarding licensees and sub-licensees is \"Confidential\" in nature.\nThe Hon’ble High Court directed the IPO to undertake consultation with stakeholders and make necessary amendments to the relevant section in the Act and Form 27 within a strict timeline, as submitted by the IPO. Even though the timeline set by the Delhi High Court has expired, no amendments with respect to AWRs have been introduced yet.\nFurther, the Hon’ble High Court held that the information regarding licensees (and sub-licensees) cannot be termed as confidential, as all information regarding the grant of patent is already available on the website of the IPO and failure to disclose such information by the Patentees would mean non-compliance with the requirements of Section 146 of the Act and thus, making such Patentees liable for action.\nThe non-compliance or failure to adhere to the working requirement can attract a high penalty under Section 122 of the Act, which includes imposing a hefty fine of approximately USD 14,500 (INR 1 million). Furthermore, if the information provided in Form 27 is found to be false, the person furnishing such statement is liable to be punished with imprisonment (which may extend upto 6 months, or with fine, or both). However, such punishment or penalty for non-compliance has not been levied on any patent holder yet.\nIn addition to the statutory provisions regarding the penalty, the Act under Section 64, confers a power on the Controller to order for revocation of a patent if he is convinced that the said invention has failed to be worked in the territory of India.\nCertain unresolved problems related to Form 27 requirement continue to be debated and are hoped to be addressed in the future.\nThe IPO has recently taken an initiative of issuing notice to the Attorneys/ Agents seeking compliance of Annual Working Report (AWR) i.e. Form 27 of their granted patents. It appears that this initiative is an indication of stronger enforcement of the statement of working requirement, in the times to come.\nThe requirement of filing Form 27 in India is unique in many ways. One of the paramount rationales behind it is to prevent the Patentees from creating blocking monopolies, i.e. obtaining and maintaining patents for the purpose of blocking others from developing technologies in the vicinity of the patented inventions.\nAs stipulated in Section 83 of the Act that patents are not granted merely to enable patentees to enjoy a monopoly on a patented article, but to secure that the inventions are worked in India on a commercial scale and to the fullest extent that is reasonably practicable without undue delay. The working statements of the invention undoubtedly give a concrete and clear idea about the effectiveness and commercial viability of an invention, they are important for valuation of patent portfolios and most importantly for issuance of compulsory licensing. Working statements are undeniably one of the important pillars to maintain the transparency of the system and help in preventing a blockage in the scope of creativity of inventions in the Indian patents regime.\nHaving said that, there is no doubt that the AWR system requires a relook. The threat of imprisonment and hefty monetary fines for non-filing of statement of working may be counterproductive to the growth of patent filings in India since it will be one of the aspects which patent applicants will consider while choosing India as a jurisdiction for patent protection. Moreover, it is not fair for hefty financial penalties to be imposed on patentees given that exemplary damages are not awarded against infringers in patent infringement lawsuits. Reforms are needed to ensure that business sensitive information is not published by the Patent Office under the garb of Form 27 requirements.\n C.L.A.

{"id": "129", "text": "Three weeks before the official end of tax season, the IRS has issued nearly 50 million tax refunds. But many others are still waiting for a refund. In addition, the agency has ait's processing from prior years — far more than the 1 million it usually has going into a tax season.\nHere's whymight be taking longer this year — and what taxpayers might do about it.\nWhy could tax refunds be delayed?\nThere are a number of reasons a refund might be held back. Math errors or simple typos are often responsible. Common mistakes the IRS has flagged as leading to delays include: selecting an incorrect filing status; forgetting to list all income including bank interest and unemployment compensation; not answering a question on trading cryptocurrency; or having a typo in your name, address, Social Security number or bank account number.\nThis year, the pandemic's Economic Impact Payments — also known as stimulus checks — are creating an extra hurdle for taxpayers, leading to a \"significantly higher error rate\" on returns, according to IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig.\nFilers will need to correctly enter any stimulus payments they received and the numbers will need to match up with IRS records. However, \"far more than 10 million\" Americans have put in numbers that don't match up, leading to delays, Rettig told Congress last week.\nOther delays are due to Congress changing the tax law to allow Americans to use 2019 or 2020 income to claim the Earned Income Tax Credit. This change took place after the IRS had already updated its IT systems for the 2021 tax year, Rettig noted, meaning that taxpayers who take advantage of that law will need to have their returns manually reviewed by an IRS staffer.\nUnderstaffing is also taking a toll, with shrinking headcount at the IRS close to levels not seen since 1974, according to Rettig.\nAlso, the IRS is taking longer to issue refunds for some returns filed for earlier years, the agency said. The IRS' website states that some tax returns for the 2020 year are taking longer to process and refunds are taking longer than 21 days to be issued.\nHow long will refunds be delayed?\nIn, the IRS issues most refunds within 21 days of processing a tax return. This year, tax pros aren't optimistic about that time frame.\n\"You're not going to get your money in two weeks, so don't have unrealistic expectations,\" said Robert Seltzer, a CPA based in Los Angeles.\nEven the IRS is warning taxpayers they may have to wait. The agency on its website \"cautions taxpayers not to rely on receiving a refund by a certain date, especially when making major purchases or paying bills.\"\nSeltzer advised taxpayers to start checking their refund status online three weeks after they've submitted their return.\nI filed an amended return for a past year — what should I do?\nThe IRS said it's taking longer to process tax returns for the 2020 tax year, and up to a month longer to process amended returns.\n\"It's taking us more than 20 weeks (instead of up to 16 weeks) to process amended returns,\" the agency said on its site. \"Do not file a second tax return or call the IRS,\" the agency said.\nTaxpayers who filed an amended return should be able to check its status online with the IRS as soon as about three weeks after the return was sent to the agency. It can take up to 20 weeks, or five months, for a return to be processed.\nSeltzer has several clients who are still waiting on refunds from the 2020 tax year, one of whom filed in late July. One of them had no choice but to file on paper, which prolongs the issuing of a refund, he noted.\n\"You really must take every step you can to file electronically, because paper returns literally go into a black hole; it takes forever to get them processed,\" he said.\nUnfortunately, amended returns are often the last priority for the IRS — even more so during a busy filing season, said financial columnist Michelle Singletary.\nHow can I find the status of my refund?\nThe IRS' \"where's my refund\" tool lets taxpayers check on the whereabouts of their refund.\nTo check, taxpayers will need their Social Security number or Individual Tax Filing Number, filing status and the exact dollar amount of their refund. Information is updated 24 hours after someone electronically files their return, and the status of refunds is updated once a day, usually overnight, according to the agency.\nStill, the tool is limited, the National Taxpayer Advocate noted in its latest report, because it doesn't explain the reason for a delay or what a taxpayer needs to do to fix a delayed return.\nWhen should I call the IRS?\nTaxpayers hoping to get a person on the phone will face an uphill battle. The agency last year answered only 1 in 9 phone calls, with an average hold time of 23 minutes, according to the National Taxpayer Advocate.\nThe IRS says taxpayers should call about their refund in just a few circumstances:\nWhen it has been longer than 21 days since the return was electronically filed.\nWhen it has been six weeks or more since the return was mailed.\nIf the \"Where's My Refund?\" tool instructs someone to contact the IRS.\nfor more features.", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}

{"id": "179", "text": "Volcano Erupts for Third Time on Reykjanes Peninsula in Iceland\nIn a startling turn of events, a volcano on the Reykjanes peninsula in southwestern Iceland has erupted for the third time since December. The eruption, which occurred on March 5, 2021, has brought forth lava fountains that reached an impressive height of 50 to 80 meters in certain areas. As a result, a volcanic plume rose approximately three kilometers above the fissure.\nThis powerful eruption caused bright orange molten rock to spew from fissures in the ground, captivating both locals and tourists alike. The flow of lava even managed to cross a road near the famed Blue Lagoon, resulting in the temporary closure of the luxury geothermal spa. Visitors and staff members were evacuated for safety reasons, as the volcanic activity posed a significant threat.\nAdditionally, the eruption led to a state of emergency being declared in the area. As the lava flowed over a pipe that carried geothermal water used to heat homes in the vicinity, it caused a burst. Consequently, more than 20,000 people were left without access to hot water, prompting authorities to take immediate action. The civil protection authority urged residents to conserve energy by limiting themselves to the use of one small electric heater per household to mitigate the risk of power outages.\nThis eruption is significant in the sense that it sheds light on a new era of seismic activity in the region. The Reykjanes peninsula had previously not experienced an eruption in eight centuries prior to this event. The area’s dormant state since the 13th century had lulled locals into a sense of complacency, but the recent volcanic activity serves as a jarring reminder of the region’s latent power.\nIceland, often referred to as the “Land of Fire and Ice,” is home to a staggering 33 active volcanic systems – the highest number in Europe. This is due to the country’s unique geographical position: it sits on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, a crack in the ocean floor that separates tectonic plates. These plates continuously shift and collide, resulting in the frequent volcanic activity that Iceland is known for.\nJust two months prior to this recent eruption, the Reykjanes peninsula witnessed another volcanic event in January 2021. Lasting around two days, that eruption prompted evacuations and caused damage to homes in the fishing town of Grindavik.\nAs the situation unfolds, authorities and scientists continue to closely monitor the volcanic activity, ensuring the safety of residents and visitors alike. The eruption serves as a stark reminder of the untamed forces of nature that lie beneath our feet and the need for constant vigilance in areas prone to volcanic activity.\n“Social media scholar.

{"id": "185", "text": "Do school dress codes perpetuate sexism, culture of rape?\nA growing movement argues that in attempting to create a conducive learning environment, dress codes value certain groups of people over others.\nStudents at Boston Latin School, the oldest public school in the United States, have petitioned to have the dress code changed, claiming that it shamed girls’ bodies and perpetuated rape culture.\nAs it stands, the school's dress code bans see-through garments, spaghetti straps, hats, and gang-related colors. Leggings were recently removed from that list after a student-initiated Change.org petition put pressure on the school administration to work with the students to adjust a dress code they deemed was sexist and discriminated against minorities.\n“The message I hope to send while we’re in here is that the business of education can coexist with a woman choosing what she wants to wear,” student Liliana Severin, who organized the Change.org petition, told CBS.\nAfter negotiating with students, Boston Latin School’s interim headmaster Michael Contompasis has agreed to allow students to wear leggings and revisit some of the other complaints at a later date.\n“We are very sensitive to the fact that we have kids here who are struggling with their own identity. We don’t want to create an environment where they feel uncomfortable,” Mr. Contompasis told the Boston Herald. “No one condones things that might be of serious consequence. We’re not picking on young women any more than we’re picking on young men.”\nIn addition to protesting the school’s support of a ”patriarchal society where men can decide whether a female’s clothing is appropriate or inappropriate,” according to the petition, students are also worried that the vague phrasing of “gang related clothing” will disproportionately target the school’s minority community.\nWhile school dress codes are nothing new, they got a boost in the past few decades as fear of gun violence in schools grew following the Columbine High School massacre in 1999.\n“Public schools have the responsibility to have safe and orderly schools that maintain an environment conducive to learning,” dress code proponent Dr. Larry Wilder wrote in a 2007 post, citing “benefits, such as decreasing violence and theft, preventing students from wearing gang-related colors to school, instilling student discipline, helping to resist peer pressure, helping students concentrate on academics, and aiding in recognition of intruders.”\nBut recently, a growing movement has argued that in attempting to create a conducive learning environment, dress codes value certain groups of people over others.\n“It's not really the formal dress code by itself that is so discriminatory, it’s the message behind the dress code,” Maggie Sunseri, who produced \"Shame: A Documentary on School Dress Code,\" told The Atlantic. “My principal constantly says that the main reason for [it] is to create a ‘distraction-free learning zone’ for our male counterparts.”\nDress code advocates note that boys wearing baggy pants, showing their underwear, can be a distraction in a classroom, too.\nMany girls say that the implication of these dress codes is that schools are more concerned with the boys' learning environment than the girls'. A dress code protest in New Jersey spawned the hashtag #ImMoreThanADistraction, which went viral and created a platform for girls to air their grievances with being pulled out of class to change clothes so as not to distract the boys.\nDress codes are typically divided along a gender binary, making it difficult for trans and gender non-conforming students. Additionally, hats and other head wear are often restricted by dress codes without taking into account religious minorities. Activists have complained that even when schools are working with cultural minorities and gender non-conforming students, the schools are making an exception rather than making acceptance the rule.\nThe Boston Latin School Change.org petition, and many similar campaigns at other schools, have also criticized the school dress codes for making girls responsible for preventing harassment from boys – logic that, they argue, contributes to rape culture where victims are blamed for dressing provocatively.\n“Often they report hearing phrases like, ‘boys will be boys,’ from teachers,” Laura Bates, a co-founder of The Everyday Sexism Project, told The Atlantic. “There’s a real culture being built up through some of these dress codes where girls are receiving very clear messages that male behavior, male entitlement to your body in public space is socially acceptable, but you will be punished.”", "scores": {"score": 3, "score_transform_1": 5, "score_transform_2": 5, "score_transform_3": 0}}
{"id": "212", "text": "Before we head out for our annual holiday break and bid farewell to 2022, we want to take a few moments to celebrate the past year and extend our heartfelt gratitude to you, our players, for making it all possible.\n2022 was a fantastic year for Guild Wars 2, and it started off with a bang. On February 28, we released our third expansion, Guild Wars 2: End of Dragons™, which brought a climactic end to the elder dragon saga (spoiler!). The team poured their heart and soul into bringing a reimagined Cantha to life, and in the end, we delivered an experience that we’re incredibly proud of.\nBut the expansion is just one part of this year’s story. Living World Season 1—which had previously been unplayable for over eight years—returned as a free and permanent addition to the base game. We delivered significant quality-of-life gameplay improvements for both new players and veterans, with more to come. We made considerable progress on long-term initiatives like the DirectX11 upgrade and WvW World Restructuring, and we renewed our focus on regularly refreshing key gameplay systems like combat. And we released Guild Wars 2 on Steam, putting Tyria on the map for an entirely new group of gamers.\nWe’ve also reinforced our commitment to being transparent and communicating regularly with all of you, with regular studio updates, quarterly roadmaps, and balance preview livestreams. In the background, we’ve been working quietly on our next content update, and we began early development on our fourth expansion. In the midst of everything, we celebrated the 10th anniversary of Guild Wars 2‘s original release—an achievement only made possible by the support of our community.\nAll of this paid off in a big way. Back in April, we reported that our active player count had more than doubled over the past few years and that Guild Wars 2: End of Dragons had already outsold our previous expansion, Guild Wars 2: Path of Fire™. Today, we’re excited to share a new accomplishment. This year we’ve already seen more players venture into Tyria for the first time since 2015— the year we made the base game content playable for free and launched our first expansion, Guild Wars 2: Heart of Thorns™. This has been one of the best years for Guild Wars 2 in recent memory, and we’re eager to keep building on that momentum.\nWe’ll be back early next year to talk about our Q1 plans, which include wrapping up the DirectX11 transition, continuing work on World vs. World, upgrading our in-game browser technology from Coherent to Chromium Embedded Framework, and of course new Guild Wars 2: End of Dragons content. We’re also looking forward to sharing our long-term vision and plans for the game.\nThank you all for a fantastic 2022. Let’s do it again next year.\nHave a wonderful Wintersday!\n—The Guild Wars 2 Team", "scores": {"score": 0, "score_transform_1": 0, "score_transform_2": 0, "score_transform_3": 1}}

{"id": "297", "text": "If you Google “How to Hire a Financial Advisor,” you’ll find thousands of articles, tons of advice and a plethora of opinions.\nThe main theme of all of the articles seems to guide consumers to hire a CFP and they should be fee-only. Those two criteria may be a great fit for you or it might not be…it depends on the advisor.\nThe other piece of advice almost every article provides is a list of the questions they feel you should ask while interviewing the advisor.\nThis is a bad idea in our opinion because it takes the advisor off the hook. It would be pretty easy to give you the answer he or she feels you want to hear and frankly, you’d probably never know the difference from one advisor to the next.\nThat’s why we developed this formula, so that anyone can interview a financial advisor and easily be able to separate the wheat from the chaff. The very first thing to understand is that you are listening for what the advisor doesn’t say, just as much as you are listening to what he or she does say during your first appointment.\nVery good advisors will have a process they utilize for every meeting. Which means they know what they are going to say, they have rehearsed what they are going to say, and they plan to deliver their very best effort because they know there may not be a second meeting unless you are impressed and feel comfortable with them.\nWhat the advisor says during the first meeting will encompass their best practices, and their unique abilities. What they say here is what they feel separates them from other advisors. In other words, it’s what they feel is their best stuff.\nIn other words, If they don’t tell you exactly how they get paid (you should not have to ask), the odds are that you may never know and that’s probably not a good way to start a business relationship.\nIf the main focus of the conversation is on their investment process and reviewing your investment statements then there is a very large chance that they won’t be helping you to understand your estate plan or whether your family will be okay in the event of a premature death because they would have told you about their other areas of expertise or focus.\nIf there isn’t talk of a financial planning process then it’s probably safe to say they don’t have a comprehensive financial planning process. If your personal net worth is under $500,000 then it may not matter to you if the advisor will be comprehensive or not. If your net worth exceeds $500,000…don’t think twice about it, find a comprehensive financial planner that will integrate all of the areas of your financial plan so that everything is fully coordinated.\nThey say actions speak louder than words, correct? This next cue to watch for is better than any words the advisor may speak.\nWhat documents of yours does the planner want to look at prior to taking you on as a new client? If they only ask to see your investment statements there is a good chance that the focus of their practice is on investment management and not financial planning.\nOn the other hand, if they ask to see your wills and trusts, tax returns and business documents (buy sell agreement or operating agreement), as well as, your investment statements…I’d say there is a much better chance that they will help you with all of those things. Remember, it’s vitally important that your advisor takes a comprehensive approach because of the interactions between all of the areas of your financial life.\nTax reduction strategies is just as important as investment planning because taxes can erode your returns if you’re not careful. The wrong beneficiary on your IRA or life insurance could change your entire estate plan. Financial planning is complicated and it should always be done in a holistic and comprehensive manner.\nIf you only did those two things…listen to what they are saying (and not saying) and watching for which documents they ask for, you’ll have an advantage over other consumers looking to hire a new advisor. On the other hand, if you want to hold out for the very best financial planners, then there are three other things that you can do to really know that you are hiring the best fit advisor for your family.\nIf they don’t offer to do this, I might walk away but you should always get a written engagement proposal. This document should include the advisors initial observations about your financial situation based on the four sets of documents we listed above (wills and trusts, income tax return, buy sell agreement or operating agreement and your investment statements).\nThink about this is: what if the advisor tells you during the first meeting that they take a comprehensive approach to financial planning? Yet, during the next meeting the engagement proposal they prepared focuses on what they feel is wrong with your investment portfolio. It tells you they probably don’t practice comprehensive financial planning.\nThe engagement proposal should have several items in each category of planning: estate, personal risk management, tax reduction strategies, investment, retirement and business owner planning.\nIf the engagement proposal has all of those areas covered then you should expect that a sample financial plan from the advisor would have all of those areas taken care of as well. A sample should be relatively easy for an advisor to produce.\nAll you have to do is look at the recommendations of the financial plan or at the implementation portion of the plan to see whether the wealth advisor is taking a comprehensive approach to financial planning, or not.\nThe final thing you want to know is what the financial advisor does during an annual review. Ask to see what they would bring to an annual review.\nHere again, if the documents are all focused on portfolio returns and your asset allocation, then don’t you think you might be close to hiring an investment advisor? The annual review should include a visual depicting where the client’s present situation is versus the projections that were made in the financial plan.\nThat’s what you want to hire a financial planner for isn’t it? You want them to help you create a plan and then to review your progress towards your financial goals and objectives. It would be wise to make sure they review your goals and objectives, your estate plan and your business transition plan if you own a company.\nThat’s it! Look and listen for those five things and you will be heads above anyone else looking to hire a financial advisor, wealth advisor or financial planner.\nOn another note, there isn’t anything wrong with hiring an investment advisor. It may seem like we are poking at advisors that focus on the investments (okay…maybe a little) but the truth is that your financial life is complicated and you really aren’t doing your family any favors if you find an investment advisor who may lose most of your wealth to income taxes, estate taxes or they die prematurely before they can build their nest egg. Or any other host of issues that can be presented to you over time.\nHire an advisor that takes a comprehensive approach to financial planning so that they are watching out for all the things that you don’t even know could be an issue.", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}
{"id": "299", "text": "Maybe you have identified yourself telling lies in mattress at night, fighting to go to sleep? Or even feeling completely tired during the day, and questioning reasons why you can’t manage to shake off of the low energy? Sleep is an important element of our lives, however it’s still not completely realized. Somnology, or perhaps the science of sleep, is definitely an fascinating discipline that’s dedicated to unraveling the secrets of your slumbering human brain. In this particular blog post, we’ll consider a closer look at somnology and explore a number of the sleep specialist.\nTo start with, it’s crucial that you understand what transpires with our bodies while sleeping. Whilst we’re snoozing away, our brains embark on complicated procedures that assist us combine thoughts, normalize our sensations, repair tissue, plus more. Probably the most intriguing aspects of somnology research is the research into the steps of sleep at night, which can be split into two main groups: quick eye movements (REM) sleep and non-speedy eyes motion (NREM) sleeping. During REM rest, our mind are highly energetic and our eye transfer quickly, although our muscle tissue come to be temporarily paralyzed in order to avoid us from acting out our dreams. NREM sleep at night, on the other hand, is split into four steps, with each point observed as another degree of head action and muscle relaxing.\nAn additional area of somnology research that’s gained plenty of consideration in recent times is sleeping problems. These may range from frequent concerns like sleeping disorders and sleep apnea, to rarer conditions like narcolepsy and REM rest behavior disorder. Several of these conditions are related to interruptions inside the regular sleeping period, which can lead to signs or symptoms such as excessive daytime sleepiness, heavy snoring, or repeated waking at night time.

{"id": "300", "text": "When Omaha-based photographer Geoff Johnson was a child, he would hide silently behind the front door of his house whenever someone came to visit, emerging only after they turned their backs so as to obscure their view of the interior of his house. This, he explains, was one way of coping with his mother’s compulsive hoarding.\nDuring his childhood and adolescence, Johnson and his sister lived in a house without a working refrigerator, air conditioner, or running water outside of the bathtub, with few places to eat amongst the encroaching debris. For Behind the Door, the photographer returns to that house for the first time in two decades, sifting through and photographing what remains.\nRevisiting the house for the first time since his departure in 1995, Johnson found the house almost exactly as it had been during his youth, the major difference being its current state of abandonment. Instead of capturing merely the residue of his former home, the photographer traces the lived experience of himself and his sister by casting in their place his son and her daughter, who were edited into the images, as the house was not safe for them to visit in person.\nAfter years of avoiding the house’s interior, Johnson’s homecoming brought with it a flood of emotions, and at times he was hurled back into the mind of his forgotten self. When a neighbor he recognized approached, he stiffened as he had done a quarter century before. Family pictures lay exposed and unframed on surfaces, and he says, “the fear and vulnerability” stayed with him as he made his way from room to room.\nJohnson’s re-entrance into the house, he says, has allowed him to reopen—and ultimately to heal— old wounds. Though he is able to access those long-ago memories, he was able to return fortified with the passing of the years. As an adult, he has gathered an understanding of the situation that eluded him as a child. After many conversations with his mother during her lifetime, photographing the home has empowered him to recognize, to heal, and perhaps most of all, to forgive what happened in the past.\nOccasionally, he and his sister have brought up their childhoods with their own kids, but he admits that for now, they’re too young to grasp it. Johnson isn’t sure how exactly those years marked his growth and the course of his life, except that it has instilled within him a firm idea of what home should be. “My house now is a place I want my kids to feel safe and welcomed,” says the artist.\nBehind the Door was created in collaboration with digital artist Randy Teet and assistant Jennifer McShea.\nAll images © Geoff Johnson", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}

These Brethren may be exclusive, but the media exposure has been anything but. Media outlets of all shapes are clambering over eachother for the definitive headline exposé.

Not many know that from the Land of Papua, several heroes were generated who had an important role for Indonesia’s independence. And here are five National Heroes from the Land of Papua:\n1. Silas Papare\nSilas Papare is one of the National Heroes from Papua who is persistent in fighting for the return of Papua to the Republic of Indonesia. He was born in Ariepi Village, Serui, Yapen Waropen on December 18, 1918.\nSilas Papare’s goal was to end Dutch power in his ancestral lands and maintain its independence.

Whether it’s swimming laps to get your fitness levels up, teaching your little ones how to swim or floating around with a beer in your hand, pools can offer up a great reprieve from the infamous Aussie summer.\nIt’s no secret that pools also take time, money and effort to maintain. Sometimes, it can start to feel like more effort than it’s worth, especially if you and your family aren’t getting as much use out of it as you’d like. If you’re looking to spruce up your poolside area and get the most out of your investment, there are a few tricks you can pull to make it more inviting and fun than ever. Here are 5 ways you can enhance your poolside for the summertime and make it fun again for the whole family.\n- Upgrade your poolside furniture\nLots of people are hesitant to invest in poolside furniture, worried that it’ll quickly deteriorate and become weathered over time. While this is true in some cases, there are several high-quality options out there that require minimal maintenance and are built to withstand the elements.\nTeak outdoor furniture is a popular choice for these very reasons, being resistant to the effects of rain, sunlight, storms, pests and mould and mildew. Its impressive strength and durability make it an ideal addition to any poolside area, and it’s built to last whatever our wild weather throws at it.\n- Add lights to your pool\nWe all love using our pools during the day, but why not get the most out of it at night, too? Adding LED lights in your pool is a great way to keep things safe for a late-night swim, illuminating your pool and the surrounding garden at a low cost.\nThis can also add an exciting visual element to your pool at night, with the option to install light with different colours, patterns and brightness for the ultimate experience that enhances your pool’s beauty.\n- Add greenery to your poolside area\nAdding greenery around your pool can help give it a tropical and tranquil feeling, giving the feeling of the ultimate staycation and your own little paradise in your backyard. Whether it’s a vertical garden running alongside the edge of your pool or even just potted plants on the poolside can go a long way with minimal effort involved.\nJust make sure to get plants that can survive the harsher conditions that come with being poolside, like the direct sunlight and reflection off the water. Frangipanis, star jasmines and agave attenuates are all solid options that will add some flair and excitement to your poolside with minimal TLC.\n- Make it multi-purpose\nAnother way to get some more use out of your pool is to make it multi-purpose. Something like a meditation spot or a picnic area can be a fantastic way to utilise the relaxation that a pool can offer, even if the weather’s not warm enough for a dip.\nIf you have the space, you can even create space for home workouts by your poolside. This allows you to get some fresh air and open space while you exercise, rather than trying to awkwardly do your workout in your bedroom or living area.\n- Ensure routine cleaning\nIt may not be much fun, but the proper care and maintenance of your pool will go a long way in getting as much use out of it as possible. Getting in the habit of routinely testing the water and adding chemicals as necessary, checking and cleaning out the filter, vacuuming the bottom of the pool and keeping the pump running are all essential factors in keeping it clean and safe.\nIn terms of the poolside area, regularly sweeping, maintaining the greenery and keeping the pool fence clean are also relatively quick and easy tasks you can do to keep everything looking in top shape.", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

Every year, people all around the world, get together and get their beloved Czech made motorcycles – the indomitable proud JAWA, or Czech-inspired motorcycles such as the YEZDI in India – out on the roads ! Why you may ask? Well its a day when the owners and riders would love to show off their possessions, show the world that these grand machines – that possibly once ruled the roads, not just in India, but in countries of Europe, as well as other continents – are still in use and after all these years, can still mark their presence.\nOn the lighter side, some feel that the owners all round the world would like to make a circle of blue smoke, if just for a little while. But whatever it is, some like to ride in groups, some like to ride solo, some prefer to have city based events – its all a gathering of people and public, who can appreciate those beauties from an era gone by. Close to 80 bikes, including 14 from Bengaluru, 50 from Mangaluru, 18 from Udupi, 2 from Mysuru, 1 each from Moodbidri, Kasargod, Madikeri (rode by a female), and Puttur, converged at the Panambur Beach Parking area, with special emphasis on Road Safety Awareness complete with a quiz programme, competitions and a presentation, to help educate the members of the Motorcycling Community of the importance of Road Safety in their daily lives.\nBack in 2003, when the idea of having an International Jawa Day, by the Jawa CZ Owners Club in the UK, was first born – with the thought of showing everybody that “look, these motorcycles are still in use, and people still love riding them”, they might have never thought that in the very second year, the fever had already spread across continents to the Czech Republic, Germany, the US, South Africa, Australia and Canada ,even if it was just 3 -5 serious riders. They might never have thought that in the 17th International Jawa Day, the numbers would have shot dramatically to such an extent, that India itself was religiously celebrating in almost all major cities and metros – today – the 14th July – the name Jawa & Yezdi that has stubbornly stood against all odds, so much so that the Jawa made its presence felt in the market, with its new-gen bikes, that still felt like Classics!\nMaybe bigger cities like Bengaluru have the opportunity and the numbers that made them anticipate around 700 Jawa & Yezdi motorcycles in their Jawa Day celebrations. But cities like Mangaluru and Udupi, are no less, even if their numbers are small. As per Shawn Fernandez, the coordinator of Mangaluru Jawa Yezdi Motorcyle Club, “The Udupi Jawa Yezdi Motorcycle Club (U.J.Y.M.C.) decided to have their celebrations on Saturday evening – the 13th July and invitations were sent to all clubs and friends and riders around. For this, around 11 members from the Mangalore Club, got ready at 1.30 pm and rode out in the rain to join their friends in Udupi. With their prominent chief guests from the Manipal Auto Club, among others, the entire event was well taken care off, especially since they stressed on the importance of Helmets and other safety aspects. There would have been easily around 45 Jawa & Yezdi motorcycles for this evening session, following which the Mangaluru riders all rode back together!”\nBut on Sunday morning, for one, the riders from Bengaluru, part of the Kings Raid team, had decided to ride down and be a part of the celebrations in both the twin cities. Together with them a couple of riders from Mysore and Madikeri had also come down, plus a team from Udupi were on their way by now. By around 8.30 am, the venue was ready and available at Panambur Beach parking, thanks to a number of key people. Refreshments were served to all, following which, as soon as the 18 + member riding team from Udupi had joined in, mementoes were handed over to the Circle Inspector Mohan and his associate Raghavendra, Yatish Bykampady, Director of the Panambur Beach Development Authority Project and his close friend Raju, A warm welcome was given to all riders, especially the out-of-town ones.\nWithout wasting time, what immediately followed was an interesting session, compered by Ahmed – a rider from Bengaluru, who was technical based and had in-depth knowledge about these motorcycles. Common issues and problems faced by riders and owners were discussed and questions and answers went back and forth, making it quite an interesting session. When the rains came down, and pushed everybody back into the Golden Reef restaurant, the outdoor activities were kept on hold and instead, a dumb charade combination was held under the shelter. Five teams were selected and each team was given 2 minutes to speak about any particular item of importance. While one person would explain details, importance and need of this, the other person would enact the dialogue, mono acting style.\nThis of course led to quite a hilarious display of explanations, but the key riders who took first place were Vinay and Keshav from the Bangalore team, on their demonstration of helmets and riding gears, while riding! The rains gave a respite and the people were once again ready for the next round outdoors.\nEvent 1 – Push your bike – as a team -……..backwards – this showed the importance of teamwork together with skills. The bike faces in the reverse direction and the pillion rider also faces backwards. On cue, they set off, pushing the bike with their legs on the ground, while firmly seated and the rider who is seated facing forward has to navigate using his skills and the directions of his pillion rider. The winners here were riders from the Jawa tribe – the new gen 4-stroke 300 cc motorcycles, Ajesh and Sachin.\nEvent 2 – the evergreen slow race, but different categories for both new as well as old bikes. Roshan Shetty from Udupi won first place in the old Jawa & Yezdi motorcycles, while Ajesh won in the new-gen motorcycles. Prize winners were awarded mementos, together with riders from other cities who had come in. A total of around 80 motorcycles were present, among which were 6 – Old Jawa 250 and 1 Jawa 350 – one of the oldest Jawas was a 1966 model, immaculately owned by Prem Rasquinha, complete with snow guards; 2 – Yezdi 350s; 9 – new Jawas and Jawa 42’s assorted models of the Ideal Jawa Company from Mysuru – B-type, D250 Classic, Deluxe 250, Cl 11s, Roadkings.\nThe event ended on a high note – with all riders lining up and riding out in single formation, so as not to inconvenience the public as well as locals, while heading towards Chitrapur Beach, Kulur, where everybody lined up together for a group picture against the beauty of the stormy beach, before everybody dispersed towards their respective places! Definitely a day well spent – that was the 17th International Yezdi Jawa Day celebrated in fun and frolic in the vicinity of Panambur Beach! !\nWith inputs from Shawn fernandez- coordinator of Mangaluru Jawa Yezdi Motorcyle Club", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}
{"id": "574", "text": "Science is what we understand well enough to explain to a computer. Art is everything else we do.\n~ Donald Knuth\nYou’ll never appreciate the true complexity of a mundane, everyday task, until you’ve tried explaining it to a computer.\nContrary to popular perception, computers are not smart. Actually, they are stone dumb. Given a lengthy set of precise instructions, your computer can follow them well enough, most of the time, but when asked to exhibit the tiniest bit of reasoning or creativity, your cutting-edge laptop PC is helpless and hopeless. Ditto for the Mac. Sorry, Linux won’t help either.\nConsider the simple act of making a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. You can teach the average six year-old child this skill in a few minutes; writing the equivalent instructions for a general-purpose computer could literally take weeks or months of effort.\nKnowing all this, I was amazed by the concept and promise of Spike TV’s new show, Deadliest Warrior:\nIn Los Angeles, CA, we’ve created a high-tech fight club, with scientists, martial arts experts, and lots and lots of weapons. It’s all here to create a virtual battle between two legendary warriors. We’ll test their weapons and fighting techniques on high-tech dummies—stand-ins for human victims. Based on this data, a battle simulation program will stage a true-to-life fight to the death. The winner will be The Deadliest Warrior.\nCould it possibly be true? Would the endless debates over the ultimate fighting style finally be put to rest, by indisputable scientific evidence?\nAs it turns out, Deadliest Warrior devotes the majority of its screen time to slashing, stabbing and smashing test dummies with period weapons. The remainder is split between historical reenactment scenes, and bull sessions with their resident martial arts historians. Sadly, for those of us with an interest in the simulator itself, the show never describes its operation.\nSlitherine Software UK, creators of Deadliest Warrior’s battle modeler, would not agree to an interview. So instead, I will take a wild stab at assessing how the software works, and whether it meets its promise as a scientific and objective judge of human warriors.\nThe Genesis of the Deadliest Warrior Sim\nAccording to the SpikeTV’s producers, a team of programmers spent five years developing the Deadliest Warrior simulation engine. This is not precisely correct. Slitherine Software created a real-time strategy game—The History Channel’s Great Battles of Rome—and later tweaked this game for the specific use of the Deadliest Warrior program.\nGreat Battles of Rome is a role-playing game, with some references to true historical events. It does not, and is not intended to simulate the reality of ancient warfare in authentic detail. As in other RTS games, the game player serves as general over an army of semi-autonomous battle units, each possessing unique strengths, weaknesses, and methods of attack. Play consists of directing strategy and tactics, advance and retreat, to capture territory and defeat the forces of the opponent.\nTroop types in GBoR include light and heavy infantry, archers, cavalry and war elephants. Cavalry presumably move faster than elephants, but are less powerful against a lone soldier; archers can attack safely from longer distances, but are handicapped by forest terrain; and so on.\nThese game rules were reworked for use on Deadliest Warrior. Instead of pitting two groups of one thousand warriors against each other in one giant battle, the software matches up two single warriors—an archetypal ninja and Spartan, or samurai and Viking raider—for one thousand consecutive matches.\nWhy repeat the same match one thousand times? Why can’t this high-tech computer simulation compute the correct results on the first try? The simple answer is that neither the simulation, nor its creators know how to do so.\nEnter the Monte Carlo algorithm. Instead of dictating fixed values for each fighter’s metrics—their speed and agility, the range and power of their weapons, et cetera—the programmers define a range of possible values. The computer then runs a series of test cases, using random numbers that fall within those ranges. After sufficient test cases have been run, the computer aggregates the results to guess the most probable real-life conclusion.\nWith a random number generator determining the outcome of these battles, one might assume fairness and objectivity; but that would be a mistake. Underneath the Deadliest Warrior’s fancy wire-frame graphics and state-of-the-art ballistic weapons measurements, lies a set of flawed assumptions that destroy the show’s claims to scientific validity.\nNinja vs. Spartan\nAs any experienced martial artist can tell you, the fighting tactics shown in the final reenactments are laughable. On the show, “computer whiz” Max Geiger explains these episodes as dramatized composites of a sober statistical analysis; but in fact, the analysis itself is probably no closer to reality.\nRandom numbers alone do not make a battle. Remember that the computer does not know how to fight, nor is it capable of learning this independently. In the end, it can only follow instructions.\nCan you guess who wrote those instructions? (I’ll give you a hint: it wasn’t the International Ninja Council.)\nUltimately, these “scientific rules” of warfare were written not by experienced warriors, but by a group of programmers; and with the initial constraint that they should be simple enough to produce an entertaining computer game (Great Battles of Rome).\nTheoretically, the Monte Carlo method might compensate for the programmers’ inability to identify the single most important factor in these warriors’ battle. (If we knew the answer to that question, there would be no need for a simulation.) Instead, they attempted to identify twenty different factors that could affect the outcome, and all the paths through which these factors can interact. In other words, they attempted to reduce mastery of the martial arts to a straightforward mathematical equation, and draw “scientific” conclusions from the use of that equation.\nUnderstand that the art of fighting is not an output from this simulation; it is an input. It is not an experimental result, but a set of assertions written by software engineers. Whether or not these assertions are prima facie reasonable is irrelevant; dojo novices quickly learn that “reasonable” is not a working martial art. (Incidentally, this may explain why no computer scientists have yet won a UFC title.)\nConsidering the hidden complexity of the peanut butter and jelly sandwich, you might assume that a proper martial arts simulator would require many years of careful design, with input from experts in the fields of software engineering and martial arts. You would be correct.\nDoes Spike TV’s Deadliest Warrior reflect this disciplined approach to the intractable problem of single combat?\nI can answer that in three words: severed pig carcasses.", "scores": {"score": 3, "score_transform_1": 5, "score_transform_2": 5, "score_transform_3": 0}}

I do quite like to be the centre of attention so any of these would have been more than acceptable but then dementia struck and it seemed that my big birthday was going to be so very boring and I was full of disappointment. Gradually though I've worked my way through the fog and decided that it's up to me to decide whether life, and birthdays, are to be boring or as exciting as they would be if life was normal. With that in mind then I began to make different plans for my birthday and came up with the idea of a new car. Then I decided to arrange to pick it up on the actual day and suddenly the birthday was fun again. Since then friends, of whom there are many and every one of them wonderful, have been popping up with ideas so that now the birthday which had gone from huge and potentially glamourous to small and flat now consists of several days of fun including a long walk followed by lunch at a favourite coffee bar; sunrise at the beach followed by breakfast; a trip to Jake's and lunch out with the nearly 7 year old and associated adults; car collection with Ash, a drive round the countryside and possibly lunch out if he's up to it; tea on the field in front of the house; another lunch and on and on it seems. The birthday that once I'd relegated to the back of my mind so as not to be disappointed is turning out to be a week of treats that I'm looking forward to with undisguised glee and it's all depended on a change of perspective and the enthusiasm of those around me.", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

This isn’t just a courtesy to the new owners, it’s also a good opportunity to double-check that you haven’t left anything behind.\n- Surfaces: Dust and wipe down all surfaces, including window sills, doorknobs, and baseboards. You should also clean all the outlets and light switches. You’d be surprised at how grimy those can be, especially outlets that were behind furniture and weren’t regularly cleaned.\n- Windows: You may have already cleaned the windows when you were preparing to show your home to potential buyers. However, it’s a good idea to give them another once-over.\n- Bathrooms and kitchen: These will be the center of your cleaning focus. You should allow enough time to thoroughly clean your bathrooms and kitchen. Pay special attention to your kitchen appliances, particularly the stove and refrigerator.\nThe New House\nHopefully, the previous owners of your new home were as considerate as you when they moved out. But no matter how well they cleaned, you’ll want to give certain areas a quick clean before your family is ready to move in.\n- Kitchen and bathrooms: Moving in can shake up a lot of dirt. So you’ll want to make sure your kitchen and bathrooms are clean before you’re ready to use them.\n- Garage: If the house has a garage or shed, you’ll want to sweep it out before you fill it with your stuff. You’ll never get a better opportunity!\n- Floors: Finally, sweep, mop, and vacuum your floors before you set up your furniture.

{"id": "629", "text": "Common Plumbing Problems Caused By Clogged Gutters\nGutters are an integral part of any home, and without them, there are some plumbing problems you could stumble into. It’s not just good enough to have gutters though, you need to keep them clean, too. As an experienced Maryland plumber, we wanted to take some time today to discuss some of the most common plumbing problems caused by clogged gutters.\nWhen your gutters are clogged it means the water has nowhere to go. A gallon of water weighs roughly 8 pounds, and all of the extra weight of the water can destroy a gutter. It’s much easier to clear the clog than to repair an entire gutter system, but if your gutters are already damaged, then you’ll need some help from an Eldersburg, Maryland plumber.\nProblems With Your Foundation\nWhen your gutters aren’t properly draining, your home’s foundation is at risk. Water will pool in your gutters and overflow, running down the walls of your home and into your foundation. All of this excess water can cause erosion, which weakens the walls of your home and can crack the foundation.\nThis isn’t as big of a problem during the colder months of the year, but water pooled in your gutters can lead to some troublesome mosquitoes during the summer. Mosquitoes lay their eggs in stagnant pools of water, and will gladly make your gutters their home or breeding ground. Nobody wants to have to deal with mosquitoes and their bites, so keeping the gutters clear is vital.\nJust like with the foundation, water can also overflow down the walls of your house and seep into your basement. Once your basement is damp and has that mildew smell, it can be extremely difficult to get rid of it, as well as unsafe for the health of you and your family. That’s why your best is cleaning your gutters and preventing this from happening in the first place.\nWork With a Professional Westminster, MD Plumber\nHere at Michael Runk Plumbing and Heating, we’ve been providing our plumbing services to Westminster, Eldersburg, Sykesville, and many other areas of Maryland for years. If you’re having trouble with your gutters, or have any plumbing questions at all, don’t worry, you’re not alone. Our team of Maryland plumbing professionals is standing by ready to help you in any way possible.

{"id": "632", "text": "Two years ago, startup ShoCard secured $1.5 million in seed funding based on a single but provocative identity management idea: Prove it.\n“As more and more of our activities tie into the cloud, proving your identity has become an everyday task,” Jeff Weitzman, a ShoCard co-founder who’s no longer with the company, told attendees at the May, 2015 TechCrunch Startup Battlefield competition in New York. “We need something as simple for consumers to understand and use as showing their driver’s license.. something so secure a bank can rely on it,” he said.\nHence the developer’s eponymous launch product, a virtual identity card platform that consumers use through a mobile app, built on top of the public blockchain data layer. Its B2B use cases, which initially were for bank and credit card identification processes, have since widened to credit-reporting companies, airlines and companies requiring user logins for websites and apps.\nShoCard Raises Venture Funding\nNow ShoCard has set its sights on bigger prizes, garnering $4 million in venture funding to steer its new ShoBadge platform to enterprises. This Series A capital infusion was led by existing investors Morado and AME Cloud Ventures, with new backers Storm Ventures, Danhua Capital, Correlation Ventures, Recruit Strategic Partners and Robert Tinker, founder and former CEO of MobileIron.\nWith ShoBadge, employee ID information is stored encrypted on the employee’s mobile device, then verified through the blockchain, creating user-centric identity storage and paving the way toward a Bring Your Own Identity (BYOID) policy, the company said.\nThe idea is to eliminate easily compromised usernames and passwords traditionally used to gain access to the network and data, instead using a blockchain-based digital identity verification and authentication process.\n\"Eliminating usernames and passwords at the enterprise level will close the security gap in organizations' cyber defenses,” Armin Ebrahimi, ShoCard founder and CEO said. “Large databases filled with this sensitive information will no longer be necessary, and weak passwords, easily exploited by hackers, will no longer exist.”\nShoCard: Partner Opportunities?\nThe ShoBadge platform, which is intended to complement an existing single sign-on process, extends beyond employee ID management to partners, sales channels, contractors and third-parties needing access to an enterprise’s systems.\nIt’s here where partners may have a play, depending, of course, on ShoCard’s interest in broadening the reach of its platform beyond what it can touch on its own. In that regard, the company may have somewhat of a ready-made template. Late last year, IBM launched a Blockchain partner ecosystem that includes systems integrators, independent software vendors and enterprise developers.\nIBM’s thinking is to accelerate the goal of Blockchain networks, theoretically driving more value as each new Blockchain partner or service joins the ecosystem.\nIt’s early but there’s promise for partners. ShoCard’s VC investors may have a similar inkling.", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

{"id": "772", "text": "As an anthropologist and health services researcher who is interested in patient-provider communication, I (GF) observe clinical encounters. I get to see the diverse ways conversations between patients and their providers unfold. In particular, I‘m interested in the “patient-centeredness” of conversations. Did the provider demonstrate empathy? Was the patient treated like a unique person? Did the patient and provider collaboratively develop a personalized care plan?\nI’ve been struck by how different conversations can be, ranging from highly patient-centered and attuned to broader socio-cultural contexts to highly biomedical and focused almost exclusively on whether patients take their medications or follow other recommendations. In the latter scenario, patients are not asked about their unique contexts. Thus, care plans are unlikely to match their lives, reducing the likelihood recommendations are followed.\nIn our recent work examining conversations between patients and their providers, we noticed variation across eight HIV clinics. The clinics fell into two types: “socio-culturally attuned” or “individually responsible.” At socio-culturally attuned clinics, providers thought about patients’ contexts. We heard a provider talk with a patient with HIV about strategies to conceive, a potentially sensitive topic. Another provider asked about a patient’s gambling. And still others were attuned to patients’ challenges getting to medical appointments because of unreliable transportation or unstable housing.\nOne provider asked a patient about taking his medications by saying, “I know you’re a good guy, so no problems with your meds?”\nIn contrast, at the individually responsible clinics, we observed providers effectively stop patients from talking about their health or their lives. These providers focused the conversations on whether patients took their medications. One provider asked a patient about taking his medications by saying, “I know you’re a good guy, so no problems with your meds?” This left the patient with only one answer. Good patients (and good people) take their medications. A provider at another clinic asked a patient if he was “behaving,” implying that good patients are like good children and do what they are told. They take their medication.\nNotably, we saw consistency within each clinic, indicative of the clinic’s overall culture. In the clinics where we observed socio-culturally oriented appointments, we heard about patients’ housing, transportation and relationships, across our interview and observation data. At the clinics where we observed appointments focused on medication adherence and little or no conversation about patients’ lives, we found a broader culture in which providers perceived their patients as individually responsible for their health behaviors. In our interviews with these providers, we heard them describe patients who were perceived of as not taking their medications as “flakes” or “disasters.” These patients were seen as personally culpable and morally fallible. This perspective can prevent further conversations about how to plan care and diminishes the important role patients can and should play.\nIn the clinics where patients were seen as individually responsible for their health, providers’ judgmental approaches may be a defense mechanism to stave off uncomfortable conversations.\nMost importantly, we found a relationship between the clinic culture and the composition of the care team. Clinics that included social workers and mental health providers—professions commonly attuned to patients’ non-biomedical needs—were more attuned to patients’ life contexts. In the clinics where providers functioned independently, with limited access to social workers or mental health providers, patients were perceived as either good or bad individuals based on their abilities to adhere to their medications.\nIn the clinics where patients were seen as individually responsible for their health, providers’ judgmental approaches may be a defense mechanism to stave off uncomfortable conversations. If you hear a patient has problems with housing, relationships, or substance use, but feel ill-equipped to address these challenges, having this conversation may simply raise a sense of inadequacy or powerlessness.\nIt would have been easy, as researchers, to document the judgmental language we heard and conclude that these were “bad” providers. However, our ethnographic approach allowed us to instead think about the culture of HIV care. Just as it is critical for providers to recognize and address challenges patients face in their daily lives, we need to think about providers in the context within which they work. If we want providers to have more patient-centered conversations with their patients, we need to provide them with resources to which they can refer patients when life challenges inevitably arise.", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}

They work almost exactly as the name suggests, with players spinning reels to make the right combinations and win prizes.\nThey can be a fun and exciting way to pass the time, but they can also be very addictive, especially when playing penny slots. However, it is important to set a budget for yourself before you start playing and stick to it.\nPenny slots are a variation of regular slot games and they offer a lower maximum bet per spin. They are typically free to play, although some do require a minimum amount of lines that must be activated for each spin.\nWhen playing penny slots, you need to keep in mind that the chances of winning big are very small. Whether you’re playing online or in a land-based casino, make sure to manage your bankroll wisely and limit your losses.\nIf you’re a beginner, you might want to start with low-limit games and increase your bet size as you get more experience. This will help you avoid a gambling addiction and will allow you to win more money in the long run.\nChoosing the Right Penny Slots for You\nThere are several types of slots on the market, but one of the most popular is the penny slot. These games allow you to bet as little as a penny per spin, but have evolved over the years to allow for a higher maximum bet.\nTraditionally, slot machines used mechanical reels and had about 22 symbols on each. This limited the number of possible combinations and the jackpots they could pay.\nBut modern slot machines use microprocessors and have multiple reels, which means they have a much larger number of possible combinations. In the past, these machines had a few hundred possible outcomes, but today they can have upwards of ten thousand.\nThe slot receiver is an extremely versatile position that requires a lot of different skills. They need to be able to run routes that can confuse the defense, and they need to be able to block. This is because they are positioned closer to the center of the field, where they will be more vulnerable to hits.\nThey are also a key part of a team’s blocking scheme, and they need to be able to protect their running back. They will often pick up blitzes from the linebackers and secondary players, but they are also very important on outside runs, where they give the running back more space to get free.\nUnlike other receivers, slot receivers need to be extra speedy and have excellent route-running skills.

{"id": "804", "text": "The rise of remote work has transformed the traditional workplace, with companies worldwide embracing the concept of a remote workforce. But what's in it for the employer?\n- Remote work has proven to be a game-changer for businesses looking to gain a competitive edge.\n- Remote work is a valuable tool for attracting and retaining top talent.\n- Research shows remote workers are 13% more productive than their office-based counterparts.\nIn this blog post, we'll dive into everything you need to know about how remote work benefits employers.\nFrom increased productivity and reduced overhead costs to expanded talent pools and better work-life balance for employees, remote work has proven to be a game-changer for businesses looking to gain a competitive edge.\nEverything You Need To Know About How Remote Work Benefits Employers\nWhile remote work was once considered a perk for employees, it has now become a necessity for many businesses in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n- The ability to work remotely has allowed companies to maintain their operations while keeping their employees safe and healthy.\n- In addition to being a critical business continuity strategy, remote work has also proven to be a valuable tool for attracting and retaining top talent.\nWith more employees seeking flexible work arrangements, offering remote work options can easily make your company stand out in a crowded job market.\nHow Remote Jobs Work\nRemote jobs are similar to traditional employment in many ways, with a few key differences:\n- Instead of working in a physical office, remote employees work from home, in a co-working space, or in any other location with a reliable internet connection.\n- Employers and employees will communicate via video calls, email, instant messaging, and other online collaboration tools.\nRemote work can be full-time or part-time, depending on the employer's needs and the employee's availability.\nIs Remote Work Effective?\nWhile remote work offers many benefits, one question that often arises is how effective it could be. After all, without the oversight of a traditional office environment, how can you ensure that your remote employees get their work done?\nFortunately, research shows that remote work can be just as effective, if not more so, than traditional office work. A study by Stanford University found that remote workers were 13% more productive than their office-based counterparts.\nRemote employees also tend to take fewer sick days and are more likely to work through minor illnesses, further increasing their productivity.\nAnother study by Buffer found that 90% of remote workers had a good experience working remotely. This increased satisfaction leads to:\n- Low turnover rates.\n- Reducing recruitment and training costs for employers.\n- Fewer chances of burnout.\nHowever, to be effective, remote work requires clear communication and collaboration between employees and employers, and managers must be equipped with the most robust strategies to manage remote teams.\nHow Remote Working Can Enhance Productivity of Your Employees\nRemote working can actually enhance the productivity of your employees in several ways. The primary benefit is that remote employees can often better focus on their work without the distractions of a traditional office environment.\nIn addition to this:\n- They also have more control over their work environment, which leads to increased comfort and productivity.\n- Remote work also eliminates the time and stress associated with commuting to and from work, allowing employees to use that time for more productive activities.\n- Also, the flexible work hours of remote work help employees better balance their work and personal lives.\nTo further enhance productivity, employers should provide their remote employees with the necessary tools and resources to succeed. This may include access to:\n- Collaboration and communication software.\n- Ergonomic workstations.\n- Home office budget.\n- And training on how to effectively manage their time and tasks.\nThese Are the 9 Ways How Remote Work Benefits Employers\nRemote work is all the rage these days. If you're an employer, consider embracing remote work, as it comes with a bunch of unique benefits that a traditional office setting lacks.\nFrom increased flexibility for employees to saving a lot on your compensation budget with location-indexed salaries, these are the 9 benefits of remote work for employers.\n1. Increased Flexibility\nAllowing employees to work from home can increase their flexibility and work-life balance, leading to:\n- Improved morale.\n- Job satisfaction.\n- And productivity.\nRemote workers can more easily balance their work with family responsibilities, personal interests, and other commitments without having to handle everything under pressure like it's some burden they have on themselves.\nAnd these benefits will only reflect in the overall performance of your company.\n2. Reduced Overhead Costs\nWorking remotely means nobody needs a physical space to operate from. So that eliminates the dependency on office rent, utilities, and supplies, helping you save on these overhead costs.\nHowever, there still may be some expense involved here. Some remote companies will still have a physical HQ in their home country, where employees could occasionally come in.\nSometimes it's not really necessary, but companies might choose to have a physical office space here and there just for the sake of it. But for some companies (although rare), having at least a physical HQ is necessary for their smooth operation.\n3. Access to a Larger Pool of Talent\nRemote work comes with the advantage of hiring remotely. That means the barrier to hiring beyond a certain geographical constraint is now opened up for you.\nYou can hire the best talent from anywhere in the world rather than being limited to a local pool of candidates. As a company engaged in remote work, you have the opportunity to hire talent residing beyond your city, state, or country.\nThis basically opens up opportunities to tap into a diverse range of skills and perspectives and can help you find the right fit for your company's needs.\n4. Improved Retention\nThe idea of working from anywhere appeals to a broad audience. Before the pandemic, it was a pipe dream for people with digital skills. But now, the opportunity to work remotely is a basic necessity that many companies offer.\nEven better, according to a recent survey, 61% of employees that participated in the study preferred fully remote work.\nSo if you offer your employees the opportunity to work remotely, they'll stick with you for a longer time solely to utilize the benefits of remote work.\n5. Reduced Absenteeism\nWhen employees miss work, it causes:\n- Disruptions to workflow, project delays, and ultimately affects the bottom line.\n- Extra work for other employees who have to cover for the absent worker.\n- A negative impact on workplace morale, as other employees may feel resentful toward those who are frequently absent.\nBut remote work reduces the chances for an employee to miss work. It mostly comes down to the fact that they have better flexibility, helping them manage their work and other responsibilities efficiently.\nAnd when employees work in close proximity to one another, illnesses can spread quickly throughout the office, leading to higher rates of absenteeism. So remote work helps with that as well.\n6. Enhanced Diversity and Inclusion\nRemote work helps to create a more diverse and inclusive workplace, as it allows you to tap into a wider pool of talent, including those with disabilities or other personal circumstances that may make it difficult for them to work in a traditional office setting.\nHaving people from different backgrounds and cultures contributing to your company will help you become more and more creative. It makes your company a hub of variety, bringing in a lot of positive energy compared to a local, bland setting.\n7. Increased Employee Engagement\nRemote work also increases employee engagement, as employees are given more autonomy and trust in their work and can focus on tasks without distractions.\nNow, some companies still micromanage their remote employees. Don't do that. There's nothing more discouraging at work for employees than having a manager peeking at their screen over their shoulder.\nMany remote managers aren't aware of the proper management process for remote work. So consider sitting down with your managers for a talk if you see them micromanaging.\n8. Improved Morale\nAs remote employees have the freedom to work when and where they choose, they often experience greater job satisfaction and a better work-life balance. This leads to a sense of:\n- Stress reduction.\n- And helps them prevent burnout.\nAlso, remote work allows employees to work in environments that are more conducive to their personal preferences and needs. Some employees may prefer to work in quiet, distraction-free environments, while others may thrive in busy and collaborative settings.\nAnd this autonomy results in improved morale among your remote employees.\n9. Savings on Compensation Budget With Location-indexed Salary\nRemote work gives you access to two types of compensation strategies: location-indexed salary and equal pay.\nLocation-indexed salaries are based on the idea that the cost of living and prevailing wages can vary significantly from one location to another.\nBy indexing employees' salaries to the cost of living in their location, you can attract and retain top talent from different countries. For example, if your company is based in a developed country like the US or UK, the minimum wage in your country would equal the top salary range of developing countries.\nSo you have the option to go cheaper while still being able to hire the best talent out there!\nDoes Remote Work Mean Work From Home?\nOne common misconception about remote work is that it always means working from home.\n- While working from home is certainly one option for remote workers, it's not the only one.\n- Whereas for employees working from home, their home is their only option to work from other than their office.\nRemote employees can work from any location with a reliable internet connection, including co-working spaces, coffee shops, or even while traveling.\nThe freedom to \"work from home\" is usually granted to employees as a flexible working option. That means for most employees working from home, that won't be their permanent work location, and they'll usually have to return to the office after some time (perhaps after a few days or weeks).\nRemote work, on the other hand, is an entire contract on its own. You have no location constraints here, and the remote worker has the freedom to work from anywhere that's physically possible as long as they are getting the work done as needed and on time.\nRemote work has become a popular trend in recent years, which is not surprising considering its benefits.\nRemote jobs are effective and can enhance the productivity of employees. Moreover, remote work offers employers a wide range of benefits, including reduced costs, access to a larger pool of talent, and increased employee retention, among others.\nIt is worth noting that remote work does not necessarily mean working from home, as it can also involve working from anywhere with an internet connection.\nWith many benefits on the table, you should consider embracing remote work as a viable option to help them achieve their organizational goals and stay competitive in today's fast-paced work environment.\nFollow us for more knowledge about remote work\nWe'll be publishing new articles every week, and new social media content every day.

{"id": "827", "text": "The truth is, even when you give it your best shot, weight loss might not happen in all the right places, leaving stubborn fat resistant to diet and exercise. This is where our Sacramento liposuction procedure can help.\nWhy Choose Liposuction?\nAccording to the American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (ASAPS), of the over 2 million surgical cosmetic medical procedures performed by plastic surgeons in the United States in 2007 alone, liposuction was number one. Liposuction – also known as suction-assisted lipectomy – is a body contouring procedure that permanently removes the localized fat that does not respond to a healthy lifestyle. With that said, it should not be considered a substitute for diet and exercise.\nDo you still have unwanted bulges even when you’re at your “skinny” weight? Many times it comes down to genetics. No matter how many miles you’ve put on the treadmill, no matter how many desserts you’ve skipped, you still cannot get rid of your problem areas.\nBut with liposuction, you can congratulate yourself knowing you’ve selected the most popular cosmetic procedure in the U.S. and one of the most requested right here in Sacramento – liposuction. This procedure can forever rid you of those hard-to-lose pockets of fat in your buttocks, thighs, abdomen, upper arms or back. Perhaps it’s a little “double chin” that’s bothering you. Whatever your concern is, our doctors can help.\nIf you’re considering liposuction, call 916-929-1833 to schedule a consultation today.\nPlanning For Your Liposuction Procedure\nLiposuction should not be mistaken for a weight-loss surgery. It is meant to reduce unwanted pockets of fat on the body that have been resistant to your diet and exercise efforts. The closer you are to your weight loss goal, the more effective liposuction tends to be at achieving attractive, trim contours.\nAhead of your surgery, you will have a consultation with one of Sacramento’s finest plastic surgeons. During this meeting, your surgeon provides a detailed explanation of what liposuction can realistically achieve for your unique body.\nYour surgeon at The Plastic Surgery Center in Sacramento can determine if you’re a good candidate. Other body sculpting procedures, such as a tummy tuck or body lift might be recommended as a better alternative to achieve your specific goals. Prior to any cosmetic surgery procedure, be sure to follow your plastic surgeon’s instructions on taking medications and vitamins, eating, drinking and stopping smoking.\nAreas Where Liposuction Is Effective\nLiposuction is a versatile surgery that can successfully treat most areas of the body where fat accumulates. These includes\n- Upper arms\n- Male breast tissue\nHow Fat Removal With Liposuction Is Performed\nDepending on its complexity, the procedure lasts anywhere from 30 minutes to several hours. You may receive general anesthesia or sedation with local anesthesia. The plastic surgeon makes a small incision so that a hollow tube, called a cannula, can be inserted. The cannula is attached to a vacuum machine, which is then manipulated deep within the fatty layers under the skin to break up the fat and suction it out. Fluids are infiltrated into the tissue prior to liposuction to improve and enhance the fat removal.\nThe treated area will be bandaged with a snug elastic dressing to control swelling and bleeding; it also helps your skin to shrink to fit your new, more slender contour. You may be heavier initially due to the swelling after surgery. The suctioned areas will be swollen and bruised, and you might feel some burning. Sometimes, the suctioned area will feel “funny” or a little numb for a while. Medication will be given to lessen any pain or discomfort. You should avoid strenuous activity for at least two weeks. If you have any bleeding or severe pain, be sure to call your doctor.\nAlthough you are likely to notice a somewhat trimmer figure immediately after your surgery, you should be patient in judging your results until they are final. It can take several months for the swelling and bruising to fully subside and reveal your new contours. Results from liposuction are considered indefinite. Fat cell removal is permanent, so you can maintain your contoured physique for as long as you maintain a steady weight moving forward.\nThe cost of liposuction varies from patient to patient, with the most important factors being the type of liposuction performed, the specific area(s) being treated and the total number of areas receiving contouring. During a consultation, your surgeon can devise a surgical plan that includes a thorough cost breakdown so you know what to expect. Since liposuction is an elective, cosmetic procedure, it is not covered by most health insurance plans. The Plastic Surgery Center does offer financing options if you would like to make payments toward the total cost of liposuction.\nWhat types of fat can liposuction effectively target?\nLiposuction is ideal for localized areas of fat that never seem to shrink and seem immune to traditional lifestyle approaches. For example, a person may exercise regularly and lose weight through a balanced diet and still retain excess fat in the hips or thighs.\nIn addition to the hips and thighs, patients commonly seek reductions in the abdomen, buttocks, arms, neck or back. Men may also choose liposuction as a way to treat gynecomastia, a condition characterized by an increased volume of fat in the chest area. Liposuction is sometimes used to treat jowls and cheeks, although The Plastic Surgery Center team may recommend alternative procedures for facial areas.\nSome types of fat cannot be removed by liposuction. In many obese individuals, the abdominal fat that produces the unwanted overhanging belly profile surrounds internal organs. Because it is located below the muscle, it is not safe to remove this type of fat.\nDoes liposuction treat cellulite or stretch marks?\nLiposuction is not a treatment for improving the appearance of skin. The elasticity of a patient’s skin is a key factor in how the skin will look after the procedure. If skin is elastic and muscle tone is good, the skin will conform well to the new body shape. With skin that has been stretched and is less elastic, folds of skin may be apparent after removal of fat.\nCellulite and stretch marks are also not likely to improve significantly, although there may be a slight smoothing of the area, depending on the firmness of your skin. A patient with realistic expectations will be pleased by the way the procedure can sculpt the body, restoring the attractive proportions of a fit and balanced profile.\nWill the fat return?\nIf you change the lifestyle behavior that led to obesity, you will not need to worry about those pockets of fat returning. The cells that were removed during liposuction are gone and will never grow back. But if your weight begins to rise again, adjoining fat cells will expand to store the excess caloric intake. Regular exercise and eating nutritious foods in limited quantities are the best ways to preserve your new shape.\nAre there less-invasive options?\nWhen it comes to removing stubborn pockets of fat, CoolSculpting is one highly effective alternative. This technique involves freezing cells in the flabby “pinchable” areas of body fat. These crystallized cells are then absorbed by the body over a period of weeks or months. The gradual reduction of fat in targeted areas allows your skin to progressively shrink to cover your new profile.\nHow much weight can liposuction help me lose?\nOur surgeons must stress that liposuction is not intended for weight loss. To lose weight, you should try diet and exercise, or perhaps bariatric surgery. Liposuction is a body contouring procedure that works best on patients who are within 10 pounds of their goal weight. You will see better results if you lose weight with a healthy lifestyle and then use liposuction to help improve the appearance of your trimmed down physique.\nHow is tumescent liposuction different from traditional liposuction?\nCompared to traditional liposuction, tumescent liposuction utilizes smaller incisions, milder anesthesia and a saline solution that helps to break up the fat tissue. In combination, these factors provide an easier recovery, fewer complication risks and highly effective body contouring. These days, our surgeons often recommend tumescent liposuction as the best approach for many of our patients.\nWill I have loose skin after liposuction?\nThe way your skin looks after liposuction depends on its current condition. Patients with younger, elastic-like skin should see their skin contract to fit the new contours achieved with liposuction. Those whose skin is not as supple may see their skin sag, unfortunately.\nYour surgeon can discuss what you can expect to see after liposuction, as well as additional treatments you may be interested in such as laser skin tightening procedures or a “lift” surgery like tummy tuck, thigh lift or arm lift that removes excess skin to rejuvenate a section of the body.\nCall 916-929-1833 now to learn more about medical spa services, facial rejuvenation and cosmetic surgery procedures for both men and women, such as liposuction. Sacramento plastic surgeons at The Skin Care Center and at The Plastic Surgery Center make enhancing the body, mind and spirit easy. With offices on Scripps Drive in Sacramento and in Granite Bay, looking and feeling your best with liposuction is convenient as well.\nBe sure to reserve your spot at a Free Seminar hosted by The Plastic Surgery Center and get expert insight into such subjects as tummy tucks and breast implants in Sacramento.

If you want to make your purchase through a Federal Firearms Licensee, either at a store or a gun show, you have to go through Pennsylvania’s Instant Check System, also referred to as PICS. PICS is a system that is run by the Pennsylvania State Police. Its purpose is to give instant background checks to gun suppliers on people who try to make gun purchases, so they can decide if a person is legally allowed to buy a gun. PICS is also used to determine if a person is eligible to obtain a concealed carry license.\nIf you are thinking about either buying a firearm or getting your concealed carry license, Pittsburgh criminal defense attorney Sean Logue and his team of experienced attorneys can help you get ready to fill out the application and evaluate your circumstances to identify anything that might be a problem for you.\nThe applications you must complete to purchase a firearm are the PA Form SP4-113 and the ATF Form 4473. The form you complete when you apply for a concealed carry license is PA Form SP4-127. These forms are all confusing and very complex. Even attorneys sometimes have trouble understanding the questions. However, a mistake on any of the three applications can lead you to be charged with a felony.\nSean Logue and his team have defended many people who thought they could outsmart PICS or who either didn’t understand their criminal record or the questions on the forms. If you give false information on one of those forms, you can be charged with a specific charge: a Misdemeanor 18 Pa.C.S Section 4904 Unsworn Falsification to Authorities, or a Felony 18 Pa.C.S. Section 6111 Unsworn Falsification to Authorities. You could also be charged with both.\nAny prior mental health issue, involvement in domestic violence of any form (including Protection From Abuse actions), drug abuse, or any kind of criminal record, you need to contact Logue Law Group before you try to fill out a firearm purchase application or concealed carry license application. Sean and his team can keep you from being their next criminal defense client.\nDon’t try to go completing these forms without assistance. Your freedom from additional criminal charges is too important to leave to chance. Let Sean Logue and his team of experienced Pittsburgh criminal defense attorneys assist you as you prepare to complete the complex and confusing state and federal gun ownership and carry applications. Sean and his team will do their best to get you prepared to purchase the firearm you desire.\nIf you are deemed by PICS to be ineligible to purchase a gun or concealed carry license, you will be given a challenge form by the dealer. You have 30 days to complete the form and appeal the decision. You will need to give PICS additional details to help them in their review. If you were denied because a conviction was expunged or otherwise disposed of, include that information. Also, you need to make sure you complete all the sections of the form. Failure to do so will cause your challenge to be automatically denied. There are four pages to complete. On the first page, parts one through three have to be filled in completely, and on page four, you have to sign and date the form. A Pittsburgh criminal defense attorney can help you with this.\nDo you plan on purchasing a firearm? Do you know someone who is? If so, you need a criminal defense attorney who knows and understands the laws around the possession of firearms to assist you.

{"id": "886", "text": "Liverpool confirmed the signing of Preston North End centre-back Ben Davies on deadline day, as Jurgen Klopp looks to remedy his defensive injury crisis.\nThe Reds tried out their 12th different centre-back pairing in the recent 3-1 win over West Ham on Sunday, with Jordan Henderson partnering Nat Phillips to see off the Hammers in the Premier League.\nAsked about the potential incoming of Davies at the London Stadium, Klopp remained tight-lipped but confessed his “eyes are always open”, before praising the defensive heroics of Phillips and Henderson.\nHe said: “Phillips played a decent game and Milly [James Milner] shouted at Hendo [Jordan Henderson] ‘you better be careful, if you play like this you’ll play there for the rest of his career’.”\nOn Sky Sports commentary for the West Ham encounter, Gary Neville also name-dropped Javier Mascherano when discussing Henderson’s recent defensive showings. The Argentine, formerly of Liverpool, famously made the transition from holding midfielder to ball-playing centre-back, and Henderson could follow a similar trajectory.\nBut the Reds required surefire reinforcements, with Virgil van Dijk, Joe Gomez and now Joel Matip long-term absentees, while Fabinho is also currently sidelined, which may explain the club’s late move for Preston’s Davies.\nThe deal for Davies saw unheralded teenager Sepp van den Berg go the other way on loan, doubling up as a very astute piece of business, while Schalke central defender Ozan Kabak also arrived.\nBut, what exactly can Liverpool fans expect from Davies?\n— Liverpool FC (@LFC) February 1, 2021\nStyle of play\nAt 6ft 1in, Davies is far from the most physically-imposing defender, but what he lacks in muscle mass he makes up for in other areas. The 25-year-old is a tidy left-footed centre-back and is renowned for his ability on the ball, as well as distribution, two essential attributes of a Liverpool defender.\nHe’s composed in possession and makes ball-carrying runs from deep, a move regularly exhibited by Liverpool defenders. But, perhaps more importantly, his long-range distribution is one of his stronger areas, which bodes well when you have players like Sadio Mane and Mohamed Salah making regular runs over the top.\nSince the start of last season, Davies has completed 268 long-passes, which places him in the Championship’s top five for that particular metric among centre-backs. When you consider Liverpool have completed the third-most long-passes in the Premier League this season (615), it appears Klopp has done his homework.\nThere may certainly be some scepticism that at 25, turning 26 in the summer, Davies is yet to make it out of the Championship, but one only has to look at Jamie Vardy, who didn’t make his Premier League introduction until his late 20s, as a perfect case study for reason to believe Davies can make the step up.\nAnd at a reported £2m it really can’t be considered a significant risk to the champions’ coffers. Klopp has got himself one of the Championship’s most impressive and consistent centre-backs across the past four years, a defender who fits the Liverpool ball-playing mould, someone who provides greater squad depth, and all while seeing Van den Berg gain valuable experience the other way.\nUnder sporting director Michael Edwards, Liverpool have proven assured and resourceful in the market since Klopp took the reins on Merseyside, and the Davies deal has the potential to be another Andrew Robertson-style signing, with the Scot joining from relegated Hull in 2017 for only £8m.", "scores": {"score": 0, "score_transform_1": 0, "score_transform_2": 0, "score_transform_3": 1}}

{"id": "931", "text": "The Marvel Cinematic Universe has (in)famously had a hard time establishing romantic relationships between its characters: even the few love stories that have helped to define the overarching story have sometimes gone through ups and downs, or simply collided headfirst with a brick wall and died (looking at you, Thor & Jane). And yet they keep trying to master the same old boy-meets-girl (or Norse-god-meets-girl, or boy-meets-alien, or computer-program-meets-girl) formula. That’s why, in celebration of Valentine’s Day, I’ve set myself a challenge: trying to find the ten most romantic, endearing, adorable couples in the MCU and ranking them.\nDisclaimer: “ships” or non-canon pairings aren’t being considered on this list because that would be cheating – most MCU “ships” are at least ten times better than the majority of actual onscreen pairings. It’s simply not fair to compare.\n10: Thor & Jane Foster.\nThese two had something that looked like potential – I mean, if you squinted really hard. From the moment that Thor, the Norse God of Thunder and rightful heir to the throne of Asgard, crash-landed in the American Southwest, upsetting one of Jane Foster’s pseudo-scientific experiments, Marvel tried to convince audiences that a grand and glorious epic love-story for the ages was brewing – but all the magic (or “what your ancestors call magic”) words in the Marvel mythos couldn’t force Chris Hemsworth and Natalie Portman to look more than remotely disinterested in each other. And after Thor: The Dark World failed to turn up the heat, or really do anything at all, Portman had finally had enough: she quit the MCU, and Jane Foster was subsequently written out of the story. In Thor: Ragnarok, it was briefly mentioned that she broke up with the Thunder God offscreen – an uncomfortably awkward conclusion to what was supposed to be a cornerstone of Thor’s entire arc.\n9: Stephen Strange & Christine Palmer.\nI’m actually tempted to move this couple ever so slightly further up the list, because while they’re not exactly memorable, they’re also probably not as bad and/or boring as you remembered. Dr. Stephen Strange, a snobbish, arrogant surgeon, wasn’t just the on-and-off boyfriend of Dr. Christine Palmer – he was also her work-partner, and it was mentioned (though never really elaborated on) that the two had even pioneered an important new surgical technique, making the couple basically equal. And after Strange’s run-in with karma, it was Palmer who tried to help him recover his strength and rebuild his life: their heated argument about Strange’s future is the most powerful scene in the Doctor Strange movie, and carries a lot of emotional weight. Unfortunately, Rachel McAdams’ character basically fades into the background after that, and apart from being privy to a battle on the astral plane and trying (unsuccessfully) to save the Ancient One’s life, she really has nothing more to do in the story. And she’s not returning for the sequel, so I guess that’s the end of that.\n8: Peter Quill & Gamora.\nI don’t really like either Peter Quill (a.k.a. Star-Lord, an interstellar pirate armed with braggadocio, semi-Celestial powers that have proved to be entirely inconsequential outside of his own movies, and an impressive playlist of golden oldies), or Gamora (a.k.a. The Most Dangerous Woman In The Galaxy, who never actually lived up to that title before her untimely death at the hands of\nmale screenwriters who didn’t know what else to do with her her own father, Thanos): nonetheless, I have to admit they had a spark of chemistry in both Guardians Of The Galaxy movies – and their interactions in Avengers: Infinity War, during which Gamora nearly convinced Quill to kill her (long story), are pretty emotional. There was something there! It wasn’t much, maybe, but it also wasn’t not there – much to the dismay of Thor & Peter Quill shippers everywhere. But in the end, Quill failed (because doesn’t he always?), Gamora got tossed off a cliff, and here we are with nothing left of their relationship but a sad trail of bubbles.\n7: Natasha Romanoff & Bruce Banner.\nI like Avengers: Age Of Ultron. I know it’s unpopular to say this, but it’s honestly the best Avengers movie – not only because it references the events of Agents Of S.H.I.E.L.D., but also because it successfully balances almost all of the main characters while still being able to add a couple new ones to the mix. There’s a cohesive plot, the stakes are raised, and the Avengers get to interact with each other on a more personal, intimate level than ever before. And then there’s Natasha Romanoff’s random relationship with Bruce Banner – while it’s not a bad idea, and they make a cute couple, the basis for their coupling up is based on the problematic idea that they’re both “monsters”: Bruce, because he transforms into a giant green killing machine; Natasha, because she’s…infertile? The messaging is weird and kind of sexist, especially since it would have been way easier to make Natasha’s murderous past with the KGB the reason for her guilt and self-loathing. It’s a shame, because Natasha actually did have better interactions with Bruce than she ever had with her former love interest, Clint Barton, but for better or worse their story arc was completely abandoned in Avengers: Infinity War.\n6: T’Challa & Nakia.\nWhile there’s certainly an argument to be made that T’Challa, the catsuit-wearing guardian of the African nation of Wakanda, is slightly more low-key and subdued than many of his co-stars in Black Panther (let’s face it, he doesn’t have Okoye’s fiery energy, Killmonger’s smoldering charisma, or M’Baku’s macabre humor), there can be no denying that his relationship with Wakandan secret agent/humanitarian Nakia is super cute. The two are a power couple, with both characters having genuine hero moments – Nakia even briefly diverts the main focus of the film away from T’Challa, and considers becoming the Black Panther herself. By the end of the film, she’s also working around the world to help extend Wakandan aid to those in need. And when they’re onscreen together, they’re presented as a healthy, sturdy relationship that doesn’t have to rely on drama, troubling gender dynamics, or sarcastic banter to be interesting. They’re basically #CoupleGoals, and I love them.\n5: Wanda Maximoff & The Vision.\nAh, the tragic story of the computer program who became a man…once, for no apparent reason, and never did so again. The Vision, a sentient computer program outfitted with a cool new body (that, unfortunately for him, came along with the Mind Stone, one of the most coveted objects in the galaxy), didn’t really show any signs of attraction to the troubled witch, Wanda Maximoff, until Captain America: Civil War, but when their romance finally kicked into gear, and the two began to bond over spicy food, things got good – and then immediately got weird again, when Wanda blasted Vision through a floor, before suddenly…ending up on the run with him in Scotland? Where Vision was suddenly able to turn into a human man, but only did so once, for reasons that were never explained? Yeah, so there’s some serious gaps in what we actually know about their relationship, but at least it ended on a strong note, with Wanda having to brutally murder her lover in an attempt to destroy the Mind Stone before Thanos could get to it, only to watch Thanos use the Time Stone to reverse all her hard work, murder Vision again, and use the Stones to wipe out half the galaxy, including Wanda herself. If it’s any consolation, the upcoming WandaVision series on Disney+ will feature Wanda resurrecting her dead partner, only to have him presumably die once again when her entire reality inevitably comes crashing down around her. Cheerful, am I right?\n4: Scott Lang & Hope Van Dyne.\nTechnically, there have been two canon MCU power couples that call themselves Ant-Man and The Wasp: Hope Van Dyne’s parents, Hank Pym and Janet Van Dyne, and then Hope herself and her partner, reformed burglar/single father/world’s best grandma, Scott Lang. But the latter couple has the edge on its predecessor, mostly because Janet doesn’t actually show up until the end of the second Ant-Man film, and most of her flashbacks with Hank were cut out of the movie anyway. Scott and Hope share the spotlight (and the title-card) in Ant-Man And The Wasp, which focuses almost entirely on their relationship – and their exchanges of playful, witty banter, coupled with their fidelity and focus on family, make them one of the most endearing couples in the MCU.\n3: Steve Rogers & Peggy Carter.\nSpecifically, their relationship in the first three Captain America films, before Avengers: Endgame happened. In the beginning, scrawny new recruit Steve Rogers and fast-talking, no-nonsense commanding officer Peggy Carter were actually quite a sweet pairing: they both had character arcs, and agency in their own stories. There was a quaint little 1940’s love story between them, but Peggy, by virtue of being in the military, wasn’t forced to play the damsel-in-distress or grieving-girlfriend-on-the-home-front roles: and in the post-war era, after Steve went down in the frigid Antarctic Ocean and was lost, she picked up her life and moved on, founding S.H.I.E.L.D. and starting a family. Her relationship with Steve after his resurrection from the ice was deeply emotional and interesting, and it was tragic when she passed away. But then to essentially reverse all the complexities of their post-The First Avenger relationship by having Steve go back in time and start all over with her, making her essentially a consolation prize for Steve after he failed to move on with his life, thus preventing her from moving on with hers? No, just no.\n2: Tony Stark & Virginia “Pepper” Potts.\nThey’re the MCU’s original duo: how could they not come in near the top of the list? Tony was a sarcastic, cynical mess of a human being; a war-profiteer who didn’t care one iota about the countless people killed daily by his weapons of mass destruction; Pepper was the very opposite, a cool, collected woman with savvy business skills and a friendly disposition. It’s a trope, and a tired one at that. But their relationship evolved into so much more than that – Tony became Iron Man, and Pepper took over as CEO of Stark Industries. They constructed the Avengers Tower in New York City. In the five years after Avengers: Infinity War, they got married and had a daughter. In Avengers: Endgame, where they even got to fight in battle alongside each other, their decade-long relationship came to an end with Tony Stark’s tragic death. In that final moment, as the former “Merchant of Death” gave up his life to save the world, Pepper stayed beside him and her face was the last thing he ever saw. I’m not crying: you’re crying.\n1: Leopold Fitz & Jemma Simmons.\nYes, I cheated! Fitz and Simmons, or “Fitzsimmons” as they’re more commonly known among the fandom, are not technically members of the MCU: they come from the Marvel TV division, where they made their debut on Agents Of S.H.I.E.L.D. and have endured through six grueling, torturous seasons of hardship, personal loss, tragedy and pure, wholesome romance. While they started out as the team’s two bumbling, socially-awkward scientists, it didn’t take long before the universe’s vendetta against them resulted in them standing up for S.H.I.E.L.D., and for each other, in incredible ways. Their tense, frantic struggle to figure their way out of an airtight box at the bottom of the ocean (long story) was one of the highlights of Season 1, as it showed just how powerful the two are as a team – so of course they were then split up. Jemma became an undercover spy, got eaten by a space monolith, was transported to another planet and had to survive on her own, fell in love with an astronaut who turned into an evil alien god, was possessed by the Kree, was possibly hinted to be bisexual (come on, we all know she had a thing for Daisy), and even met and defeated the demonic personification of her self-doubt: Leo lost his ability to communicate for a long period of time and became delusional, was possibly hinted to be bisexual (come on, we all know he had a thing for Mac), became a dashing secret agent, met his evil HYDRA doppelganger, fell in love with HYDRA’s cyborg overlord, and then got stuck in two different time-periods at once, which resulted in him dying but still being alive and yet somehow a space pirate in both timelines…it’s a wacky and confusing series, but their love for each other, which persists even against all odds, has always been at the heart of the story, and I would be lying if I didn’t say they’re the most romantic couple in what used to technically be part of (or at least adjacent to) the MCU.\nSo what do you think of my top ten, and would you have chosen differently?

Breeders, veterinarians, and trainers provide expert answers in the world's 1st dog-site.\nDog Activities To Alleviate Boredom\nby Karen Rhodes, Family Dog Consultant\nHave you ever come home to total chaos created by your beloved house dog? Does your dog display behavior issues such as chewing on objects or himself?\nDo you hear a heavy sigh from your pooch when you want to relax from the work-a-day grind and your dog wants to play? Barring any health concerns, does your dog show lack of ambition, or ever look forlorn and lost?\nAll of this is common for dog owners who do not involve their dogs in physical and mental activities. Dogs get bored. Dogs were meant to hunt, to trot for miles, to exert tremendous energy chasing and catching prey. Being intelligent creatures, dogs will either look for non-boring activities or turn inward, becoming disinterested in life in general.\nDogs are social animals; historically pack animals. Now with extreme domestication, dogs rely on their humans to be their “everything”. We are their buddies, teachers, friends, companions, exercise partners, providers, health care workers, etc. Prematurely separated from their dam and littermates, it is we who must teach puppies to be better companions. But they also educate us because by tuning into your dog you can be a better owner and have a happier, better behaved animal.\nCertain breed behaviors may not be suitable to your lifestyle. Look up the Breed Standards and learn whether they are active, laid-back or protective. Pay attention to these when selecting a dog. If you acquire a mixed breed be prepared to learn on the fly because its behavior, personality, and activity requirements are less predictable. If possible visit the prospective adoptee several times, noting whether the demeanor and personality will fit your style and needs.\nIf considering a purebred dog, use your experience and information readily available to pair with the right pooch and you both will prosper in your relationship.\nCertain instincts and behaviors have been ingrained into a pure-breed dog and are described in the AKC Breed Standard. They can be generalized into a breed characteristic or standard. General knowledge of breed type and activity level can help you with your choice. Dog breeds are not categorized haphazardly, retrievers generally retrieve, herding breeds herd; “working dogs” work and so on. Some dogs are quite content with a couch potato lifestyle; others live for physical challenges, mental stimulation and excitement.\nDon’t let trends or a popular television show influence your breed choice. There is some bad information out there, many playing on your heartstrings instead of your logical mind as to selecting a dog you are compatible with. If dog breeders and dog professionals say a breed tends to be; “stubborn”, “needy”, “not recommended for first time owners”, “are not to be off leash”, “very physical”, this information is probably true.\nAge and physical characteristics of dog has a huge impact on ability and physical stamina so it is up to you to adapt an activity to the age and ability of the type dog. Remembering we are also responsible for their safety. For example, some breeds of dogs are recommended to have a fenced in area or be on leash whenever they are outside. I purchased a beagle pup years ago, she was a gorgeous dog and was very family friendly. I lived in a very rural area in the woods. My son and I trained this beautiful little girl, but Jewel would run every trail her nose came upon. I would often have to go searching for her because and trailing/tracking instincts were so strong nothing would get her to return to us upon command.\nWe ended up re-homing her to a wonderful man who enjoys hunting with dogs. His experience with beagles paid off and she became not only his most prized hunting canine but his life-long companion.\nBefore deciding on a breed or type of dog, think about your lifestyle and dog-friendly things you enjoy. We like to participate in; shows, visit dog parks, go for rides in the car, we hike, we go for swims, an occasional trip to the grooming parlor. I enjoy inventing new dog-games, compete in agility games, visiting individuals who are “shut ins, therapy work, obedience trials, camping trips. Don’t let physical limitations of the dog, your friends, or your own limit challenges or limit your imagination. Get creative; explore options and alternatives. Companionship is beneficial to both you and your dog.\nSeasons can affect the type of activities you and your dog can participate in. Extreme weather can be most annoying when your dog is displaying “cabin fever” wanting to get outside to play. Indoor play, car rides and other forms of entertainment can break the monotony. Using common object such as cardboard boxes, toilet paper tubes, marrow bones, toys (both bought and created) keep even my youngest dog satisfied when the weather is not so accommodating.\nA few minutes to a few hours of spending “quality time” with your dog can be a blessing for you both. Dog activities based on physical exercise and mental stimulation helps both dog and owner health and emotional well-being. It can have your dog looking forward to your next adventure instead of becoming bored engaging in maladaptive behaviors or becoming personality stagnant, overweight, unhappy or seriously depressed.\nI consider my dogs family and we love our adventures and outings. When ‘out and about’ we follow pet rules of hygiene, practice courtesy, soak up sunshine, give and receive blessings, and our lives are better for these dog-related activities.\nTheDogPlace.org EST 1998 © Apr. 20192207 https://www.thedogplace.org/Training/dog-activities-to-alleviate-boredom-k19R05.asp\nBrought to you by the NetPlaces Network\nThe world’s 1st public website TheDogPlace.org from Animal Health to Vaccines.\nThe world's 1st online dog news, TheDogPress.com from AKC records to zoological news.\nThe world's 1st site by/for dog show judges TheJudgesPlace.com educates on purebred dogs.", "scores": {"score": 3, "score_transform_1": 5, "score_transform_2": 5, "score_transform_3": 0}}

{"id": "1001", "text": "Critique of AHRQ REPORT \"Meditation Practices for Health: State of the Research\"\nBackground: “The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) is the lead Federal agency charged with improving the quality, safety, efficiency, and effectiveness of health care for all Americans. As one of 12 agencies within the Department of Health and Human Services. AHRQ supports health services research that will improve the quality of health care and promote evidence-based decision making.” http://www.ahrq.gov/about/ataglance.htm\nIn 2007 the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCAAM) requested and funded a review and evaluation of research on the health benefits of meditation by the AHRQ, which was conducted at the University of Alberta Evidence-based Practice Center. The review covered the Transcendental Meditation technique and other techniques under the rubrics of Mantra meditation, Mindfulness meditation, Yoga, Tai Chi, and Qi Gong.\nSerious Problems. Serious problems with the report were found by experts in the field who were invited to participate in the study process as peer reviewers. These problems were largely ignored by both the study authors and the study's sponsors at AHRQ and NCCAM. Reviewers independently found the study had so many methodological flaws and mistakes that they recommended the report be withdrawn until it was corrected. Standard peer review, fact checking, and editors are usually effective at correcting misinformation. Unfortunately, these safeguards were not honored in this report, and misinformation is now positioned to guide public policy on the use of meditation techniques for healthcare.\nThe peer reviewers pointed out that the study's assessment of research quality was invalid because the study used inappropriate criteria for assessing research quality in the field of behavioral research. It did not heed the advice of reviewers and consultants to use correct criteria. It also omitted research in several important health areas such as tobacco and alcohol use, adolescents at risk for heart disease, and mortality. Moreover, it left out almost 100 studies from its review, although these had been provided to the reviewers in advance.\nConclusion of the Report. The report concluded that meditation research was of poor quality, not that meditation does not work, as was the interpretation given by much press coverage. The paper on the AHRQ report published in the Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine concluded: “Most clinical trials on meditation practices are generally characterized by poor methodological quality with significant threats to validity in every major quality domain assessed. Despite a statistically significant improvement in the methodological quality over time, it is imperative that future trials on meditation be rigorous in design, execution, analysis, and reporting of the results” (Ospina, et al., 2008).\nCritique of the Report. The editors of the Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine invited me to review and to write a commentary on the AHRQ report (Orme-Johnson, 2008). Here are the main points of my commentary.\nI. Wrong Criteria of Meditation Research Quality Were Used. The AHRQ used a wrong standard for assessing research quality. The standard they used was double blinding, which means that neither the person learning the technique nor the teacher of the technique know which technique the subject is given. Double blinding is appropriate for drug studies, in which the identity of the drug or the placebo are easily disguised (the pills look identical). But it is impossible for the teachers of the Transcendental Meditation technique, Yoga, Tai Chi, or Qi Gong, etc. not to know what they are teaching and in most cases is it not possible for the student not to know.\nII. Correct Criteria of Meditation Resarch Quality Were Not Used. The AHRQ report did not use any of the correct standards for assessing meditation research. The purpose of double blinding, as used in drug research, is to control for things like expectation, social influence, and bias. There are other ways besides double blinding that control for these factors and the AHRQ report did not score for any of them. Below is a list of factors that need to be controlled in behavioral research in general and in meditation research specifically, with examples of how the research on the Transcendental Meditation technique has controlled for them.\nControls for non-specific therapeutic attention—treatment and control groups should be made equivalent on:\n- Contact time with the teacher; there are TM studies in which the control subjects and TM subjects get the same amount of time with the teachers. Example of controls are health education classes or progressive muscle relaxation (PMR) used in blood pressure studies.\n- Teaching environments; TM studies have made sure that controls are taught in the same environments as TM.\n- Schedules of teaching and follow-up; many TM studies have matched the schedules of controls to the TM schedule.\n- Schedule and duration of practice of the treatment and control procedures; controls are given the same schedule of home practice as the TM program, such as 20 minutes twice a day of progressive muscle relaxation.\n- Blinding of data collection personnel and the attending physicians (this also controls detection bias, below). In many TM studies the personnel collecting the data, such as measuring blood pressure, and the doctors attending the patients do not know which group the subjects are in.\nControls for expectation--treatment and control groups should be made equivalent on:\n- Scientific evidence for effectiveness in treating the condition under study; in many TM studies there is a body of real evidence that the control condition is an effective treatment for the condition being studied, like diet and exercise or PMR for reducing blood pressure.\n- Qualified teachers; TM studies have used teachers who are highly qualified and committed to their treatment (E.G., trained teachers of diet and exercise programs or PMR)\n- Use of equivalent payment of fees, which may be no fees, or equivalent reimbursement for all subjects. In grant-funded TM studies all subjects in all groups are reimbursed equally for their participation.\nControls for detection bias:\n- Blinding of data collection personnel and of the attending physicians as which group the subjects are in.\n- Open collaboration with researchers at universities and medical facilities independent of any organization associated with teaching the meditation technique. This has been done in most of the research on TM and health in the last couple of decades.\nIII. In the AHRQ Report Well-Designed Studies Were Not Properly Identified. The AHRQ report did not distinguish between meditation studies which used proper behavioral controls from those that did not. The National Institutes of Health research grant are highly competitive (only about 20% are funded), and they are peer reviewed by the leading scientists in the nation in the areas of specialization of the grant application. The National Institutes of Health have awarded over $24 million in funds for research on the Transcendental Meditation technique, indicating that these studies have been well designed. http://www.doctorsontm.com/national-institutes-of-health Moreover, the TM research has been published in peer-reviewed professional journals in the field.\nIV. The AHRQ report did not score on many other factors that are necessary for good meditation research. These include the use of qualified teachers, compliance of the subjects with the meditation schedule, checks that the meditators are doing the practice correctly, and use of valid measurement methods (e.g., measure blood pressure several times, not just once, to get a reliable measure).\nV. A study could get a perfect score by the AHRQ report criteria, and if it failed on any one of these factors, the study would be totally invalid. For example, if the teachers were unqualified or the subjects did not learn the technique properly, or if they did not practice it regularly, then the study would be invalid, yet it could have a perfect score by the AHRQ report criteria.\nVI. The AHRQ report did not use a proper peer view process. The essence of science is check and balances of the scientific process by feedback from other experts in the field. The AHRQ report did employ experts, and some of them pointed out many of the limitations outlined above, yet the AHRQ study authors ignored this feedback, which is a serious breach of the scientific process. When a reviewer (Dr. Ken Walton) inquired how the AHRQ resolved questions raised by the reviewers, they merely replied that they had their own policies and procedures. It would have increased the transparency of the report to know what AHRQ policies and procedures were used to resolve issues raised by reviewers, and what the justification was for not adhering to standard peer-review practices.\nVII. The AHRQ report excluded studies on the effects of meditation techniques on tobacco, alcohol, and substance use, which are highly relevant for health. There are 19 on the TM technique (Alexander et al., 1994).\nVIII. The AHRQ report excluded studies the effects of meditation on adolescents, notably on those at risk for heart disease, a highly important area for prevention.\nIX. The AHRQ excluded well-controlled studies on mortality, the life extending effects of meditation, the bottom line of good health.\nX. The AHRQ report excluded 98 research papers on meditation, including all of Collected Papers, volume 5, even though these papers were made available to the reviewers.\nXI. The AHRQ report confounds meditation effects with exercise effects. It compared techniques in which the person sits down with eyes closed and does a mental technique, like the Transcendental Meditation technique and Mindfulness meditation with techniques that have a prominent exercise component, like Tai Chi, and Qi Gong.\nXII. Subsequent Meta-analyses, which have corrected for deficiencies in the AHRQ report, have found that the TM technique is effective in reducing blood pressure. A meta-analysis of nine randomized controlled trials found the TM program lowered blood pressure on average by –4.7/–3.2 mm Hg compared with controls (Anderson, Liu, & Kryscio, 2008). Subjects ranged in age from adolescents to seniors, and included normotensive, pre-hypertensive and hypertensive subjects. Subgroup analyses of four hypertensive groups and three high-quality studies showed similar reductions.\nAnother meta-analysis of the effects of stress reduction programs on hypertension patients evaluated high-quality studies that used active controls, adequate baseline measurement, and blinded BP assessment. Meta-analysis was used to calculate BP changes. The results for blood pressure decreases with biofeedback, relaxation-assisted biofeedback, progressive muscle relaxation, and stress management training, were not statistically significant. However, the TM program was significant, –5.0/–2.8 mm Hg (Rainforth et al., 2007).\nAlexander CN, Robinson P, Rainforth MV.

She said that their report does not support the conclusion that meditation doesn't improve health, nor does it say that 'there's no evidence that meditation eases health problems.' She said they were careful to point out that some meditation practices do show apparent benefits, such as lowering blood pressure and reducing stress.\nREVIEWERS FIND THE REPORT IS METHODOLOGICALLY FLAWED, INCOMPLETE, AND RECOMMEND THAT IT BE RETRACTED\nThe reviewers who found major flaws in the study were:\n- Dr. Harald Walach, Professor of Psychology of the University of Northampton and School of Social Sciences and the Samueli Institute for Information Biology in England, Editor in Chief of Spirituality and Health International, Editor in Chief, Forschende Komplementärmedizin/ Research in Complementary Medicine, member of the \"Peer-Review Board\" of the study;\n- Dr. Kenneth G. Walton, Research Associate Professor, Institute for Natural Medicine and Prevention, Maharishi University of Management, Fairfield Iowa, member of the \"Peer-Review Board\" of the study;\n- Dr. Vernon Barnes, Assistant Professor, Georgia Institute for Prevention of Human Diseases and Accidents, Department of Pediatrics, Medical College of Georgia, Augusta Georgia, member of the \"Technical Expert Panel\" of the study.\nClick here for full text of Professor Walach's review.\nClick here for Dr. Walton's review (PDF)\n(For press release from these and other top researchers, see: Top Researchers Criticize New Meditation and Health Study as \"Flawed, Incomplete, and Incorrect\")\nSome additional points from the reviewers not covered above.\nInadequate reporting. Reviewers of this report on meditation found that the authors of the study did not adequately describe the underlying assumptions and computational methods of the statistical analyses used, so that it was not possible to tell exactly how the report arrived at its results and conclusion.\nTranscribing errors. Reviewers found basic errors in transcribing data, and some studies were counted twice.\nClassification errors. Other studies were misclassified. For example, studies on pre-hypertensive subjects were included in the section on hypertension, a study was classified as Zen Buddhist meditation when in fact is was mainly progressive relaxation, and another study was classified as Transcendental Meditation when it was a newly invented meditation.\nMixed up of single and complex treatments. The report also has a fundamental problem in trying to compare single treatment meditation programs with complex or composite treatment programs, especially those that include a predominant exercise modality (which has by itself been shown to reduce BP, for example).\nMethodological scoring errors. Moreover, reviewers found that another important aspect of research design—the method of random allocation of subjects to treatment—was incorrectly scored in some instances. Thus, some of the results and conclusions of the report were simply based on mistaken data entry.\nDifferent results and conclusions when errors were corrected. Rainforth, Schneider, et al. (2007) found that in the case of the effects of meditation techniques on blood pressure, correcting the data entry mistakes in the report and redoing the meta-analysis resulted in different conclusions. The Transcendental Meditation technique was found to have a number of well-designed studies, more than other meditation techniques. It was found to produce clinically meaningful reductions in blood pressure, a mean reduction of -4.6 mm Hg systolic and -2.6 mm Hg diastolic, which is comparable with previously reported effects of aerobic exercise. Other stress-reduction treatments were not found to have clinically meaningful effects.\nInappropriate assessment of research quality. The reviewers also pointed out that the Jadad scale used to judge research quality was completely inappropriate for meditation research, because it weighs heavily on concealing from the subjects the identity of the meditation or control technique to which they were assigned. Such \"double blinding\" is appropriate for pharmaceutical trials, in which the identity of the pills are easily disguised, but in meditation research such practices are deceptive, unethical, and very difficult, if not impossible, to achieve. Moreover, they are counterproductive to the therapeutic relationship.\nImportant dimensions of research ignored. The Jadad scale is very narrow and does not measure many key elements of research validity, such as whether the meditation program was properly implemented, whether the techniques given were appropriate for treating the health condition under study, whether subjects were given the correct schedule (\"dose\") of meditation, or even such a basic things as level of compliance or whether the subjects even practiced the techniques at all. Using the Jadad scale, a study could be rated as having a high level of methodologic quality, when in fact the meditation technique might not be taught properly, or the subjects might not even practice it. The Jadad scale could have rated such a study as being of high quality, but in fact the information from it would have been completely useless.\nNo rating of whether the results generalized to other situations. The Jadad scale does not reflect \"external validity.\" External validity refers to whether the technique works under different conditions—such as different patient populations, age groups, or settings. For example, the Transcendental Meditation technique has been found to effectively reduce blood pressure in different age groups (adolescents at risk for hypertension, hypertensive adults, and the elderly), in patients in different categories of risk factors (e.g., patients at different levels of psychosocial stress, obesity, alcohol use, physical inactivity, and sodium use), in different ethnic groups (e.g., African American and Caucasian), and in different nationalities (e.g., US, India, and New Zealand). The report did not take any of this kind of information into account.\nNo rating of objectivity of the measures. The Jadad scale also does not credit the studies for using non-fakeable, objective measures, as opposed to highly subjective measures, such as most psychological tests.\nNo triangulation of the data. Nor does the Jadad scale reflect cross-validation by triangulating from different domains of measurement. For example, the assertion that meditation techniques can reduce anxiety would be greatly strengthened if it could be demonstrated that they reduce psychological, biochemical, and physiological, as well as behavioral/social indications of anxiety. A case in point is the Transcendental Meditation technique, which has been found to reduce anxiety as measured by psychometric tests, to decrease biochemical correlates of anxiety, such as blood lactate levels and adrenaline metabolites, to reduce autonomic markers of anxiety, such as basal and spontaneous skin conductance, to reduce behavioral/pharmacological indicators of anxiety, such as reduced use of tranquilizers and sedatives, and to reduce systolic blood pressure reactivity to social stressors (an interview about a stressful event). Triangulation of different domains of data was not taken into account by the review.\nKey studies omitted. Perhaps most significantly, apparently due to unnecessary constraints in the selection process, the report left out some of the most well-designed and important research in the field. In addition, many papers that met the authors' criteria for inclusion were omitted. These included two studies published in the American Journal of Cardiology in 2005, which demonstrated that individuals with high blood pressure who were randomly assigned to Transcendental Meditation groups had a 30% lower risk for mortality than controls.\nThe entire Volume 5 of Scientific Research on Maharishi’s Transcendental Meditation and TM-Sidhi Program (1990), which reprinted 75 important papers, was excluded, even though it was sent to the study authors to include in their review. Other studies which met the inclusion criteria, but which were incorrectly excluded, include nine studies on substance abuse, and numerous studies on the physiological effects of the Transcendental Meditation technique, including effects on cardiovascular functioning, pulmonary functioning, skin resistance/conductance, blood gas measurements, adrenocortical functioning, lipoprotein levels, EMG, carbohydrate metabolism, brain electrophysiological (EEG, EP. CNV), and numerous papers on cognitive/neuropsychological effects of meditation (1)attention, 2) memory, 3) perception, 4) other cognitive measures such as cognitive functioning, 5) reasoning, 6) sensorimotor functioning, 7) language, 8) creativity, 9) intelligence, and 10) spatial abilities). The report also incorrectly excluded dozens of studies on the effects of meditation on affective outcomes and mental health, such as depression, anxiety, and major meta-analyses on these outcomes (see Walton review for details).\nStudies on children omitted. Reviewers also questioned the wisdom of the report sponsors' decision to include only research on adults over 18 years of age. Excluding research on children is not only a violation of NIH policy*, it goes against the national interest in early detection and prevention of health problems through behavioral interventions. If teaching children and teenagers to practice a meditation technique could prevent such problems as cardiovascular disease, drug abuse, and academic failure, that would be an ideal solution. Good research exists in these areas. For example, randomized controlled studies and other research designs have shown that the Transcendental Meditation technique reduces blood pressure and cardiovascular reactivity to stressors in pre-hypertensive high school students, and reduces drug, tobacco, and alcohol use, and increases field independence, intelligence, and creativity in adolescents.\n*According to the NIH (NIH policy and guidelines on the inclusion of children as participants in research involving human subjects, March 6, 1998) \"It is the policy of NIH that children (i.e., individuals under the age of 21) must be included in all human subjects research conducted or supported by the NIH, unless there are scientific and ethical reasons not to include them.... This policy applies to all NIH conducted or supported research involving human subjects....\"\nNo constructive criticism. The report concludes that meditation studies are mostly of low quality yet provides little constructive guidance regarding what constitutes good methodology in the field of meditation research. It is disappointing that after a very extensive review of the meditation literature that the report only focuses on the problems in the field, only applies standards developed for pharmaceutical trials which it acknowledges are inappropriate for meditation research, and does not instead highlight progress that has been made in attempting to address the particular challenges of meditation research, such as studies that provide models of how to control for subject expectancy and attention from trainers. On the plus side, the finding that these \"meditation techniques,\" or perhaps more accurately, \"psychophysiological techniques,\" are each distinct in many ways from the other, with few or no characteristics that occur universally across the techniques, is a significant contribution and could be given greater emphasis.\nTHE SIGNIFICANCE OF PEER REVIEW:\nEXCERPT OF LETTER FROM REVIEWER DR. KEN WALTON TO THE STUDY AUTHORS, JULY 15, 2007\n\"If either of you has ever applied for a competitive grant from the U.S. National Institutes of Health, you know the serious meaning of peer review. Our peers who review and score these grant applications, and thus are the main determinant of the awards in a field where the odds run from about one in four to as low as about one in ten, go over every part of the 100 pages or more of the minutely detailed application. These peers are experts in their fields and are intimately familiar with what \"high quality research\" means. Many of them have been in their fields for over 30 years, and are finely attuned to all the nuances of research quality. Likewise, the journals in which our best publications from these grant-supported studies have appeared are specialty journals, like Hypertension, in which the peer reviewers again are highly experienced in their fields. The studies published in these journals are reviewed as thoroughly by the top experts as are the grant applications that secured the funding in the first place. Obviously, not every study on the Transcendental Meditation technique is funded through this mechanism and not every one is published in the top specialty journals. This is one reason for the considerable range of research quality among the published papers on this technique of meditation and perhaps on other techniques as well. The point I make here, however, is that for you to make the strong claims you have made concerning poor research quality of the majority of studies and not to also point out that some of the papers are of the highest quality available and that these highest quality studies tend to show significant benefits of the technique is not a position that can be justified by your systematic approach. It is an injustice to lump the outcomes from high quality papers with those from low quality papers in any overall comparison or in any overall statement such as the ones you have used in your summary.\nLETTER TO AHRQ, NCCAM, AND THE STUDY AUTHORS:\nEXCERPTS FROM REVIEWERS DR. KG WALTON, DR. H. WALACH, AND DR. V. BARNES, V. (JULY 17, 2007)\n\"The purpose of this letter is to bring attention to problems and failures that render many of the report's conclusions questionable or overtly incorrect and to offer suggested remedies. Two of us (Walton and Barnes) are long-time acquaintances who discussed some of these points during the reviewing process. Dr. Walach is a recent acquaintance with whom Walton and Barnes have communicated only after the report was published. Because the three of us identified similar issues that were dealt with inadequately or not at all in the final report, we now feel obliged to address the report's sponsoring institutions and authors to ask for appropriate corrections.\n\"In the Preface to the report on page iii, AHRQ details its expectation that their \"evidence reports and technology assessments will inform individual health plans, providers, and purchasers as well as the healthcare system as a whole by providing important information to help improve healthcare quality.\" The criticisms and solutions detailed in this letter are intended to help AHRQ realize these goals not only for this specific report but for future reports.\n\"The first and most central problem encountered, which may well be common to other AHRQ reports, is the spurious claim that the report was \"peer reviewed.\" The absence of a normal peer review is probably the most obvious source of erroneous information in this report. And it was accomplished in a manner inappropriate to scientific discourse. The initial reference to peer review occurs at the end of the second paragraph of the Preface, on page iii of the front matter. In fact, the members of both the \"review board\" and the \"technical expert panel\" were led to believe, when being invited to participate, that the errors they found in their review of the draft report would be addressed in the standard manner of peer reviews, namely, that their comments and suggestions would be responded to by the authors in a document that the reviewers could either sign off on, or contest and work out to mutual satisfaction, prior to the final report. This is the norm in peer reviewed scientific articles, and it is a crucial step in carrying out good science. In actuality, however, the only opportunity to evaluate the degree to which our critiques were addressed was to examine the final report after it was published. As a result, many errors noted by the three of us, and presumably additional errors found by the other 15 members of the review and technical expert panels, were not corrected in the final report....\n\"First is the evaluation of methodological strength. Each of us objected in our reviews to the use of scores on the Jadad scale as the main measure of methodological strength of randomized controlled trials (RCTs). This scale is particularly unsuited for the evaluation of behavioral approaches such as meditation techniques and psychotherapy, where blinding of the subjects to the identity of the treatment they are receiving, if at all possible, is certainly unethical and is likely to interfere with treatment effectiveness. The Jadad scale is narrow, asking 5 questions relevant to internal validity and no questions pertinent to external validity. Some consensus exists, both within the behavioral medicine field and in the clinical trials literature, that the Jadad scale is inadequate even for the evaluation of internal validity....\n\"Thus, in both the choice of approach for evaluating methodological strength and in the application of the chosen, weak approach, the report is so seriously flawed that its conclusions could be diametrically opposed to the truth....\n\"Flaws also were serious in the actual performance of the quantitative meta-analysis of this case (the effect of Transcendental Meditation technique versus health education on blood pressure). For example, each of us detected that the 5 RCTs in the analysis were not all appropriate for inclusion.\n\"However, not only did the report's authors fail to contact the lead authors of the studies, they also failed to correct this overlap problem after each of us had included this information in our reviews.... Furthermore, if another error noted by the reviewers, namely, the use of incorrect means and standard deviations in one line of data shown in Figures 3 and 4, had been corrected by the authors as the reviewers asked, that alone would have changed the outcome of the analysis.\n\"This one example, therefore, contains several problems serious enough to produce erroneous results for both the evaluation of methodological quality and the quantitative evaluation of effects of the treatment.

{"id": "1073", "text": "Spain is one of the most popular destinations for teaching English in Europe, and it’s not hard to see why. There’s a lot more to it than the stereotypes of siestas, bullfights, and sangria.\nThe Mediterranean lifestyle is a big draw, offering a comfortable work-life balance for TEFL teachers. Think delicious food, fine wines, and lots of time to socialize with friends in little tapas bars full of character or sipping a caña in a town square.\nGeographically, Spain is a very diverse country too. It’s not just the sun, sea, and sand of the Mediterranean that you see on the TV, there are beautiful green hills that stretch out endlessly in the Northern provinces of Galicia and Asturias, miles of desert like Paramo in the Castilla y Léon, and dramatic snow-capped mountain ranges which are perfect for those with an adventurous spirit. There’s a location in Spain to suit every type of teaching personality.\nSpain is a great location for first time teachers too – it has an excellent health care system (some schools may even offer private healthcare as part of your salary), it’s safe, and it’s one of Western Europe’s most affordable companies, meaning that you can enjoy your time off without worrying too much about your bank balance.\nThis useful guide will help you with everything you need to know about teaching in Spain!\nWhat type of jobs can I get in Spain?\nTeaching situations will vary depending on the type of school you choose to work in. In a regular government-run school, you’ll be sticking to the Spanish school curriculum, whereas in a private school or an academia, you may be supplementing your students’ knowledge of that curriculum, or working on one that the school has developed.\nAs a private tutor, you will be based in your home, or travelling to other people’s, whilst working with materials you’ve developed, or helping consolidate what your students’ already know.\nYou may teach adults or mature students in a private school, or as a private tutor. Find out more below!\nType of teaching jobs\nLanguage assistant in a mainstream school\nA job often applied to through a program such as the British Council or the Spanish Ministry of Education, this job is a good starting experience for those who want to be teachers in the future. You’ll be given a mentor who will help you plan lessons, which you will be responsible for delivering.\nHours are usually lower than in a full-time teaching role, meaning that you can take on private classes to supplement your income, or have more time to travel, as many schools try to give language assistants long weekends.\nYou’ll be surrounded by Spanish colleagues, which is a great way to improve your Spanish and start building your social life!\nTeacher in a private school/academia\nA popular choice for teachers in Spain, this is the next step up from a language assistant and you have a lot more responsibility. You’ll be expected to plan your own lessons according to your schools’ curriculum. The best private schools and academies always support their teachers and give them tips on managing classroom discipline and effective teaching methods so don’t worry if you don’t have loads of experience!\nPay is generally higher than language assistant programs, and you should expect to work for 20 – 25 hours per week plus planning time.\nMany private schools offer support and exam preparation for students in English, so classes take place on evenings and weekends rather than during the typical school day.\nIt doesn’t offer as much free time as an assistant-ship, but the responsibility of having your own classes more than makes up for it.\nIf you’re a native speaker, private classes are a great way to supplement your income from either of the above jobs, or if you have a big enough client base, to take it alone and manage your own schedule.\nYou can charge between €15 – €25 an hour, depending on your location.\nLook at what other people charge on websites like www.tusclasesparticulares.com and signs on noticeboards around your town to see what the going rate is.\nHow to find a teaching job\nAlthough it’s not always necessary to be a native English speaker, teaching in Spain is competitive so it certainly helps!\nMost schools hire for the academic year, between September and June/July. It is best to start looking from March or April onwards online. Vacancies often come up around Christmas time when people get homesick, but the best schools to work for rarely lose teachers.\nIf you’re applying for a program, check with them when the applications are open. The deadline is usually sooner than if you’re applying directly.\nThere are a few different ways to find teaching jobs in Spain. Some people recommend that you go to the part of Spain you want to teach and apply directly in person to the schools. This can seem a bit daunting and nerve-wracking, not to mention expensive!\nLuckily, many schools hire online and conduct interviews through Skype.\nBefore your interview, most reputable schools will ask you for an up to date CV, a cover letter, and a recent photograph. You may be asked to take part in a second interview before finding out whether or not your application has been successful.\nRemember, qualifications will vary depending on the kind of job you can apply for, but these extras will be a bonus on any application.\nA few extras that will help your application\n- A bachelor’s degree (especially in language, linguistics, or an English-related subject).\n- TEFL/TESOL/CELTA/CertTESOL certification. Not only does it look good, it may help you negotiate a higher salary.\n- At least basic Spanish. Your students don’t need to know you can speak Spanish, but it’s always good to know what’s going on in your classroom.\n- A warm, friendly personality and a smile – it’s amazing how far this will get you in an interview!\nWhere to find jobs in Spain\nSome of the useful websites where you can find a teaching job in Spain are:\n- https://www.tusclasesparticulares.com (great for finding private classes)\n- https://www.britishcouncil.org/study-work-abroad/outside-uk/english-language-assistants/spain (language assistantship for UK residents)\n- https://uk.april-international.com/en/programmes-d-echanges/comenius-programme (language assistantship for non-native speakers of English)\n- http://www.educacionyfp.gob.es/eeuu/convocatorias-programas/convocatorias-eeuu/auxiliares-conversacion-eeuu.html (Auxiliar program, most popular with US students)\n- List of schools in Spain: https://www.eslbase.com/schools/Spain\nCheck this list of English Teacher Facebook Groups in some regions in Spain that will help you kick start your job hunting campaign:\n- Bilbao English Teachers\n- English Teachers in Malaga\n- TEFL Teachers in Seville\n- English Teachers Galicia\n- Auxiliares de Conversación en Madrid (Less Sensitive Version)\n- Auxiliares in Madrid (The Original)\n- English Teachers in Barcelona\n- Auxiliares de Conversación Salamanca\nHow much can you save/earn while teaching in Spain?\nMost teaching jobs in Spain, you will earn around €1,000 a month after tax for a contract of between 20 – 30 hours a week. Obviously, there is some variation – some schools will add extras into your salary package, such as free accommodation or healthcare etc. This may impact your take home total.\nTeaching in Spain isn’t the first option for those who look to make money from TEFL. The salaries offered are nowhere near as high as the United Arab Emirates, South Korea, or Japan, but they are pretty good when you compare them next to other European countries, and the lifestyle and culture more than makes up for the lower salary.\nIn some schools, accommodation is included in your monthly salary, but this is not commonplace. Flights are very rarely reimbursed, but check all of this with your school in the application process.\nThere are a few factors that will affect how much you can save and earn when living in Spain, the first is of course what type of person you are and how well you manage your money!\nThe second is the location – Barcelona, Madrid, and the coastal regions generally have a higher cost of living. The North of Spain is a lot cheaper when taking living costs into consideration but doesn’t offer the same weather and big city vibes as the regions mentioned above.\nIf you find that you’re struggling to make ends meet in Spain, don’t worry! There are a few things you can do. A great way to make some extra money is giving private classes, which are discussed in the types of teaching jobs section.\nTeachers with a TEFL, TESOL, CELTA or CertTESOL qualification will be able to earn more money than those without.\nTypes of schools\nIf you’re applying to work in Spain, especially in an assistant-ship, you may be able to specify the levels and ages of children you want to work with. The Spanish governmental education system is divided into 4 tiers, which are as follows. Normally, ESO and Bachillerato classes will be held in the same school.\nKnown in English as nursery to pre-school, this is optional and for students who are up to 6 years old. Most students will start their education before they reach the age of 6.\nEducación or Escuela Primaria\nThe first compulsory education for Spanish students comes in educación primaria, or primary education. This is taught to students between 6 and 12 years old.\nESO (Educación Secundaria Obligatoria)\nThe final stage of compulsory education for Spanish students. This is taught between 12 and 16 years old.\nBachillerato (Upper Secondary Education)\nThis level is not compulsory, but Spanish students must complete it if they wish to go on and study at University, which many of them do.\nPrivate school or academia\nAcademias are common all over Spain and are used to accelerate or support what children learn in schools. Academias teach subjects across the curriculum, but many are dedicated to languages, or solely English. Teachers in English academias are often native speakers.\nSpanish students are very chatty, so you’ll need to brush up on your discipline methods before you go. However, for the most part, they’re respectful to their teachers and are willing participants in class.\nTo be accepted into a Spanish University, students need to have at least a B2 in English, no matter what subject they are studying. This is because they will have to read academic papers in English. Therefore, teenagers are often focused and concentrated on their studies.\nCurrently, EU residents do not need a VISA to work in Spain. However, that may change soon for native speakers from the UK depending on the outcome of Brexit.\nFor residents from outside of Europe, it can be a little trickier to get a VISA. Your employer will need to arrange one for you. Due to the fact that many schools teach British English, and Spain’s proximity to the UK, schools may be hesitant to do this. However, if you show in your application process and interview that you’re a good teacher, there’s every chance they’ll sponsor you.\nA way around the VISA system for North American residents is to apply for an auxiliar program. Doing this enables you travel to Spain on a student visa for the first 90 days, where you can then pick up your NIE and start work.\nWherever you’re from, it’s recommended to arrive at least 10 days before to get all of your documents in order so you’re able to start work on the first day of term.\nTravel in Spain\nSpain is a great country to travel around while you’re teaching, especially during holidays and weekends. There are a number of public holidays through the year, and this presents teachers with a lot of travel options.\nIn the North, you have mountain ranges like the Picos de Europa and the Pyrenees, which are great for hiking, mountain biking, and adventure sports.\nSpain’s coastline, especially in the East and the South is sun-drenched and offers great weather year-round. Cities like Barcelona, Madrid, Sevilla, and many more have art, culture, gastronomy scenes and to die for.\nTraveling around Spain isn’t too difficult, but travel times may be longer than you expect (especially for Brits!) There’s an excellent high-speed rail network connecting many of the big cities, and ALSA are the country’s biggest and most reliable inter-city bus service. This is a great option for teachers on a budget.\nIf you want to travel further afield into Europe, of you’re from a different continent and want to return home easily, it’s best to base yourself in close to an airport that’s also a large international hub. Many smaller airports have a limited list of destinations. Some of the biggest airports are in Madrid, Barcelona, Malaga, and Valencia.\nSpanish culture is extremely rich and learning more about it will give you a chance to incorporate it into your lessons and connect with your students.\nIt is best known away from its shores for dance, bullfights, and beaches. However, there’s a lot more to Spanish culture than that. For starters, Castilian Spanish is one of the few native tongues here – depending on where you are you might have to start learning Catalan, Basque, Galician or Asturian! If you learn just a few words in any of these languages, your students will be really impressed.\nJewish, Roman, Moorish, and many more cultures have helped shaped Spain’s into what it is today. Some of the country’s most important and historical sites include the Alhambra Palace, Barcelona’s exquisite Sagrada Familia cathedral, and the ancient city of Toledo.\nArtistically, Spain has one of the richest histories in Europe, producing greats like Picasso, Goya, and the legendary surrealist Salvador Dalí, and that barely even scratches the surface. In your time off, head to the Prado or Reina Sofia museums in Madrid to learn more about the art of this fascinating country.\nAnd of course, who can forget literature? Miguel de Cervantes’ Don Quixote de La Mancha is regarded by many as the greatest literary work ever written.\nThroughout the country, Spain has rich and varying cultures, which each region is rightly proud of. Andalusia, in the south, is the home of the swirling red dresses, staccato guitars, and irresistible rhythm of flamenco.

{"id": "1080", "text": "Remember when our biggest problem was convincing them to eat their veggies? Now, it's about making sure they're ready to stand tall in the adult world. That’s where the magic of a life skills curriculum for young adults comes in. It's not just about the textbooks; it's about real-life know-how.\nWhy life skills matter\nAnd here's the kicker: our educational system is pretty darn good at molding these academic geniuses (check out that fancy word of the day!), but sometimes they miss out on teaching real-life stuff. You know, the kind of things that come in handy when life throws you a curveball. We need to give our teens the tools and skills to confidently say, \"I've got this!\" when faced with unexpected challenges. It's time we bridge that gap and make sure they're prepared for whatever life throws their way.\nTeaching life skills: School vs. real world\nThink about it for a moment. Sure, schools can teach our kids the theory behind budgeting and all that jazz. But it's when we're out there doing our grocery shopping or planning a family vacation that they really start to get the hang of it. Real-life experiences, my friend, they're the ultimate teacher.\nLet's go a little deeper here. While schools do play a big role in educating our kiddos, there's just something special about the home environment. It's where our kids learn so many valuable lessons. Yeah, sure, schools can teach them about budgeting, but it's at home where they see firsthand how to make smart choices, set priorities, and understand the value of money. Those trips to the store or planning a trip become these amazing opportunities to put those skills into practice.\nAnd you know what else? We, as parents, have the chance to reinforce all those life skills taught at school. We can take what they've learned and bring it to life with practical applications. Schools may talk about effective communication, but it's at home where our kids can practice those skills by talking and interacting with us. And when it comes to problem-solving, well, real-life challenges at home are perfect for flexing those critical thinking muscles.\nSo, let's not just leave it all up to the schools, alright? As parents, we can step up and be co-educators. We bring our own experiences and wisdom to the table, complementing what the schools teach. By seizing everyday moments, having meaningful discussions, and encouraging hands-on learning, we can empower our kids to become confident and capable individuals. We want them to have all the essential life skills they need to thrive out there in the real world, don't we?\nTeaching life skills at home\nOh, and remember those intense debates you used to have around the dinner table (okay, maybe they were more like arguments, but bear with me)? Well, here's the thing – encourage them! These fiery discussions actually help your teen develop their persuasive skills, which will come in handy in the real world (just make sure they don't always argue about why they desperately need the latest iPhone). So, embrace those lively conversations and watch your teenager become a master communicator.\nIntegrating life skill lessons into daily life\nRemember when Mia had to figure out her college budget? By introducing our kids to these responsibilities early on, we're setting them up for success so that they won't feel totally overwhelmed when they're out on their own. Cool, right? Sneaky too.\nResources for parents\nDon’t be afraid to “force the issue”. Sign them up for life skill courses for the skills you don’t feel qualified to teach them. That still qualifies as YOU teaching them.\nCheck out our resources for helping parents prepare their teens for independence and adulthood.\nBenefits of teaching life skills to your teens\nLet's take this journey together\nCheers to raising the next generation of confident, competent adults! 🌟", "scores": {"score": 3, "score_transform_1": 5, "score_transform_2": 5, "score_transform_3": 0}}

{"id": "1094", "text": "Once upon a time, Ray Radam was scared of tech industry, despite being a gamer. But he went from nursing to Uber driver to Linux expert.\nRay once had an Uber passenger tell him it was possible to work in IT without a four-year degree. His curiosity was piqued, but he didn’t pursue the matter then because “it’s scary to just go online… because you’re going to be hooked on scammers,” a plausible excuse not to. He wasn’t actively looking, but when he came across Yellow Tail Tech, he was very thankful because “they made it happen for me.”\nSo how did Ray end up with a job in Linux? An ad in the middle of his game, of course.\nLet’s figure out exactly how gaming brought Ray to where he is now.\nLevel One: It’s-a Them! Yellow Tail!\nRay was a self-proclaimed gaming addict. He loved mobile games, and he always played them. One day, Ray came across an ad talking about a hybrid program, something that piqued his interest. Ray didn’t even finish the ad before booking with Yellow Tail.\nWhile being in tech industry has curbed this addiction, Ray still likes to play games as a hobby. Now, he plays on other consoles, like a PS4 and a PS5. But his first love will always be mobile games, and now his phone allows him to apply his honed skills to Linux.\nLevel Two: The Cake Isn’t a Lie This Time\nRay is one of those IT career shifters with a background in tech. He’s been interested in Linux since he was in high school. Even as he studied to become a nurse and worked as an Uber driver, Ray used Linux as a hobby. Like his mobile games, he figured Linux was just a pastime. He wasn’t convinced even when a passenger told him an IT career was possible without a tech degree.\nRay did try to get into cybersecurity, but it didn’t pan out. There was no framework, making it difficult to learn and progress. Thankfully, Yellow Tail delivered on that front; it proved to him that Linux is more than just a hobby and that there’s a market for it. Thanks to Yellow Tail Tech’s framework and instruction, Ray could put his passion for computers to use.\nBy itself, Linux is a popular operating system used in many industries, but Ray chose it because of his history and love for it. He emphasized how “when you learn Linux, your doors are open” to work with AWS and cybersecurity. His advice: “Start with Linux, build the foundation from there, and then spread out after it.”\nLevel Three: There’s No “X” To Press and Doubt\nYellow Tail Tech was the only school Ray tried. Sure, he tried to get into cybersecurity for a bit, but that wasn’t really a school. He had to learn by himself and through whatever means he could. There wasn’t a schedule, and he didn’t know what to do without much organization.\nIn Yellow Tail Tech, Ray found the structure he needed. With it, he could happily focus on learning Linux. He especially liked how there were three tiers to choose from. Despite his background, Ray found the first section—in which he was taught the basics—to be the most enjoyable. In the next stage, he was pleased to learn commands “related to passing your certification and also related [to] work because there are a lot of ways to do [things] in Linux.”\nBut learning practical skills that he can put to use at work is Ray’s favorite part of Yellow Tail Tech. This is part of what he calls the third stage. He learned it’s okay to disagree with people because, “trust me, at work, they’re going to have more disagreement.”\nRay especially appreciated being hired for the talents he had spent so much time developing. He was taught flexibility in the face of vague rules, and recruiters now call him for his skills. It’s a notable difference from before he got into IT.\nBonus Level: Being Filled With Determination\nIn gaming, players will never level up if they don’t try. It didn’t matter how often they failed; they simply tried again. That’s how Ray learned perseverance through gaming.\nRay drew strength from the lessons he learned as he persevered through video games to overcome the challenges he faced in real life. That he’s now working a job he loves after working in different careers is a true testament to his skills in Linux and gaming.\nNow, Ray looks at the games he plays and sees how he can apply his skills. Linux is present in many games, and Ray thinks gamers could use it to learn how their games work. Some gamers like learning what their games are made of, so Ray suggests checking out Linux: “I think it would be easier for you [gamers] to transfer into tech industry because you’re already using computers, to begin with.”\nNot every gamer would want to know the meat and potatoes of the games they play, but Ray says, “It’s not for application. It’s for gaming. But the concept [is] there. So from there, you can just explore.” Besides, anyone who wants to be a game developer can also use these skills. As Ray says, “knock yourself out.”\nBoss Battle: Enduring, Surviving, and Enjoying Life\nIn the end, getting into a tech industry is all about determination and perseverance. Yes, passion plays a huge role in Ray’s success, but he couldn’t have done it if he wasn’t so determined.\nGaming had a role to play in Ray’s success as well. He wouldn’t be so used to facing setbacks if he didn’t experience them in his games and life. No matter how “small” video games seem to other people, they were an important springboard for Ray.\nYellow Tail Tech wishes Ray the best of luck in his adventures!

Pomegranate (Punica granatum L.) is well known for its high concentration of polyphenolic compounds and for its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.\nThe aim of this study was to analyze the photoprotection provided by Punica granatum seed oil nanoemulsion entrapping the polyphenol-rich ethyl acetate fraction against UVB-induced DNA damage in the keratinocyte HaCaT cell line. For this purpose, HaCaT cells were pretreated for 1 h with nanoemulsions in a serum-free medium and then irradiated with UVB (90–200 mJ/cm2) rays.\nFluorescence microscopy analysis provided information about the cellular internalization of the nanodroplets. We also determined thein vitro SPF of the nanoemulsions and evaluated their phototoxicity using the 3T3 Neutral Red Uptake Phototoxicity Test.\nThe nanoemulsions were able to protect the cells’ DNA against UVB-induced damage in a concentration dependent manner. Nanodroplets were internalized by the cells but a higher proportion was detected along the cell membrane. The SPF obtained (~ 25) depended on the concentration of the ethyl acetate fraction and pomegranate seed oil in the nanoemulsion.\nThe photoprotective formulations were classified as non-phototoxic. In conclusion, nanoemulsions entrapping the polyphenol-rich ethyl acetate fraction show potential for use as a sunscreen product.\nOur results suggest that pomegranate seed oil nanoemulsion entrapping pomegranate peel polyphenol-rich extract has great potential to be used as a sunscreen. EAF-loaded NE were internalized by the keratinocyte cells and also accumulated along the cell membrane.\nFormulations protected the cells’ DNA against UVB-induced damage, protection was concentration dependent. The SPF determined for EAF-loaded NE was relatively high given that no synthetic filters were involved.\nNo phototoxic effect was observed after incubation of EAF or EAF-loaded NE with 3T3 mouse fibroblasts or human keratinocyte HaCaT at the concentration tested. The data presented here can be considered a starting point for the initiation of the use of pomegranate seed oil nanoemulsion entrapping pomegranate peel polyphenol-rich extract for photoprotection against UVB radiation and its damaging effects on human skin. However, further studies are needed to better understand this photoprotective effect.", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}
{"id": "1117", "text": "\"Kapila said, 'The Vedas are regarded as authoritative by all. People never\ndisregard them. Brahma is of two kinds, viz., Brahma as represented by sound, and Brahma as Supreme (and intangible). 1 One conversant with Brahma represented by sound succeeds in attaining to Supreme Brahma. Commencing with the rites of Garbhadhana, that body which the sire creates with the aid of Vedic mantras is cleansed (after birth) by Vedic mantras. 2 When the body has been cleansed with purificatory rites (performed with the aid of Vedic mantras), the owner there of come to be called a Brahmana and becomes a vessel fit for receiving knowledge of Brahma. Know that the reward of acts is purity of heart which only leads to Emancipation. I shall presently speak to thee of that. Whether purity of heart has been attained or not (by performance of acts) is what can be known to the person himself who has attained it. It can never be known with the aid of either the Vedas or inference. They that cherish no expectation, that discard every kind of wealth by not storing anything for future use, that are not covetous, and that are free from every kind of affection and aversion, perform sacrifices because of the conviction that their performance is a duty. To make gifts unto deserving persons is the end (right use) of all wealth. Never addicted at any time to sinful acts, observant of those rites that have been laid down in the Vedas, capable of crowning all their wishes with fruition, endued with certain conclusions through pure knowledge, never giving way to wrath,--never indulging in envy, free from pride and malice, firm in Yoga, 3 of unstained birth, unstained conduct, and unstained learning, devoted to the good of all creatures, there were in days of yore many men, leading lives of domesticity and thoroughly devoted to their own duties, there were many kings also of the same qualifications, devoted to Yoga (like Janaka, etc.), and many Brahmanas also of the same character (like Yajnavalkya and others). 4 They behaved equally towards all creatures and were endued with perfect sincerity. Contentment was theirs, and certainty of knowledge. Visible were the rewards of their righteousness, and pure were they in behaviour and heart. They were possessed of faith in Brahma of both forms. 5 At first making their hearts pure, they duly observed all (excellent) vows. They were observant of the duties of righteousness on even occasions of distress and difficulty, without failing off in any particular. Uniting together they used to perform meritorious acts. In this they found great happiness. And inasmuch as they never tripped, they had never to perform any expiation. Relying as they did\nupon the true course of righteousness, they became endued with irresistible energy. They never followed their own understandings in the matter of earning merit but followed the dictates of the scriptures alone for that end. Accordingly they were never guilty of guile in the matter of performing acts of righteousness. 1 In consequence of their observing unitedly the absolute ordinances of the scriptures without betaking themselves ever to the rites laid down in the alternative, they were never under the necessity of performing expiation. 2 There is no expiation for men living in the observance of the ordinances laid down in the scriptures. The Sruti declares that expiation exists for only men that are weak and unable to follow the absolute and substantive provisions of the sacred law. Many Brahmanas there were of this kind in days of old, devoted to the performance of sacrifices, of profound knowledge of the Vedas, possessed of purity and good conduct, and endued with fame. They always worshipped Brahma in the sacrifices, and were free from desire. Possessed of learning they transcended all the bonds of life. The sacrifices of these men, their (knowledge of the) Vedas, their acts performed in obedience to the ordinances, their study of the scripture at the fixed hours, and the wishes they entertained, freed as they were from lust and wrath, observant as they were of pious conduct and acts notwithstanding all difficulties, renowned as they were for performing the duties of their own order and mode of life, purified as their souls were in consequence of their very nature, characterised as they were by thorough sincerity, devoted as they were to tranquillity, and mindful as they were of their own practices, were identical with Infinite Brahma. Even this is the eternal Sruti heard by us. 3 The penances of men that were so high-souled, of men whose conduct and acts were so difficult of observance and accomplishment, of men whose wishes were crowned with fruition in consequence of the strict discharge of their duties, became efficacious weapons for the destruction of all earthly desires. The Brahmanas say that that Good Conduct, which is wonderful, whose origin may be traced to very ancient times, which is eternal and whose characteristics are unchangeable, which differs from the practices to which even the good resort in seasons of distress and represents their acts in other situations, which is identical with heedfulness, over which lust and wrath and other evil passions can never prevail, and in consequence of which there was (at one time) no transgression in all mankind, subsequently came to be distributed into four subdivisions, corresponding with the four modes of life by persons unable to\npractise its duties in minute detail and entirety. 1 They that are good, by duly observing that course of Good Conduct after adoption of the Sannyasa mode of life, attain to the highest end. They also that betake themselves to the forest mode reach the same high end (by duly observing that conduct). They too that observe the domestic mode of life attain to the highest end (by duly practising the same conduct); and, lastly, those that lead the Brahmacharya mode obtain the same (end by a due observance of the same conduct). 2 Those Brahmanas are seen to shine in the firmament as luminaries shedding beneficent rays of light all around. Those myriads of Brahmanas have become stars and constellations set in their fixed tracks. In consequence of contentment (or Renunciation) they have all attained to Infinity as the Vedas declare. If such men have to come back to the world through the wombs of living creatures, they are never stained by sins which have the unexhausted residue of previous acts for their originating cause. Indeed, one who has led the life of a Brahmacharin and waited dutifully upon his preceptor, who has arrived at settled conclusions (in respect of the soul), and who has devoted himself to Yoga thus, is truly a Brahmana. Who else would deserve to be called a Brahmana? When acts alone determine who is a Brahmana and who is not, acts (good or bad) must be held to indicate the happiness or misery of a person. As regards those that have by conquering all evil passions acquired purity of heart, we have heard the eternal Sruti that in consequence of the Infinity to which they attain (through beholding the universal soul) and of the knowledge of Brahma (they acquire through the declarations of Srutis), they behold everything to be Brahma. The duties (of tranquillity, self-restraint, abstention from acts, renunciation, devotion, and the abstraction of Samadhi) followed by those men of pure hearts, that are freed from desire, and that have Emancipation only for their object, for acquisition of the knowledge of Brahma, are equally laid down for all the four orders of men and all the four modes of life. Verily, that knowledge is always acquired by Brahmanas of pure hearts and restrained soul. 3 One whose soul is for Renunciation\nbased upon contentment is regarded as the refuge of true knowledge. Renunciation, in which is that knowledge which leads to Emancipation, and which is highly necessary for a Brahmana, is eternal (and comes down from preceptor to pupil for ever and ever). 1 Renunciation sometimes exists mixed with the duties of other modes. But whether existing in that state or by itself, one practises it according to the measure of one's strength (that depends upon the degree of one's absence of worldly desires). Renunciation is the cause of supreme benefit unto every kind of person. Only he that is weak, fails to practise it. That pure-hearted man who seeks to attain to Brahma becomes rescued from the world (with its misery).' 2\n\"Syumarasmi said, 'Amongst those that are given up to enjoyment (of property), they that make gifts, they that perform sacrifices, they that devote themselves to the study of the Vedas, and they that betake themselves to a life of Renunciation after having acquired and enjoyed wealth and all its pleasures, when they depart from this world, who is it that attains to the foremost place in heaven? I ask thee this, O Brahmana! Do thou tell me truly.'\n\"Kapila said, 'Those who lead a life of domesticity are certainly auspicious and acquire excellence of every kind. They are unable, however, to enjoy the felicity that attaches to Renunciation. Even thou mayst see this.' 3\n\"Syumarasmi said, 'Ye depend upon knowledge as the means (for the attainment of Emancipation). Those who lead lives of domesticity have planted their faith in acts. It has, however, been said that the end of all modes of life is Emancipation. 4 No difference, therefore, is observable between them in respect of either their superiority or inferiority of puissance. O illustrious one, do thou tell me then how stands the matter truly.'\n\"Kapila said, 'Acts only cleanse the body. Knowledge, however, is the highest end (for which one strives). 5 When all faults of the heart are cured (by acts), and when the felicity of Brahma becomes established in knowledge,\nbenevolence, forgiveness, tranquillity, compassion, truthfulness, and candour, abstention from injury, absence of pride, modesty, renunciation, and abstention from work are attained. These constitute the path that lead to Brahma. By those one attains to what is the Highest. That the cure of all faults of the heart is the result of acts becomes intelligible to the wise man when these are attained. That, indeed, is regarded as the highest end which is obtained by Brahmanas endued with wisdom, withdrawn from all acts, possessed of purity and the certitude of knowledge. One who succeeds in acquiring a knowledge of the Vedas, of that which is taught by the Vedas (viz., Brahma as represented in acts), and the minutiae of acts, is said to be conversant with the Vedas. Any other man is only a bag of wind. 1 One who is conversant with the Vedas knows everything, for everything is established on the Vedas. Verity, the present, past, and future all exist in the Vedas. 2 This one conclusion is deducible from all the scriptures, viz., that this universe exists and does not exist. To the man of knowledge this (all that is perceived) is both sat and asat. To him, this all is both the end and the middle. 3 This truth rests upon all the Vedas, viz., that when complete Renunciation takes place one obtains what is sufficient. Then again the highest contentment follows and rests upon Emancipation, 4 which is absolute, which exists as the soul of all mortal and immortal things, which is well-known as such universal soul, which is the highest object of knowledge as being identical with all mobile and immobile things, which is full, which is perfect felicity, which is without duality, which is the foremost of all things, which is Brahma, which is Unmanifest and the cause also, whence the Unmanifest has sprung, and which is without deterioration of any kind. 5 Ability to subdue the senses, forgiveness, and abstention from work in consequence of the absence of desire,--these three are the cause of perfect felicity. With the aid of these three qualities, men having understanding for their eyes succeed in reaching that Brahma which is\nuncreate, which is the prime cause of the universe, which is unchangeable and which is beyond destruction. I bow to that Brahma, which is identical with him that knows it.'\" 1", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}

{"id": "1142", "text": "I recently read Michael Pollan’s 2018 book How to Change Your Mind* since it was highly recommended by a neighbor of mine. I didn’t realize it was a bestseller since popular books rarely find their way onto my stack of books to be read. I took a break from my pile of nondual books and peeked at it; the next thing I knew I was immersed.\nFor those unfamiliar with Pollan (pictured at right), he is the author of five New York Times bestsellers, mostly on food. In 2010, Pollan was named to the 2010 TIME 100, the magazine’s annual list of the world’s 100 most influential people. That year he was awarded the Lennon Ono Grant for Peace by Yoko Ono. In 2009 Newsweek named him one of the top 10 “New Thought Leaders.”\nSince 2003, Pollan has been the John S. and James L. Knight Professor of Journalism at UC Berkeley’s Graduate School of Journalism. He has been a contributing writer to The New York Times Magazine since 1987.\nPollan is a terrific writer and a gifted researcher. I had only heard of him as a food expert and never read any of his books or columns. I found his wordsmithing skill quite masterful.\nThe first of three sections of the book reviews the history of psychedelic research and, to my surprise, I knew many of the people he mentions who were at the forefront of the research until it went underground in the 1970s when a national wave of fear and investment in the status quo resulted in the end of research funding and government contracts.\nNow I was hooked. Nothing like mentioning nine or ten colleagues whose work I am familiar with to get me engaged. I hadn’t realized how many of the movers and shakers in the field I knew.\nThe second section of the book focuses on Pollan’s own experiments with altered states, all involving different substances. His amazing writing skill and his openness to share his experiences makes for captivating reading. Naturally I compared my own experiences with altered states to Pollan’s, feeling great empathy and reviving many extraordinary memories.\nThe point of mentioning Pollan and his book is that the experiences he writes about – those of many volunteers for different research studies whom he interviewed as well as his own – so closely emulate that nondual space I have been writing about recently.\nWhen I first picked up the book I thought I would be taking a break from my studying the teachings of various nondual gurus and researching the subject for the book I’m planning to co-author with Richard Miller. By the time I finished the Pollan book, however, I realized that reading it was not a detour I had taken but actually provided more perspectives and wisdom on the focus of my attention – unity consciousness or the nondual realm.\nPollan’s research subjects included meditators, people who facilitated psychedelic journeys with volunteers using a variety of substances and the volunteers themselves. He describes a common experience where “the ego temporarily vanishes and the usual boundaries we experience between self and world, subject and object, all melt away.” He continues:\nThis sense of merging into some larger totality is of course one of the hallmarks of the mystical experience; our sense of individuality and separateness hinges on a bounded self and a clear demarcation between subject and object. But all that may be a mental construction, a kind of illusion – just as the Buddhists have been trying to tell us. The psychedelic experience of “non-duality” suggests that consciousness survives the disappearance of self, that it is not so indispensable as we – and it – like to think.\nThe “mental construction” or “illusion” Pollan addresses is similar to what I called a “pretense” in my February newsletter editorial“The Greatest Pretender.”\nWhether accessing this unity consciousness using meditation, breath work, or a “sacred medicine” of one type or another one is able to suspend one’s ego, at least temporarily, and experience the realm of oneness, an experience that tends to change one’s worldview forever.\n*Pollan, Michael, How to Change Your Mind, Penguin Press, New York, 2018", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

Children do not come in pieces. Food, shelter, health care and other supports from the earliest years would offer hope and opportunity for a better future to millions of children and create a stronger workforce for our nation tomorrow. Children only have one childhood. Shamefully more than 15.5 million children are poor in America—the world’s largest economy.

There is plenty of liquidity in the markets,\" Rajan said. \"There is an incentive for banks to lower rates in April as a high amount of liquidity would be released into the banking system,\" Rajan said.\nRajan said \"when banks have to raise rates, they quote higher policy rates... Why don't they cut when policy rates go down.\" He was speaking after releasing first bi-monthly report on monetary policy, 2015-16.\nUrging banks to cut rates, Rajan said, \"the sooner rate transmission happens, better it is for the economy.\" Rajan said that RBI's stance (on interest rates) has turned accommodative in January and it remains so.\nBase rate, which is the minimum lending rate for retail consumers, continues to be in double digits. Lowering of base rate will boost demand for home and auto loans, which will drive consumer demand and help the economy.\nAccording to Rajan, banks will be forced to cut lending rates due to competitive pressures.\"At some point the competitive pressures on banks will tell. Many corporations are borrowing directly from the market. I have no doubt, that this (transmission of rate cut) will happen, If it happens sooner, it is better for the economy, but banks have to make their own decision,\" Rajan said.\n\"What we (RBI) have to make sure from a regulatory perspective is that regulation does not standing in the way of cutting rates. Remember that the base rate does not seem to stand in the way of banks, when they raise the rate as a result of interest rate hike. It only seems to come in the way when interest rates are cut,\" Rajan said.\nThe RBI review says that outlook for growth is improving gradually. \"Comfortable liquidity conditions should enable banks to transmit the recent reductions in the policy rate into their lending rates, thereby improving financing conditions for the productive sectors of the economy,\" RBI said.\nRBI has even said that any further cut in rates will be contingent on banks passing on rate cuts. \"Going forward, the accommodative stance of monetary policy will be maintained, but monetary policy actions will be conditioned by incoming data. The Reserve Bank will await the transmission by banks of its front-loaded rate reductions in January and February into their lending rates,\" the policy statement said.\nIn Tuesday's policy announcement, the RBI held repo rate unchanged at 7.5 per cent, as expected. Another key ratio, the CRR or cash reserve ratio, which is the amount of deposits lenders must keep with the RBI, was also left unchanged at 4 per cent.\n\"What we are waiting for is more information about the effect of weather disturbances and more information on the likelihood of reasonable monsoons,\" he said.\nTo issue priority sector lending norms by month end.\nWaiting to see transmission of interest rates.\nNext rate cut will depend on effective transmission of policy stance by banks.\nTiming of future cuts will depend on how much room we have.\nBanks over time will be forced to match markets and bring rates down.\nThere has to incentive and willingness for the banks to move on rates.\nExploring the possibility of corporates issues rupee bonds abroad.\nMust ensure small savings rate don't stand in way of banks lowering rates.\nImproved economic fundamentals will allow us to focus on domestic policy.\nAllowing well managed urban co-operative banks to issue credit card.\nFirst Bi-monthly Monetary Policy Statement, 2015-16\nThe Monetary Policy Report – April 2015: Click here\nBrihanMumbai municipal corporation is floating nearly 900 tenders worth of Rs 150 crore in the next 10 days, but that is only for ward-level civic works, the BMC clarified on Monday, reacting to reports in a section of media. “Since there are 25 wards in BMC, it involves m\nIn a first-of-its-kind initiative, Election Commission of India (ECI) on Monday signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with two prominent organisations, the Indian Banks’ Association (IBA) and the Department of Posts (DoP), to amplify its voter outreach and awareness efforts ahead of the forthcom\nSnakes, Drugs and Rock ’N’ Roll: My Early Years By Romulus Whitaker with Janaki Lenin HarperCollins, 400 pages, Rs 699\nThe Moral Contagion By Julia Hauser and Sarnath Banerjee HarperCollins, 140 pages, Rs 699 The world has lar\nAddressing the Viksit Bharat Viksit Uttar Pradesh program in Lucknow on Monday, prime minister Narendra Modi launched 14,000 projects across the state, worth more than Rs 10 lakh crore at the fourth groundbreaking ceremony of UP Global Investors Summit held in February 2023.

{"id": "1268", "text": "Director: James DeMonaco\nWriter: James DeMonaco\nCinematographer: Jacques Jouffret\nby Jon Cvack\nWith a 2.7 recommended rating, I took my time getting to this one. After watching both the original and the sequel back to back, I have to say it stands to become one of the coolest horror series since Saw. And since I’m near-alone in thinking that the Saw series was so awesome, maybe the best since the Scream series.\nThe idea is simple - a putative Far Right faction called the New Founding Fathers has reformed the government, who have instituted a 12 hour period during the spring equinox, in which anyone can kill or be killed (except for politicians, who are exempt). I see that Wikipedia calls this a totalitarian regime and police state, but I’d refute this given that - with the exception of The Purge’s half day murder marathon - nothing else has really changed from anyone’s day to day to life.\nThe story revolves around James Sandlin (Ethan Hawke) who has acquired an extravagant amount of wealth by selling complex house security systems for this one half day out of the year. His wife, Mary (Lena Headey) despises The Purge and expresses discomfort for the whole event. Her children Zoey (Adelaide Kane) and Charlie (Max Burkholder) are fairly normal kids, with Charlie developing a strange, camera device that has a camera inside a half burned doll head, positioned upon a miniature motorized tank, while Zoey explores the lascivious side of her teenage years with an older boyfriend who the father has condemned. The family sits down to a meal. There’s the typical fighting and making up, it’s all so normal. And then The Purge begins. James assembles everyone in their home’s security hub and enables the shutdown sequence - the cameras go on, the metal doors engage, covering all the windows and doors, protecting them from any unwanted visited while trapping them inside.\nWhat worked for me were the unexpected choices of each of the characters. With Charlie, I figured he was attracted to the murders, exemplified by his creepy eyebrows and macabre toys, and we discover he actually felt a moral obligation to help one of the homeless people. With the homeless man (Edwin Hodge), I figured he’d have changed things up, hoping to get into the house in order to murder them all. Zoey’s boyfriend, while mildly predictable, was interesting for how quickly James shot him ded. Even the actual invaders, specifically the leader (Rhys Wakefield), did a phenomenal job of explaining to what end the rich see the event; something the sequel would explore in more detail; that is, in order to combat against poverty, the rich could kill off the poor. It’s their absolute right. After, you realize that this idea of economic inequality extends to the neighbors who turn on the Sadlins, who believe they exploited the day for their own financial benefit (via James’ security systems) and don’t deserve to live such an extravagant life.\nIt is now clear that just as torture porn dominated the 00s, these home invasion films are starting to take center stage - with the success of You’re Next, The Strangers, Straw Dogs remake, and with how wildly successful The Purge was (having taken in $89 million against its measly $3 million budget), it's clear that this is horror's new sub-genre. As inequality rises, I think these films are exploring an interesting idea, well embodied in James Spandlin who we discover has no idea whether or not the security system can actually function and thus the whole story is a comeuppance for his exploiting people’s vulnerabilities for his own personal gain. And yet he adds a humanity to the character. He’s a good dad, who wants the best for his family, and ends up paying for the corners he cut.\nBELOW: The shutdown sequence. One of the best hooks in all of horror\n© Jonathan Cvack and Yellow Barrel, 2015 - 2020.

This type of interior can also appear ‘flat’ if you don’t introduce texture and subtle tonal variety. But put together carefully, it’s a great way to add drama and style, as Meg’s bathroom beautifully demonstrates.\nWhile monochrome decorating can be tricky to get right, a considered approach will be rewarded by a simple but impactful scheme. This bathroom color scheme can work especially well in older homes, where a one-tone canvas serves to highlight and complement original features, or when you want statement bathroom tile ideas and fittings should stand to attention.\nDepending on whether you choose equal measures of black and white, or more black, the combination can evoke different moods, lending itself to schemes that feel glamorous, moody, or bright and cheerful.\nChoose furniture and fittings with strong shapes and clean lines that will stand out against a bold black-and-white scheme, and keep accessories simple for a modern look.\nContrasting black with white is the most effective way to create impact in a predominantly white bathroom, but the key is to vary proportions. A 50/50 split could feel too dramatic; instead pair black accessories and fixtures with white bathroom tiles and another vital ingredient: texture.\nShop the black-and-white bathroom edit\nBlack and white, the color combination so beloved by Meg Ryan, offers the perfect way to create a stylish bathroom.

{"id": "1304", "text": "In 1958, a year after it achieved independence from colonial rule, Ghana hosted a conference of African leaders, the first such gathering to ever take place on the continent. At the invitation of Ghana’s newly elected prime minister, Kwame Nkrumah, more than 300 leaders from 28 territories across Africa attended, including Patrice Lumumba of the still-Belgian Congo and Frantz Fanon, who was then living in still-French Algeria. It was a time of unlimited potential for a group of people determined to chart a new course for their homelands. But the host wanted his guests not to forget the dangers ahead of them. “Do not let us also forget that colonialism and imperialism may come to us yet in a different guise—not necessarily from Europe.”\nIn fact, the agents Nkrumah feared were already present. Not long after the event began, Ghanaian police arrested a journalist who had been hiding in one of the conference rooms while apparently trying to record a closed breakout session. As it was later discovered, the journalist actually worked for a CIA front organization, one of many represented at the event.\nBritish scholar Susan Williams has spent years documenting these and other instances of the United States’ secret operations during the early years of African independence. The resulting book, White Malice: The CIA and the Covert Recolonization of Africa, may be the most thorough investigation to date of CIA involvement in Africa in the late 1950s and early 1960s. Over more than 500 pages, Williams counters the lies, deceptions, and pleas of innocence perpetuated by the CIA and other US agencies to reveal a government that never let its failure to grasp the motivations of Africa’s leaders stop it from intervening, often violently, to undermine or overthrow them.\nThough a few other African countries appear on the sidelines, White Malice overwhelmingly concerns just two that preoccupied the CIA during this period: Ghana and what is now the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Ghana’s appeal to the agency was based merely on its place in history. As the first African nation to gain independence, in 1957, and the homeland of Nrukmah—by far the most widely respected advocate of African self-determination of the day—the nation was inevitably a source of intrigue. The Congo stepped out of its colonial shackles soon after, in 1960. Because of its size, position near southern Africa’s bastions of white rule, and reserves of high-quality uranium at the Shinkolobwe mine in Katanga province, the country soon became the next locus of the agency’s attention—and interference—in Africa.\n“This is a turning point in the history of Africa,” Nkrumah told Ghana’s National Assembly during a visit from Congolese Prime Minister Lumumba a few weeks into the Congo’s self-rule. “If we allow the independence of the Congo to be compromised in any way by the imperialist and capitalist forces, we shall expose the sovereignty and independence of all Africa to grave risk.”\nNkrumah possessed an acute understanding of the threat and of the people behind it. Only months after his speech, Lumumba was assassinated by a Belgian and Congolese firing squad, opening the door to decades of pro-western tyranny in the country.\nLumumba’s assassination is remembered today as one of the low points of the early years of African independence, but a lacking documentary record has allowed partisan investigators to minimize the CIA’s role. It’s a failure of accountability which has allowed the agency to appear blameless while reinforcing a fatalistic view of African history, as if the murder of an elected official was merely another terrible thing that had “just happened” to a people utterly unprepared for the challenge of independence.\nBut as Williams shows, the CIA was actually one of the chief architects of the plot. Only days after Lumumba’s visit to Ghana, Larry Devlin, the agency’s leading man in the Congo, warned his bosses of a vague takeover plot involving the Soviets, Ghanaians, Guineans, and the local communist party. It was “difficult [to] determine major influencing factors,” he said. Despite a complete lack of evidence, he was certain the “decisive period” when the Congo would align itself with the Soviet Union was “not far off.” Soon after, President Eisenhower verbally ordered the CIA to assassinate Lumumba.\nThe CIA’s agents did not, in the end, man the firing squad to kill Lumumba. But as Williams makes clear, that distinction is minor when one considers everything else the agency did to assist in the murder. After inventing and disseminating the bogus conspiracy plot of a pro-Soviet takeover, the CIA leveraged its multitude of sources in Katanga to provide intelligence to Lumumba’s enemies, making his capture possible. They helped to deliver him to the Katanga prison where he was held before his execution. Williams even cites a few lines from a recently declassified CIA expense report to show that Devlin, the station chief, ordered one of his agents to visit the prison not long before the bullets were fired.\nWhen Nkrumah learned of Lumumba’s assassination, he felt it “in a very keen and personal way,” according to June Milne, his British research assistant. But horrifying as the news was to him, the Ghanaian statesman was hardly surprised.\nWhite Malice is a triumph of archival research, and its best moments come when Williams allows the actors on both sides to speak for themselves. While books about African independence often show Nkrumah and his peers to be paranoid and hopelessly idealistic, reading their words alongside a mountain of evidence of CIA misdeeds, one sees how fear and idealism were entirely pragmatic reactions to the threats of the day. Nkrumah’s vision of African unity wasn’t the pipe dream of a naive and untested politician; it was a necessary response to a concerted effort to divide and weaken the continent.\nIn Nkrumah’s own country, the US government appears not to have pursued a course of outright assassination. But it acted in other ways to undermine the Ghanaian leader, often justifying its ploys with the same kinds of paternalistic rationalizations the British had used before them. Those efforts reached their nadir in 1964, when the US State Department’s West Africa specialists sent a memo to G. Mennen Williams, the department’s head of African affairs, titled, “Proposed Action Program for Ghana.” The United States, it said, should start making “intensive efforts” involving “psychological warfare and other means to diminish support for Nkrumah within Ghana and nurture the conviction among the Ghanaian people that their country’s welfare and independence necessitate his removal.” In another file from that year, an official from Britain’s Commonwealth Relations Office mentions a plan, ostensibly approved at the highest levels of the foreign service, for “covert and unattributable attacks on Nkrumah.”\nThe level of coordination between governments within and outside the United States might have shocked Nkrumah, who, until the end of his life, was at least willing to believe the CIA was a rogue agency, accountable to no one, not even US presidents.\nWhite Malice leaves little doubt, if any still existed, that the CIA did grave harm to Africa in its early days of independence, often violently. But while Williams presents numerous instances of the CIA and other agencies undermining African governments, often violently, the CIA’s wider strategy in Africa—apart from denying uranium and allies to the Soviet Union—remains opaque. What we call “colonization” as practiced by Britain, France, Belgium, and others involved a vast machinery of exploitation—schools to train children to speak the masters’ language, railroads to deplete the interior of resources—all maintained by an army of functionaries. But even in the Congo, the CIA’s presence was comparatively small. Huge budgets and the freedom to do virtually whatever they wanted in the name of fighting communism gave them an outsize influence over Africa’s history, but their numbers never rivaled the colonial bureaucracies they supposedly replaced.\nWilliams shows how the CIA plotted with business people who stood to benefit from pro-western African governments in both the Congo and Ghana. But far from a systematic practice of extraction, the agency’s designs for Africa often seem befuddled with contradiction.\nThat is especially true in the aftermath of Lumumba’s assassination; an overabundance of secrecy still prevents a full accounting. But what records have been pried from the agency’s hands reveal details of a multitude of CIA aerial operations in the Congo, involving planes owned by agency front companies and pilots who were themselves CIA personnel. During a period of upheaval, the agency appears to be everywhere in the country at once. “But,” Williams writes, “it is a confusing situation in which the CIA appears to have been riding several horses at once that were going in different directions.” The agency “supported [Katangan secessionist president Moïse] Tshombe’s war on the UN; it supported the UN mission in the Congo; and it supported the Congolese Air Force, the air arm of the Leopoldville government.”\nAs contradictory as these efforts seem to have been, all of them, Williams writes, “contributed to the objective of keeping the whole of the Congo under America’s influence and guarding the Shinkolobwe mine against Soviet incursion.”\nEven if such conflicting plans shared a common goal, it’s not unreasonable to ask whether we should consider them “colonialism”—neo- or otherwise—or rather the schizophrenic response of an agency drunk with power it never should have been afforded. In White Malice, the CIA’s capacity for committing murder and sowing discord is on full display. Its capacity to rule, however, is less so.", "scores": {"score": 3, "score_transform_1": 5, "score_transform_2": 5, "score_transform_3": 0}}

{"id": "1370", "text": "Building Self-Esteem: A Self-Help Guide - Contents:\nChanging Negative Thoughts About Yourself To Positive Ones\nYou may be giving yourself negative messages about yourself. Many people do. These are messages that you learned when you were young. You learned from many different sources including other children, your teachers, family members, caregivers, even from the media, and from prejudice and stigma in our society.\nOnce you have learned them, you may have repeated these negative messages over and over to yourself, especially when you were not feeling well or when you were having a hard time. You may have come to believe them. You may have even worsened the problem by making up some negative messages or thoughts of your own. These negative thoughts or messages make you feel bad about yourself and lower your self-esteem.\nSome examples of common negative messages that people repeat over and over to themselves include: \"I am a jerk,\" \"I am a loser,\" \"I never do anything right,\" \"No one would ever like me,\" \"I am a klutz.\" Most people believe these messages, no matter how untrue or unreal they are. They come up immediately in the right circumstance, for instance if you get a wrong answer you think \"I am so stupid.\" They may include words like should, ought, or must. The messages tend to imagine the worst in everything, especially you, and they are hard to turn off or unlearn.\nYou may think these thoughts or give yourself these negative messages so often that you are hardly aware of them. Pay attention to them. Carry a small pad with you as you go about your daily routine for several days and jot down negative thoughts about yourself whenever you notice them. Some people say they notice more negative thinking when they are tired, sick, or dealing with a lot of stress. As you become aware of your negative thoughts, you may notice more and more of them.\nIt helps to take a closer look at your negative thought patterns to check out whether or not they are true. You may want a close friend or counselor to help you with this. When you are in a good mood and when you have a positive attitude about yourself, ask yourself the following questions about each negative thought you have noticed:\n- Is this message really true?\n- Would a person say this to another person? If not, why am I saying it to myself?\n- What do I get out of thinking this thought? If it makes me feel badly about myself, why not stop thinking it?\nYou could also ask someone else - someone who likes you and who you trust - if you should believe this thought about yourself. Often, just looking at a thought or situation in a new light helps.\nThe next step in this process is to develop positive statements you can say to yourself to replace these negative thoughts whenever you notice yourself thinking them. You can't think two thoughts at the same time. When you are thinking a positive thought about yourself, you can't be thinking a negative one. In developing these thoughts, use positive words like happy, peaceful, loving, enthusiastic, warm.\nAvoid using negative words such as worried, frightened, upset, tired, bored, not, never, can't. Don't make a statement like \"I am not going to worry any more.\" Instead say \"I focus on the positive\" or whatever feels right to you. Substitute \"it would be nice if\" for \"should.\" Always use the present tense, e.g., \"I am healthy,\" \"I am well,\" \"I am happy,\" \"I have a good job,\" as if the condition already exists. Use I, me, or your own name.\nYou can do this by folding a piece of paper in half the long way to make two columns. In one column write your negative thought and in the other column write a positive thought that contradicts the negative thought as shown on the next page.\nYou can work on changing your negative thoughts to positive ones by:\n- Replacing the negative thought with the positive one every time you realize you are thinking the negative thought.\n- Repeating your positive thought over and over to yourself, out loud whenever you get a chance and even sharing them with another person if possible.\n- Writing them over and over.\n- Making signs that say the positive thought, hanging them in places where you would see them often - like on your refrigerator door or on the mirror in your bathroom - and repeating the thought to yourself several times when you see it.\n- I am not worth anything.\n- I have never accomplished anything.\n- I always make mistakes.\n- I am a jerk.\n- I don't deserve a good life.\n- I am stupid.\n- I am a valuable person.\n- I have accomplished many things.\n- I do many things well.\n- I am a great person.\n- I deserve to be happy and healthy.\n- I am smart.\nIt helps to reinforce the positive thought if you repeat if over and over to yourself when you are deeply relaxed, like when you are doing a deep-breathing or relaxation exercise, or when you are just falling asleep or waking up.\nChanging the negative thoughts you have about yourself to positive ones takes time and persistence. If you use the following techniques consistently for four to six weeks, you will notice that you don't think these negative thoughts about yourself as much. If they recur at some other time, you can repeat these activities. Don't give up. You deserve to think good thoughts about yourself.\nPage last modified or reviewed by athealth on January 31, 2014", "scores": {"score": 4, "score_transform_1": 5, "score_transform_2": 5, "score_transform_3": 0}}
{"id": "1389", "text": "Who doesn’t love extra income? In addition to your primary job, an additional source of income can provide a blanket of security. This is especially beneficial in times of economic disarray like the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIf you’re a crypto investor, there is good news for you. You can add cryptocurrency staking as your source of passive income. It’s easy and guaranteed. This article will walk you through what is staking crypto, how you can do it, and much more.\nCrypto staking is the process of acquiring a certain number of coins and setting them aside in your wallet for a period of time, Our Cardano Staking Calculator helps you to estimate the rewards. A more traditional analogy for this would be depositing money in an interest savings account.\nStaking is similar to mining in the sense that it aids transaction validation. It doesn’t just offer a return on investment. Staking also acts as a support for the operation and security of the coin’s blockchain network.\nWith the advent of the Proof of Stake (PoS) verification protocol, an evolution of the Proof of Work (PoW) protocol, cryptocurrency staking gained popularity. PoS verification is a much more efficient solution to validate blocks, reducing the computational power required while maintaining decentralization. Cardano has been in the news a lot lately and labeled a “green” coin that uses a fraction of the energy of PoW coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Indeed, Ethereum 2.0 is trying to change to PoS as a fundamental reason.\nWhat is Cardano (ADA)?\nCardano is a public, open-source, decentralized PoS blockchain platform. It allows building and running smart contracts and other decentralized operations. The mastermind behind this third-generation platform is Charles Hoskinson, the co-founder of Ethereum. He recognized the limitations of PoW blockchain networks and began developing Cardano in 2015.\nThe primary cryptocurrency of Cardano is ADA, named after the 19th-century countess and English mathematician Ada Lovelace, who is also recognized as the first computer programmer. The Cardano platform was launched in 2017 and runs on PoS Ouroboros consensus protocol.\nIn a short time, Cardano has managed to become a highly sought-after cryptocurrency. With a current market cap of over $42 billion, it’s the fifth-largest cryptocurrency, according to CoinMarketCap.\nCardano (ADA) Staking\nMuch like any other cryptocurrency staking system, Cardano staking involves holding ADA for a period of time. Cardano’s Shelley upgrade introduced ADA staking rewards. Therefore, you not only get a return on investment, but you also assist the network in validating blocks on the protocol.\nCardano staking rewards are paid out every “epoch” or every five days. Selecting a stake pool to delegate to is required, and the beauty of the protocol architecture is such that you never share your private keys to do so. The scientific research and peer review is a critical component of the protocol engineering and in this case, you only share delegation keys, so your funds are never at risk in the delegation process. This is a stark contrast to the Ethereum 2.0 architecture and lack of scientific research and rigor that has caused a very recent “Key Management Issue” and the permanent loss of over $75 million Ether.\nAs mentioned, Cardano wallet addresses have separate keys for staking and spending. This means that if you’ve chosen to delegate your tokens to an existing staking pool, they will never leave your wallet. This is a reason many experts recommend not keeping your Cardano Ada coins on an exchange (including delegating with an exchange) because your wallet is stored in a centralized location and vulnerable to total loss from a hacker or key mismanagement. Remember the moniker, “not your keys (you don’t hold the keys yourself), not you’re your crypto”. Many experts recommend storing your Ada in wallets like Daedalus, Yoroi, or compatible hardware wallets so the individual holds the private keys and not the exchange.\nAlso, since there is no time period for tokens to be locked up, you can un-stake or re-stake them whenever you want. This is not true other PoS protocol where your funds are locked up for varying lengths of time. The Cardano staking protocol does take 4-5 epochs to pay out the first rewards payment, which may seem like the longest 15-20 days of your life, but rest assured the rewards come automatically after that, every epoch or five days. The stake pool you delegate to has no part in the payment of the rewards, it is handles very efficiently by the Cardano protocol.\nStaking as a Source of Passive Income\nWhen investors delegate their coins to existing ADA staking pools, they increase the pools’ chances of producing blocks. When blocks are produced, pools receive rewards which are then paid out to all contributors. These rewards are similar to interest in a savings account.\nAccording to Shidan Gouran, the founder of the Canadian merchant bank Gulf Pearl, investors should stake all their coins. There is no downside to participation, and investors can earn approximately 5.39 percent annually, this return percentage is built into the protocol. Every epoch the stake pool is assigned to produce blocks that’s based on their total stake. There is a slot lottery or “slottery” which is the mechanism that selects stake pools to make blocks every epoch. There is luck involved in every epoch or “slottery”, sometimes the protocol assigns a pool to produce 115% of blocks based on their stake, and another epoch it may be assigned to produce only 85%. But the Cardano protocol was engineered to pay out the average of 100% of the 5.39% annually.\nCompared to PoW based cryptocurrency mining, PoS based staking is a much more efficient and simplified process for investors to participate in the verification process. It involves no more risk than simply holding coins in a wallet. You can stake as much as you want, and the rewards are re-invested every epoch in your wallet automatically. The scientists, researchers, and engineers that designed and developed Cardano have really put huge amounts of effort to offer the best staking experience for those who delegate. It is no wonder 74% of all Ada in existence is staked, by far more than any other competitor coin out there. It is a stable, secure, and efficient way to earn passive income or rewards. Happy staking!", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

{"id": "1400", "text": "- Originally published on the Bartitsu.org site on Thursday, 21st February 2019\nSome sound advice from author J.G. Bohun Lynch, on the subject of street self-defence particularly from the boxer’s point of view.\nMr. Lynch’s recommended defence against a kicking attack is reminiscent of the so-called “secret style of boxing” developed by E.W. Barton-Wright and Pierre Vigny.\n“… may Mars who watches o’er\nThe half-stripped votaries of the sawdust floor,\nProtect thee still.”\nTHE practical uses of boxing for the purposes of self-defence in a street or other row are considerable, but sometimes just a little overrated. Everybody is accustomed to stories, actual or invented, telling of the big bully thrashed by a little boxer. Plenty of big bullies have been thrashed by little boxers: but in the interests of truth rather than of sentiment it is as well to add that where the bully is himself a boxer (and a boxer may be fairly competent without being very courageous) the little man will wish he was a big man. Weight and height and size must of themselves tell.\nBut then, most fortunately, these valuable qualities sometimes tell against their owner. A hulking ruffian with no knowledge of boxing, or—what is worse — a very little knowledge, will expend his strength in futile swings and wind-mill blows; he will get his feet mixed up; he will fight himself to a standstill. And all the while the other man, little or not as the case may be, will keep himself in reserve; looking on, so to say, an interested spectator. The mighty, blundering arms will pass and repass over his head; but by a little slipping and ducking on the part of a skilled opponent, these stupid blows will never land on any vital part. And then when the giant has worn himself out and stands panting and exhausted, his antagonist—still keeping admirably cool and collected—will carefully and systematically smash him.\nThat is the best side of street fighting, and it happens fairly often; but it is not always safe to reckon on the ruffian being a merely hulking one: he may be a good hand, for instance, at kicking with hob-nailed boots. And so to be useful in such emergencies the boxer has to alter his methods a little and be prepared for eventualities in no way connected with the Queensberry rules.\nOf course you will soon see whether the man who attacks you, or whom, for one reason or another, you feel called upon to attack, is going to fight fairly or not. In the former case all you have to do is to box as well as you can—as though you had entered for a competition with bare knuckles, but with certain modifications. In the latter you must keep a sharp look out and employ certain dodges, some of which will be indicated here, which are outside boxing.\nIn the first place, your position in any impromptu encounter should be rather different to that employed in ordinary sparring. You should stand more edgeways on towards your opponent, so as to give him as small a target as possible; and your attitude should be more cramped. You need not be afraid of this on the score of being tired the sooner, as such a fight is unlikely to last long. It is extremely important to guard every vital point rigidly. Your left shoulder should be held well up with the chin sunk below it. Your left arm should be more bent than is usual, your right elbow nearer the pit of your stomach, and the fist close to your face. Your feet will be in the same position as they ordinarily are.\nIt is an ungainly posture, and there will be none of the free and easy movement which is so essential to good boxing. But a fight in grim earnest cannot allow for the elegances of sport. You must protect yourself as best you can and damage your enemy as much as possible in the quickest time. In the case of a hooligan, you must do all in your power to disable him completely. Winning by a fair margin of points is hardly satisfactory in a street rough-and-tumble.\nIf your opponent stands up and boxes like a man, there is one particular blow you should try and land at once; and that is a straight left at his throat. You can occasionally bring it off when boxing with gloves if your antagonist leans his head back; otherwise the size of the glove mitigates its effect, and the blow lands partly on the top part of his chin and partly on the top of his breast-bone. With the bare fist, however, there is no difficulty about bringing the knuckles into undisturbed contact with the apple of the throat. Such a blow, well delivered, may virtually finish the encounter. The man who receives it gasps for breath, and probably staggers back, laying himself open to another blow given as you please—at the side of his jaw. It is extremely painful, this throat blow, and if you happen to receive it yourself you should cover up with both hands and get away for a moment or two if possible. In order to land it, you should feint with the left at your opponent’s head in order to make him throw it back to avoid the blow. Then step in a little closer and send the left home well under his chin.\nRemember always in a street fight a man who has some knowledge of boxing, but does not mean to use it fairly, will try and drive you up to a wall and hit your head back against it, if he can. The consequence of that is obvious; so always try to keep in the open. Do not waste time in hitting your man about the head if he ducks low: it will not hurt him, and you may damage your knuckles. In the same way, unless he has no coat or waistcoat on, be chary of hitting him in the body. Buttons or a watch chain may do considerable damage to your knuckles, especially when repeatedly hit. Of course you must not leave his body alone—particularly if the man is a fat or a flabby one. But make sure that when you do hit him there that the blow is a really hard one, carefully timed. With the hooligan type you should make a point of avoiding his mouth. Dangerous cases of blood-poisoning have resulted from knuckles cut on the teeth of this sort of man. Aim for his jaw, his throat, and his temples in particular.\nWith the man who fights “all in,” as the saying goes, who will employ any means of hurting you from half a brick to a knee in your stomach, you must be more vigilant. This kind of man will often charge with his head down, trying to butt the wind out of you. The ordinary boxer will naturally regard this as a first-class opportunity for an upper cut. So it is. But you need something much more damaging than that. It is not the slightest good being quixotic on such an occasion. You must stop the man as best you may. The thing to do in this instance is to wait for him, and as he comes in bring your right leg up in a level with the left, and lift your knee with all your power into his face. Your fists should then get a chance of completing the good work in the next second. By the same mark, never lower your own head in case your opponent may remember his knees.\nThen there is the ruffian who tries to kick your shins. That is easily stopped if you can keep a cool head, and, as before, wait for him. Lift your foot off the ground six inches or so, and the fellow’s own shin will come into violent contact with the toe of your boot. More dangerous is he who pretends to fight with his fists and suddenly kicks out sideways at your stomach. Of course the most serious injuries may be caused in that way: but if you are quick enough—and the best of boxing is that it makes you alert to perceive this sort of thing as well as the fair manoeuvres of the ring—if you are quick enough then you can step back half a pace, snatch your opponent’s leg as it . rises, and by an upward jerk throw him down.\nIn any sort of street fight, however, do not be led into wrestling unless you are an expert at it; and keep to long range hitting, waiting your chance for a punishing blow. Little blows are of no use. It is far better to hit seldom and with all your might.\nWith the type of man already referred to who stops at nothing, who stoops to anything, it never does to run any risks at all. If, for example, you get your head into “chancery”—an expression now obsolete as regards boxing—you are likely to be severely handled. The origin of the phrase is fairly obvious. Having once got into actual Chancery there is considerable difficulty in getting out again. Getting your head into chancery is caused by ducking too low past your opponent’s left, so that he can bring his arm back quickly and hold your head beneath it. True that by this means he cannot hurt you much in the ordinary way as your face is protected by his body, and your left will be free to guard your own: but he may throw you badly, or he may inflict much punishment by kidney blows.\nThe best way to get out of chancery is to hit at your opponent’s “mark” with your left as hard as you can, at the same time getting your left heel behind his. It is not the least use pulling with your head: but if you are strong enough you may be able to loosen your antagonist’s grasp by forcing up his left arm with your right hand. But in street fighting you should make it a rule never to get near enough to your opponent to allow the possibility of chancery. In boxing, to grip a man’s head under your arm is just like any other form of holding—a matter to be dealt with instantly by the referee.\nThere is another kind of antagonist more frequently to be met with than any other in a street row, and that is the drunken man. He may be by practice a fair boxer or no boxer at all, or a “kick and half-brick” man. But when drunk—all types when thoroughly drunk have this in common—it is extremely difficult to hurt him. His sensibilities are deadened. His Dutch courage is heroic; and though it is but Dutch courage it serves its purpose. Men like this are easy enough to knock down as a rule, for the simple reason that standing at all is a considerable trouble to them. But unless they are very far gone in drink they will rise, little the worse for the fall, and make for you again. It is always disgusting to hit a drunken man, but it frequently has to be done—and it is as well to remember how difficult it is to make any impression on him.", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}

The caller may already know some information about you and use that to get you to give them more. It is important to keep your guard up; if the caller starts asking for personal information or making you feel a sense of urgency, these are red flags that you’re on the phone with a scammer.\nThe best practice when it comes to dealing with unexpected phone calls is not to answer any phone calls from numbers you do not recognize.

The perpetrators typically target consumers via social media and convince them to share their checking account information in exchange for some type of a kickback – usually in the form of a counterfeit check remotely deposited into their account, of which the consumer is allowed to keep a portion of the funds. However, the fraudster often removes all of the funds before the bank determines that the check is counterfeit. Fraudsters may also convince the victim to provide them with their debit card number, along with their PIN. The consumer is instructed to report the card as lost or stolen.\nCard-cracking is a national problem. Many of the victims do not understand they are facilitating a crime in which they could receive up to 30 years in prison for their participation. In addition to being charged as an accomplice to a crime, they are also at risk of having their own money stolen from their accounts and having unauthorized purchases made with their debit cards.

{"id": "1411", "text": "For Belmont High School Head Coach Brian Bisceglia-Kane, Tuesday’s home game against Lexington High was an exciting one, but “it’s just a regular-season game.”\nBut the match, played on Seniors Night at Harris Field, Oct. 21, should be placed in the “signature win” column as the Marauders struck twice early and once late to defeat the one-loss Minutemen – ranked 12th for the past two weeks in the Boston Globe poll – by a 3-2 scoreline.\nThe win ups the Marauders record to 11-3-2 with two games left in the season; away at Winchester on Saturday, Oct. 25 and a home game on Monday, Oct. 27 vs. non-league Pentucket.\n“Under the lights, both teams wanted this and I was proud of their effort tonight. I really like how they came out with a lot of effort and athleticism against Lexington,” said Bisceglia-Kane.\n“This was a good measuring stick for the playoffs. Lexington’s a [Division] 1 team and ranked and we weren’t so hopefully this helps their confidence,” he said.\nAfter a celebration honoring the team’s seniors and before parents, family and a loud cheering section, Belmont came out like a whirlwind, out-muscled and outplayed the Minuteman which resulted in the best possible start. At the kickoff, Belmont drove the ball down the right side where leading scorer, Charlie Frigo, picked up the ball 18 meters out, pivoted that left a defenders looking and fired the ball past Minuteman’s Carter Hochman after a mere 36 seconds.\nBefore the rowdy fans could find their seats, Frigo netted his brace knocking in a cross from Sami Beluadi to give Belmont a 2-0 lead after only three-and-a-half minutes.\nBut you don’t get to 12 wins out of 14 games without being somewhat good playing the game and Lexington got its mojo going by winning the battle in the midfield by out running the Marauders to the ball and connecting on some sharp combination passing. Some slick passing in the box allowed Henry Troop to one-time the ball by Belmont goalkeeper Peter Berens with seven minutes to go in the first to leave the Minutemen trailing by one at the half.\nLexington would tie the game eight minutes into the second half as defender Alfred Joseph came up from the back to take a short pass from Lewis Mustoe and slipped the ball just under a diving Berens.\nWith blood in the water, the Minutemen continued its assault only to be thawed by Berens twice including a sliding block at the penalty spot.\nAt the 30 minute mark with a tie on the board, the game became a grind-it-out affair with much of the action taking place between the goal areas with few solid chances for either side.\nThen, against the run of play, Belmont took the lead in the simplest of ways.\nSenior forward Luke Gallagher outpaced the Lexington midfielder to take a long clearing pass down the right wing. He quickly passed the ball to the top of the box where a fast-closing Daron Hamparian controlled the ball and shot between the center and right backs and passing a flat-footed Hochman with 13 minutes remaining.\n“Sometimes the team is so technically sound that they don’t play a little messier. That [goal] was just a vertical pass [Gallagher] won and passed to [Hamparian], a quick pass and a shot,” said Bisceglia-Kane. “Hopefully we can do this a little more because we tend to be a little too cute with the ball.”\nWith the exception of a pair of corner kicks which did not reach Berens, Belmont eased to the win.\n“The proudest moment for me was when we were let up the lead but then responded,” said Bisceglia-Kane.\n“That’s what you will have to do. There will be moments in the regular season and, hopefully not, but most likely in the playoffs when you need to come back in a game,” he said.\n“I always tell the guys they need to play for one another. If you are playing for yourself, you’re never going to be playing your hardest. But when you’re playing for each other that’s when you feel like you’re playing as a team,” said Bisceglia-Kane.\nGirls’ soccer returns to playoffs with shutout over Minutemen\nThe members of the Belmont High Girls’ Soccer team were screaming their collective heads off as their bus passed by Harris Field as the boys’ soccer team was about to kick off with their match with Lexington.\nThe yelling fest – an ongoing tradition for Belmont’s girls’ squads – meant only one thing: the team had won their away match vs Lexington; and with it, a return to the post-season for the Marauders (9-5-2).\nWith a first-half goal by senior Sophia Eschenbach-Smith – her second important goal in three games – and the stellar work by the three back line defenders that helped goalkeeper Linda Herlihy to her seventh shutout in the 1-0 victory.\n“It was a really good team win and we worked really hard,” said Eschenbach-Smith. “I hope we can keep up the momentum as we are now in the playoffs.”\nEschenbach-Smith scored Belmont’s lone goal in the Marauders’ 1-1 home tie against 15th ranked and league leader Arlington High a week earlier.\nThe win was payback for a 5-0 home loss to the Minutemen on Sept. 24.\n“Today we came out with a real purpose. We needed the one point to get into the tournament. We talked a lot about that and the kids really worked hard and came out fired up,” said Paul Graham, the team’s long-time head coach, who missed last season’s playoffs after a two decade run.\n“We played playoff soccer tonight,” said Graham, whose victory total now stands at 298.\nEschenbach Smith scored from a pass from Julia Cella after getting past a defender and burying a left foot shot 15 minutes into the game.\nThen Graham allowed Herlihy and his back line to dictate the pace of the game.\n“Our defense was tremendous,” said Graham, saying that freshman Natalie Marcus-Bauer, who now starts in the Marauders’ defense with senior leader center back Lucia Guzikowski and Elizabeth Ferrante, “who had her best game” and naming her the Player of the Match.\nWith his two outside midfielders – Katrina Rokosz and Elizabeth Ferrante – coming back to cover the wide spaces, “we had five players taking on their two forwards.” When the Minutemen did have opportunities to score, Herlihy was there to crush those chances.\n“I have to thank my defenders. They do a great job every game. If I get a shutout, it’s a team shutout,” said Herlihy.", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

I was skeptical, because for taxpayers to recover all their money meant that GM would have to be valued at about $80 billion, which seemed unrealistic to me.\nGM just reported a 2010 profit of $4.7 billion, so their recovery after their government bailout is on track. The day after reporting that profit, GM stock is selling for $34 a share, making the market capitalization of GM about $51 billion.\nGM’s stock would have to rise to more than $50 a share for the taxpayers to recover President Obama’s “investment” in GM.

But the president did say that last year, prior to GM’s initial public offering.

Many homeowners turn to the do-it-yourself cleaning methods, believing it is quick easy fix. While this maybe true, a majority of drain cleaners may do more harm than good.\nIneffective & Toxic Chemicals\nThe classic remedy of boiling water & using store bought cleaners may resolve a small clog, but they are ineffective for substantial clogs & could be dangerous. Drain cleaners often use very harsh chemicals that are not only corrosive but even toxic. After you’ve poured the solution down the drain the chemicals can become airborne causing anyone close to ingest the toxins.\nDamage to Pipes\nSome drain cleaners contain a high concentration of hydrochloric acid. Hydrochloric acid is an extremely corrosive chemical that can be harmful to humans & animals. While it does break down & remediate the clog, it eats away at your pipes & septic system. Highly acidic drain cleaners kill important bacteria present in the septic system. These bacteria break down the waste stuck in drains, preventing clogs from occurring in the first place.\nIt’s difficult to know exactly what is wring with your plumbing when a clog occurs.

{"id": "1495", "text": "The last Bootcamp article was all about career planning, and continuing your education is definitely a part of that — a big part — but the topic certainly deserves its own bootcamp instalment. So this month’s instalment of our “Success4U in Canada Bootcamp” is Part 4: Lifelong learning, and what you need to know about upgrading your education credentials in Canada. (Catch up on the first three instalments online here.\nPart 4: Lifelong learning\nThinking of going back to school to further your education or add a Canadian credential to your resumé? Have you been told you’ll have to retrain to get licensed in your field in Canada? Or are you just one of those types of people that like to keep improving and learning? Let’s look at the why, what, where and how of learning in Canada.\n1. Why keep learning?\nThere are many good reasons why newcomers should consider some more education now that they are in Canada, not the least of which are the benefits of personal learning and growth. Or perhaps they want to retrain for a whole new career and get an entirely new degree. But for immigrants who want to find work in their existing field now that they’re in Canada, there are three reasons why continuing your education is not only smart, but often even necessary.\n- Upgrade their communication/English and soft skills to a higher level (the importance of continuing to improve your English and soft skills was discussed in Bootcamp Parts 1 and 2).\n- Get a Canadian credential on their resumé to show they have knowledge and experience in their (unlicensed) field in the Canadian context.\n- Upgrade their skills and take exams to fulfill requirements of their licensed profession.\nPhil Schalm, associate director, University of Toronto’s School of Continuing Education, says these are the three most common scenarios for newcomers looking to go back to school. “People come to us for a particular kind of career boost; a means of accelerating their careers,” he explains.\nMany of the newcomers that Schalm sees already have degrees — often more than one — and just want something Canadian to wrap around their international experience. “It’s not another degree they need, but rather something Canadian they can blanket around their existing degree, and giving it some heightened credibility in Canada,” he says, adding that it helps to be from a prestigious institution.\nAnd, in terms of licensed professions, it’s often not a choice, but a requirement to get such additional Canadian-specific training, before they can get certified and practised in their field. About 20 per cent of Canadian jobs are in regulated occupations — everything from pharmacy, medicine, law and architecture to other professions, including certain trades — (find out if yours is one of them under the “Explore Careers” section of jobbank.gc.ca).\nA non-regulated occupation, on the other hand, is a job for which there is no restriction on practice or legal requirement for licences, certificates or registration. But that doesn’t mean that a Canadian employer won’t seek out candidates who possess certain experience, skills or training.\nSchalm adds that even such unlicensed professional areas might have specific associations or institutes that offer optional certification, such as the Canadian Risk Management (CRM) designation. “This can provide that key to employment,” Schalm says. “Otherwise, it’s harder to demonstrate your qualifications to employers, especially small and medium-sized business employers who don’t have the resources to check on international credentials.”\n2. What to learn\nSo how do you find out what program to take or what school to attend?\nWell, if you’ve determined your profession is licensed after your initial research, you can find the information you need on upgrading from the regulatory body that governs your profession in your province. For example, an internationally trained accountant in Toronto could approach the Chartered Professional Accountants of Ontario (its website even has a tab for the “internationally educated” in the main navigation bar!).\nSchalm says the regulatory body for licensed professions is the place to start. “For licensed professions, a newcomer’s first step is always to reach out to the provincial body,” he says. “You may waste your time if you go to another agency first.”\nThe regulatory body will offer guidance on:\n- having your international credentials assessed\n- determining what kind of training or courses you will need to take\n- if they don’t offer training themselves, connecting you with schools who do or any existing immigrant bridging programs in your field\n- explaining what examinations and fees are required before you can get your Canadian licence\nMany newcomers are often surprised by how much they have to do in order to be licensed in Canada, and the process for some professions can take years and thousands of dollars. But you know what steps you have to take.\nThe situation becomes a little less clear for newcomers in unlicensed professions, say, business, IT or marketing. For immigrants in such fields, a good first step for information is an immigrant settlement or career counselling agency. Often, universities and colleges will have career resource centres you can visit, too. Although note that information from these sources will often be focused on their own program offerings.\n“Too often, we’ve not communicated effectively to people who are immigrating to Canada in terms of helping them analyze exactly what they need [in terms of training],” says Schalm. “Very often, someone will come to Canada, and can’t differentiate what is offered by a private training college/agency versus a community college or university. And they spend a lot of time and money on programs before they eventually find the right program. That’s painful.”\nSchalm says it’s critical to do plenty of research and planning, because ultimately the onus is on you to decide what to study or whether to further your education at all.\nHowever, your research should also extend to the demand for your profession in Canada and in your region specifically. Geneviève Beaupré and Susan Qadeer, our magazine’s “Higher Learning” columnists, explain: “Most college programs and some university programs are linked to specific careers. But this does not mean that chances of employment in the field are currently good or that they will be favourable in the near future. The job prospects linked to specific studies need to be part of your research. You will want to read labour market information and newspapers, and discuss this with those who hire and work in the field. Provinces and territories vary in their needs and if you would consider moving to another part of Canada, this may increase your options.”\n3. Where to learn\nWhere you study is intrinsically tied to what you are studying and where you are physically located. Immigrants in licensed professions will often have a required program and school to attend, while those in unlicensed professions will have more freedom to choose.\nAs Schalm notes above, however, newcomers sometimes waste time and money taking the wrong program or going to the wrong school, with little benefit. It’s important to understand the different types of educational choices available in Canada and what they mean. Here is a rundown:\n- Universities offer bachelor’s, master’s and PhDs in many fields such as arts, education, medicine, etc. Immigrant bridging programs may also be available in certain fields.\n- Colleges or technical institutes offer bachelor’s degrees and university transfer programs, but also occupation-oriented certificates and diplomas. Immigrant bridging programs may also be available in certain fields.\n- Private institutions offer short-term certificate and diploma programs that are occupation specific, for example, medical lab technicians and hairdressing. Do plenty of research on private institutes and check if they are accredited by the province.\n- Professional associations in specialized fields such as accounting may have training through their own programs.\n- Immigrant settlement agencies and other organizations may offer bridging and occupational programs to help transition newcomers into their field.\nBeaupré and Qadeer further note that you don’t necessarily have to take a full degree or diploma program. “Sometimes a course or two is sufficient to make a difference. Taking a few key courses could ease the way in many fields where Canadian knowledge is important, including finance, hospitality, science and technology. A carefully chosen part-time course or two can provide you with a quick overview of a particular field. This is not a big investment of time or money, and it may be very beneficial.\n“If you are currently unemployed, then a longer program of study may make some sense. Some programs may also offer work placements, providing opportunities to network and to add Canadian experience to your resumé.”\n4. How to learn\nSo, with pencil and paper in hand, what are some of the important things you should understand about approaching your studies in Canada? Here are seven tips for successfully approaching school in Canada:\n- Approach your learning with an open mind. You may have learned things differently in your country of origin, so be open to new methods and ways of thinking.\n- It’s important to participate in the classroom. Studies show that participating in class helps you better learn the material. Avoid the two extremes: disappearing in the background or monopolizing class time.\n- Be prepared for teamwork or group assignments. Make the best of who you end up with and build on each other’s strengths. Assign roles to each other to work on things separately or work on things more collaboratively, but you will be marked as a team.\n- If you disagree with a fellow student or teacher, or they disagree with you, remember not to take things personally. Universities and colleges are places for dialogue and differing opinions will surely surface.\n- If you’re taking an online or distance education course, treat it with the seriousness you would an in-person class. Schedule study time on a regular basis and ensure you meet assignment deadlines.\n- Make use of resources available to learn the material, whether it’s meeting with a professor during office hours, using the library, getting private tutoring or finding a study buddy.\n- Use the opportunity to network and meet people. Instructors are sometimes working professionals who are teaching part time, or you might meet working professionals in your course there for some professional development.

City of Santa Monica\n|105 Cal.Rptr.2d 802,88 Cal.App.4th 451\n|13 March 2001\n|California Court of Appeals\n|COALITION ADVOCATING LEGAL HOUSING OPTIONS et al, Plaintiffs and Appellants, v. CITY OF SANTA MONICA, Defendant and Respondent.\nThis lawsuit, brought by the Coalition Advocating Legal Housing Options and Lou Moench, challenges the constitutionality of a Santa Monica zoning ordinance. The ordinance allows the creation of \"second units\" in single-family residential zones, but only if the person occupying the second unit is the property owner or his/her dependent, or a caregiver for the property owner or dependent. Since the ordinance's distinction among permissible users of second units violates both privacy and equal protection rights under established constitutional principles, the judgment upholding the ordinance must be reversed.\nA second unit is an attached or detached unit that provides complete independent living facilities for one or more persons. The zoning ordinance under review was passed because of a state law encouraging local agencies to permit the creation of second units in single- and multiple-family zones. The statute authorizes such local ordinances, and indeed requires local agencies to permit second units meeting state-set standards unless the locality either (1) passes its own ordinance providing for such units which may have requirements stricter than the state standards, or (2) totally precludes them in single-family or multiple-family zoned areas. (Govt.Code, § 65852.2.) But a locality cannot totally preclude second units unless its ordinance contains findings that the ban is justified by specific adverse impacts on the public health, safety and welfare that would result from allowing second units. (Id. at subd. (c).)\nThe state's statute on second units was originally enacted in 1982, with legislative findings that, inter alia, there was a tremendous unmet need for new housing and many benefits associated with creation of second-family residential units on existing single-family lots. These included providing a cost-effective means of serving development of housing through use of existing infrastructures, providing relatively affordable housing without public subsidy, providing a means for purchasers to meet payments on high interest loans, and providing security for homeowners. (Stats. 1982, ch. 1440, § 1.)\nThe statute was amended in 1994. The amendment's legislative history indicates that local governments had responded to the existing law either by embracing second units as a source of affordable housing, or by discouraging their creation through complicated and expensive application procedures or other means. (Assem. Com. on Housing & Community Development, Analysis of A.B. 3198 (1993-1994 Sess.) as amended May 4, 1994, p. 4.) The amendment imposed new requirements on local jurisdictions, including limits on the size and parking requirements that could be imposed for second units. (Govt.Code, § 65852.2, subds. (d) & (e).) It also specifically declared the Legislature's intent that \"any second-unit ordinances adopted by local agencies have the effect of providing for the creation of second units,\" and that provisions of such ordinances \"are not so arbitrary, excessive, or burdensome so as to unreasonably restrict the ability of homeowners to create second units in zones in which they are authorized by local ordinance.\" (Govt. Code, § 65852.150.)\nThe City of Santa Monica (the City) received its first application for a second unit in June 1996, 13 years after the initial state law went into effect. Under state law, the City then had 120 days to pass its own ordinance, either providing for creation of second units or totally precluding them. Alternatively, the City would be required to grant a permit for the second unit if the application complied with state statutory requirements. (Govt.Code, § 65852.2, subd. (b)(1).)\nThe staff of the City Council recommended that the Council direct the staff to prepare an ordinance creating local standards regulating second units. The staffs report advised that the City's then-current prohibition on second units in R-l single family districts \"does not meet the requirements of State law.\"1 The report said that the staff did not believe that specific findings justifying a prohibition could be made.2 The staffs report also included a copy of a 1990 publication from the State Department of Housing and Community Development, indicating that a local ordinance limiting occupancy to persons related to the owner would be susceptible to legal challenge.\nThe Council held a public hearing on August 13, 1996, and accepted the staffs recommendation, and directed staff to prepare an ordinance regulating\nsecond units. The staff did so, and presented it to the Council at its meeting on September 24, 1996, again stating its view that there was not sufficient evidence to adopt the findings necessary for a ban of second units. The Planning Commission had also voted unanimously to recommend an ordinance legalizing second-unit creation in 1 zones.\nSome 24 members of the public spoke at the September hearing, the majority opposing the proposal and supporting a ban on second units. The speakers opined that second units would mean more congestion, air pollution, noise, traffic, and on-street parking; would add to the burden on the water supply, trash disposal, and schools; and would divert police resources from other areas to handle the increased crime in R-l neighborhoods.\nAfter discussion, the Council rejected the staffs recommendation and instructed the staff to prepare new recommendations for adoption of an ordinance that would\nprohibit rental units in the R-l area, with the appropriate findings. The staff was also asked to evaluate whether any limited hardship exceptions should be included in such an ordinance.\nThe Council held a hearing on October 8, 1996, on a revised ordinance. The proposed ordinance prohibited second units in R-l districts, with a limited exception for second units used for the owner's child or parent in cases of substantial hardship. There were 20 speakers, and again most opposed second units. Two speakers asked for a modification to expand the exception to include relatives and household help.\nAfter discussion, the Council voted four to three to adopt Interim Ordinance 1866, allowing second units only for use by dependents/caregivers rather than only parent/child, with a requirement for a demonstration of substantial hardship and a specific prohibition against renting the unit. The following month the ordinance was extended for 18 months.\nA similar interim ordinance (Ordinance No.1916) was introduced and passed four to three on June 9, 1998. It eliminated the hardship requirement, permitting second units intended and used solely for occupancy by dependents or caregivers. The ordinance also contained regulations governing lot size, density, maximum and minimum unit size, parcel coverage, parking requirements, design standards and other requirements for second units.\nBefore the scheduled expiration in June 1999 of Interim Ordinance No.1916, the Planning Commission recommended that the Council take a different approach to second units by controlling them through either density or concentration regulations. At the Council's meeting on April 27, 1999, the staff\npresented alternative ordinances for the Council's consideration, one to extend the interim ordinance temporarily, and the other to enact the same standards permanently. The staff recommended that the Council extend the interim ordinance to allow the opportunity to explore the alternatives proposed by the Planning Commission.\nAgain, most of the speakers at the Council's meeting opposed second units, and the Council adopted the permanent ordinance (Ordinance No.1942) on May 11, 1999, by a five to two vote.3\nMeanwhile, in September 1998, shortly after the adoption of Interim Ordinance No.1916, the Coalition and Moench, a member of the Coalition and former member of the Planning Commission, filed a petition for writ of mandate. The petition sought a writ requiring the City Council to cease enforcement of the dependent/caregiver provision of Ordinance No.1916 or to adopt an ordinance eliminating it, and to process otherwise eligible permit applications without regard to intent or use of the second unit. After the trial court indicated that alternative forms of relief might be more appropriate, the petition was amended to add a claim for declaratory and injunctive relief. The petition was later deemed amended so as to challenge the permanent ordinance (Ordinance No.1942) upon its enactment.\nThe matter was heard on July 9, 1999, after filing of supplemental papers, including lengthy transcripts of the public hearings. After brief oral argument, the court took the matter under submission, and a few days later issued a minute order denying the petition, without analysis.\nThis appeal followed.\nA. The municipal affairs doctrine does not apply.\nThe City argues as a preliminary matter that, as a charter city, it is not required to comply with the state statute on second units, under the \"municipal affairs\"\ndoctrine. That doctrine says that a charter city's ordinances relating to purely municipal affairs prevail over state laws on the same subject.\nThe City is...\nTo continue readingRequest your trial", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}
{"id": "1531", "text": "Proper storage can keep birdseed fresh and nutritious for longer, ensuring that backyard birds have the very best to eat. Whether you need to store birdseed from a great sale, to stock up for winter or just find it convenient to have plenty of seed on hand, it must be stored well to make the most of every seed so none is lost or wasted.\nWhy Proper Storage Matters\nBirdseed must be stored carefully or it can be subject to a wide variety of problems. Mice, rats, raccoons or other animals can gorge themselves on seed that is easily accessible, while insects and other pests may infest the seed and make it unfit for birds to eat. If seed gets damp, it will clump, fester and mold, which can make birds sick. Old seed loses nutritional value and is not as healthy for birds, and if seed is in very poor condition, birds may not eat it at all and will simply move on to other food sources, abandoning a backyard feeding station. By properly storing seed, however, these problems can be avoided and birds will always have safe, nutritious treats to enjoy.\nProperly Storing Seed\nStoring birdseed to keep it fresh, safe and nutritious isn't hard, and only takes three simple steps…\nChoose the Proper Container\nBirdseed containers should be durable, made of galvanized metal or thick plastic with rounded corners to resist chewing by persistent rodents. While airtight seals are not necessary, the covers should be firm enough to keep pests away from the seed and to keep water out of the storage container. The covers should also fit tightly enough that they cannot be worked loose by industrious pests or blown off by a storm.\nThe size of the storage container should suit the amount of seed you have to store, so no seed is left unprotected. Very large, bulk bags of seed will require larger containers, while smaller, more expensive or less frequently used seed may fit into smaller bins or thick plastic bags. At the same time, consider how heavy the full container will be, and be sure it can still be lifted or moved if necessary, even when filled. Several smaller containers can also be used in place of one large one.\nPosition Containers Conveniently\nContainers should be kept in a dry, cool, safe location such as inside a garage or garden shed, which can provide another layer of protection from pests and poor weather. Positioning heavier containers close to feeding stations will make it easier to refill feeders, and they should be easy to access in all types of weather. Avoid placing containers where pets may bother them, or where they will be in the way of other outdoor activities such as blocking garden tools or obstructing a path.\nOnce seed is properly stored, it is important to inspect it regularly to be sure the containers are doing their job. Sift through seed to check for signs of moisture, insects or mold, and check around the container as well for evidence of raiding pests. Rotate seed so the oldest supply is used first, and thoroughly wash and disinfect the containers at least once or twice a year to keep them safe for storing seed.\nStoring seed well is more than just keeping it in a convenient location – it also keeps seed fresh and nutritious for months, allowing birders to easily stock up and never worry about their backyard birds missing a meal.", "scores": {"score": 3, "score_transform_1": 5, "score_transform_2": 5, "score_transform_3": 0}}

{"id": "1567", "text": "Solid-state electromagnetic heterodyning has been central to computing and telecommunications. Heterodyning enables frequency shifting to optimise signal transmission over long distances, though has thus far lacked remote targeting ability. A method capable of remote, focal heterodyning in liquid materials would enable concepts such as liquid computation and telecommunications to be developed.\nA long-standing goal in biomedicine has been to non-invasively and focally modulate and record electrophysiological signals at depth. To these ends, it would be advantageous to harness the focusing ability of acoustics due to their smaller wavelengths compared to electric fields, whilst still interacting with the body in terms of well understood electrical interactions. This combination of advantages led us to investigate the acoustoelectric effect, initially detected by Herzfeld and Rock  who noted that the conductivity of saline solution was modulated via acoustic waves. The application of an ultrasonic field to an electrolyte changes the ion density and mobility periodically thereby changing the conductivity at the ultrasound frequency . They noticed that this conductivity modulation, when a constant current is present, elicits and potential change. Recently, several studies have used this theoretical foundation and the lead-field reciprocal principle to estimate the current density distribution in tissues using ultrasound and surface electric potential recording aka ultrasound current source density imaging [3, 4].\nOur recent article in Nature Communications Physics, predicts acoustoelectric heterodyning via mathematical and computational field modelling, accounting for the vector nature of the electrolytic acoustoelectric interaction. We then experimentally validate this by applying a focal acoustic field to an electric field in electrolytes, demonstrating that we can mechanically heterodyne the electric field at just the focal area of the ultrasound, inducing new electric field components that oscillate at the sum and difference frequencies of the applied fields.\nThe heterodyned electric field has a unique shape dependent on the relative applied fields' orientation as predicted by simulation and proven through experimental measurement. We found that when the electric field was applied in parallel with the direction of the acoustic field propagation, the generated electric field had a three-dimensional topology with a concentric ring dipole in the radial direction and a periodic linear multipole in the axial direction (relative to the acoustic field propagation) with the ultrasound wavelength. When the electric field was applied perpendicular to the direction of acoustic field propagation it changed the topology and strength of the generated electric field. Specifically, the concentric ring geometry in the radial direction changed to a dipole. Furthermore, the amplitude of the generated electric field was four times larger when the acoustic and electric fields were aligned, compared to when they were perpendicular.\nThese fundamental qualities of the acoustoelectric effect, enable us to encode and decode electric fields at depth with improved amplitudes and topological accuracy. To encode a signal at a focal location we apply an electric field at a small difference frequency from the acoustic frequency, to produce a low frequency field based on the difference between the two applied fields at the remote focal area of the acoustic source. To decode an electric signal that is generated at depth, a complex ionic current signal in the target location is focally mixed with a sinusoidal acoustic signal via the acoustoelectric effect to generate a detectable electric signal with the original information modulated up to the acoustic frequency (see Fig 3.). The electric potential of the modulated signal is recorded and computationally demodulated to recover the original signal via in-phase and quadrature (IQ) demodulation. In IQ demodulation, the signal is multiplied by two sinusoidal waveforms at the known frequency and a phase difference. The resultant signals are low pass filtered (LPF) to yield the signal and the phase shifted signal from which the instantaneous amplitude and phase of the original signal are recovered.\nGiven the broad use of electrostatic focusing lenses , the potential translational prospects for acoustically controlled electric field lenses are exciting. Acoustoelectric heterodyning could enable non-invasive focal modulation and recording of electrophysiological signals at depth and future studies in animal models will be able to test the feasibility of such an approach. These unique properties of the electromechanical interaction open translational avenues in electrochemistry, bioelectronics, and medicine.\nFor more information read our article, and don't forget to also see the supplementary material which gives a more in depth mathematical proof, artefact study and more.\n F.

{"id": "1580", "text": "Editor’s Note: This article was written before news broke that a station similar to the one described was hit with a surge of Covid cases. It reinforces Willy’s assertion that the policies governing Covid protocols, even in Antarctica, are anti-science and lacking of any semblance of common sense.\nIn October of 2021, I deployed to McMurdo Station, Antarctica for the second time. Each austral summer, McMurdo Station becomes home to about 1,000 eclectic and wonderful people who are the workforce behind the National Science Foundation’s (NSF) United States Antarctic Program (USAP), which facilitates research with a logistical prowess on par with that of the US military.\nDespite McMurdo’s remoteness and lack of the usual American amenities, there is normally a rich community life on this strange island. The community organizes yoga classes, cafes, art galleries, music festivals, craft fairs, holiday parties, and more. I was enamored by this social-scape during my first visit in 2017, but in 2021 community life at McMurdo has been unrecognizable due to the NSF’s Covid policies for the Antarctic.\nWhile USAP research stations are some of the only populations in the world with zero Covid, residents of these stations live under stricter Covid precautions than many Western cities during peak waves of infection.\nIn the time between my two Antarctic deployments, I received a Master of Public Health degree from Columbia University’s Mailman School of Public Health. There, I learned the importance of evidence-based public health interventions, of carefully analyzing health risks, of targeting interventions based on those risks, and of always considering unintended negative consequences.\nSo, throughout the pandemic, I have been baffled to see many public health professionals and scientific institutions advocate for broad, extreme, and unprecedented measures without supporting evidence. The NSF’s scientifically inconsistent Covid policies for Antarctica are the most prominent examples of this fallacy I have now experienced.\nThe NSF formulated these polices early in the pandemic. Given the remote and resource-limited nature of Antarctica, the NSF recognized that Covid outbreaks in the intimate station populations would spread quickly and might easily overwhelm clinical capacities. And with aerial medical evacuation dangerously unreliable, the NSF smartly formulated policies to prevent Covid from reaching Antarctica and to mitigate its impact in case it did.\nThe policies begin with medical screening for health risks, which include known Covid risk factors. Deployers to McMurdo travel as cohorts that isolate in hotel rooms for three days, confirm a negative PCR test result, then fly on a private, direct flight to Christchurch, New Zealand.\nChristian-Driven America-First Precious Metals.\nBefore markets collapse, the smart play is to move wealth or retirement to precious metals. Contact Genesis Gold now to make it happen smoothly with no hassles from a group driven by fellowship.\nWhen the first cohorts of the summer season arrived in September, there had been zero Covid cases on the entire South Island for almost a year. PCR tests and screenings for symptoms took place on arrival, days three, seven, and 12 during 14 days of strict isolation in Christchurch’s proven and effective “managed isolation and quarantine” (MIQ) facilities. US and Royal New Zealand Air Force aircrews subjected to the same isolation procedures as USAP cohorts then flew them to “the ice”. While at great expense, these sound, evidence-based procedures have to-date successfully kept Covid out of all USAP stations.\nIt is after arriving to Antarctica where these policies go awry. Following passenger plane arrivals of Covid-free cohorts, the entire receiving station population must wear masks, social distance, and adhere to inconsistently and arbitrarily reduced capacities in public and recreational spaces for one week.\nIn October a new passenger plane arrived about every five days, protracting restrictions to the entire month. We were relegated to constant face coverings where we lived and worked and a loss of any social or recreational activities that usually preside at McMurdo Station – all in the absence of Covid. Even the most ardent mask supporters had become “anti-maskers”.\nBeyond low morale, the policies contribute to immense operational and safety setbacks. The station population this season is small – around 500 – and has been slowly dwindling in response to the strict policies and a vaccine mandate that took effect one week after my cohort (with an 85% vaccination rate) arrived. Multiple written assurances that those who were non-vaccinated would not be medically disqualified, were reversed. Several workers in critical departments refused the vaccine and were sent home, many others quit due to the other extreme policies. Nearly all departments are now short-staffed.\nThe station power plant is only about half-staffed. A power supply failure in the Antarctic environment means water sources could freeze and food would not be safely stored. The fire department was so short staffed they could not fully support the airfield where frequent flights may have to land in inclement weather on an ice runway.\nThis hazard legally barred the New York Air National Guard – who flies special ski-equipped LC-130s on essential cargo flights – from arriving on schedule, greatly impeding logistics and supply chains. They since arrived with a waiver but could not fly regular intracontinental missions for three more weeks until more firefighters from New Zealand arrived.\nThese avoidable, policy-derived setbacks contributed to three of six research projects in West Antarctica canceling before beginning, reducing total supportable research projects from the seasonal average of 60 down to 11, and caused the entire month of normal life in December to be robbed by mask-wearing and canceled holiday events.\nThese policies are dictated by the NSF’s mysterious Covid Control Board. As affected people have attempted to clarify questions or contact this Control Board, no one, at multiple management levels, has been forthright with the identity or public health qualifications of their members. USAP employees with unrelated administrative jobs have had time and energy absconded to develop Covid solutions for a population where Covid does not exist. Their policy is protecting no one from nothing.\n✔️ Boost your immune system with Nutraceutical by Dr. Zev Zelenko\n✔️ Beat supply chain issues and future pharmaceutical tyranny with 5 Antibiotics Delivered to Your Home\n✔️ Be ready to help yourself and your family with the World’s Best Med Kit\nWhen prodded about the senseless and inconsistent policies, USAP managers feebly attempt to defend them without providing any sort of evidence for their foundation. There are no references to any Covid research or CDC guidelines. Questions routed to the NSF leadership addressing these issues have gone unanswered. The real humans subject to these excessive policies have loud voices that are simply being ignored.\nThere is no hope for life at McMurdo void of Covid precautions despite the strict isolation process en route, despite the now 100% vaccinated population, and despite screenings for comorbidities. A recent Covid outbreak at a Belgian research base with similar demographics and no reported health impacts beyond mild symptoms demonstrates the minimal risk of Covid itself while the negative impacts of the policies remain clearly evident.\nYet, workers are threatened with termination if they defy the illogical rules. The things that draw people to McMurdo station have been needlessly lost. Antarctic research – which provides some of our greatest insight for understanding the difficult problem of climate change – has been stymied, community members’ lives have lost value, and all these hindrances are driven not by scientific evidence, but by politics and optics.\nUSAP workers are being uniquely challenged in one of the most uniquely extreme, uniquely isolated, and uniquely Covid free places on earth. If an enterprise mostly created and funded by the NSF cannot utilize scientific reasoning and accept normalcy where there is no Covid, how can we trust our scientific institutions to seek to in the rest of the world, where Covid is here to stay?\nWill America-First News Outlets Make it to 2023?\nThings are looking grim for conservative and populist news sites.\nThere’s something happening behind the scenes at several popular conservative news outlets. 2021 was bad, but 2022 is proving to be disastrous for news sites that aren’t “playing ball” with the corporate media narrative. It’s being said that advertisers are cracking down, forcing some of the biggest ad networks like Google and Yahoo to pull their inventory from conservative outlets. This has had two major effects. First, it has cooled most conservative outlets from discussing “taboo” topics like Pandemic Panic Theater, voter fraud, or The Great Reset. Second, it has isolated those ad networks that aren’t playing ball.\nCertain topics are anathema for most ad networks. Speaking out against vaccines or vaccine mandates is a certain path to being demonetized. Highlighting voter fraud in the 2020 and future elections is another instant advertising death penalty. Throw in truthful stories about climate change hysteria, Critical Race Theory, and the border crisis and it’s easy to understand how difficult it is for America-First news outlets to spread the facts, share conservative opinions, and still pay the bills.\nWithout naming names, I have been told of several news outlets who have been forced to either consolidate with larger organizations or who have backed down on covering certain topics out of fear of being “canceled” by the ad networks. I get it. This is a business for many of us and it’s not very profitable. Those of us who do this for a living are often barely squeaking by, so loss of additional revenue can often mean being forced to make cuts. That means not being able to cover the topics properly. Its a Catch-22: Tell the truth and lose the money necessary to keep telling the truth, or avoid the truth and make enough money to survive. Those who have chosen survival simply aren’t able to spread the truth properly.\nWe will never avoid the truth. The Lord will provide if it is His will. Our job is simply to share the facts, spread the Gospel, and educate as many Americans as possible while exposing the forces of evil.\nTo those who have the means, we ask that you please donate. We have options available now, but there is no telling when those options will cancel us. We have our GivingFuel page. There have been many who have been canceled by PayPal, but for now it’s still an option. Your generosity is what keeps these sites running and allows us to get the truth to the masses. We’ve had great success in growing but we know we can do more with your assistance.\nThank you, and God Bless!", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}

Lichen holobionts show compositional structure along elevation [Dataset]. Dryad. https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.dncjsxm1z\nHolobionts are dynamic ecosystems that may respond to abiotic drivers with compositional changes. Uncovering elevational diversity patterns within these microecosystems can further our understanding of community-environment interactions. Here we assess how the major components of lichen holobionts – fungal hosts, green algal symbionts, and the bacterial community – collectively respond to an elevational gradient.\nWe analyze populations of two lichen symbioses, Umbilicaria pustulata and U. hispanica, along an elevational gradient spanning 2100 altitudinal meters and covering three major biomes. Our study shows (i) discontinuous genomic variation in fungal hosts with one abrupt genomic differentiation within each of the two host species, (ii) altitudinally structured bacterial communities with pronounced turnover within and between hosts, and (iii) altitude-specific presence of algal symbionts. Alpha diversity of bacterial communities decreased with increasing elevation. A marked turnover in holobiont diversity occurred across two altitudinal belts: at 11-13°C average annual temperature (here: 800-1200m a.s.l.), and at 7-9°C average annual temperature (here: 1500-1800m a.s.l.). The two observed zones mark a clustering of distribution limits and community shifts. The three ensuing altitudinal classes, i.e. the most frequent combinations of species in holobionts, approximately correspond to the Mediterranean, cool-temperate, and alpine climate zones. We conclude that multitrophic microecosystems, such as lichen holobionts, respond with concerted compositional changes to climatic factors that also structure communities of macroorganisms, e.g. vascular plants.", "scores": {"score": 3, "score_transform_1": 5, "score_transform_2": 5, "score_transform_3": 0}}

{"id": "1690", "text": "Models For Enzyme Kinetics, Including Cellulases And The Enzymatic Degradation Of Biomass\nNo Access Until\nThis dissertation contains several enzyme kinetics studies, each demonstrating the importance of dimensional analysis in justifying rate expressions and the usefulness of perturbation techniques in generating approximate time-dependent solutions. Our focus has been on the action of cellulases, enzymes which hydrolyze the glycosidic bonds of cellulose, releasing sugars which can be used as feedstock for renewable commodities and fuels. The process involves two fundamental steps at the solid-liquid phase boundary: enzyme binding and hydrolysis. The development of detailed mathematical models plays an essential role in understanding the mechanism of this heterogeneous process. First, we present two homogenous enzyme kinetics studies, where reactions are carried out in a single well-mixed liquid-phase. The first study focuses on the Michaelis-Menten (MM) mechanism for enzyme kinetics. The mass balances for MM kinetics are simple to write but deceptively difficult to solve; consequently, various approximate solutions have been offered over the past 50 years, none of which works in all cases. We generate a uniformly-valid time-dependent solution that converges accurately for any combination of initial conditions, and we systematically define where each previous solution fits within the new solution. In the second study, we investigate the hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl cellobioside by Thermobifida fusca Cel5A, a retaining endocellulase, and develop a mechanistic model for its hydrolysis and transglycosylation in the enzyme's active site. Our work extends previous treatments by providing criteria that justify the use of the quasi-steady-state approximation (QSSA) and provide an integrated form of the resulting rate expression. The results can be extended to other retaining glycosyl hydrolases acting on nitrophenol glycosides. Next, we present a heterogeneous two-phase kinetics model for the hydrolysis of dense cellulose fibers by cellulase enzymes. The model reveals that the shapes of the time-dependent liquid phase concentration curves can appear nearly identical even when different underlying mechanisms are dominant. The results substantiate the importance of including penetration and local reaction history in cellulase kinetics models and of more carefully measuring the evolving shapes of fibers when applying such models. Finally, we review our collaborative efforts to develop a synthetic cellulose substrate with controlled microstructure and physical properties.", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}

{"id": "1744", "text": "By Connor Lynch\nOSGOODE — When the Canadian government announced on March 16 that the border was closing to non-Americans amid the coronavirus outbreak, it was bad news for many farmers.\nTemporary foreign workers have been the backbone of the veggie and horticultural sectors in Ontario for years, and losing access to them could’ve been disastrous. Some 20,000 migrant workers come to Ontario every year to work on farms, mostly from Mexico, Jamaica and the Caribbean. The federal government ultimately decided it would allow the workers in, but require them to first isolate for 14 days.\nBut with flights grounded, they still have to get here. Foreign Agricultural Resources Management Services president Ken Forth said the organization was chartering flights to Jamaica to get workers in, with farmers paying out of pocket. The first flight was to arrive the night of April 1 at Toronto’s Pearson airport. The 14-day delay to start work was unquestionably going to cause the industry grief, he said, with farmers having to pay employees with no work getting done. Forth said however that: “I would encourage farmers to do exactly what’s asked, follow all the rules. Rules are made for everybody.”\nCrop farmer Mel Foster at Osgoode, south of urban Ottawa, brings in about 15 migrant workers every year, starting in April but with the bulk of them arriving in June. He planted about 18,000 onions in his fields on March 16, and for the moment his other planting plans are going ahead on the assumption all of his workers would be coming. But the 14-day isolation period is going to cost him as much as $17,000, he said, if his workers even make it. For bigger farms, it’ll be even worse.\nEASTERN ONTARIO: Farmers relying on migrant workers spooked by news of border closure\nBy Connor Lynch", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}
{"id": "1749", "text": "The Universal energies floating about the earth over the next few days are designed to create a new sense of self within your being.\nYour entire being is shifting in ways that words cannot completely describe.\nEven though you have been shifting for months, years, or decades, this shift is different because you will change within minutes or days instead of months or years. You may feel tired, anti-social, or need to be with others. It does not matter. All that matters is listening to your needs and following them.\nMany of you feel no different than you did yesterday or last month, and such will remain true. As a child, you did not necessarily notice evolving from playing with building blocks to reading a paragraph book. It just happened as it seemed right to happen. So it is now.\nYou have new needs to fulfill. Even though who you were yesterday is no longer, no apparent indicators allow you to understand how different your unique skillset is.\nYou will develop a need or thought one day and create it the next. For example, you might hear words within your being before the person you are with states them. Or need to be in a particular place, even though being in that place does not seem logical.\nOnce you tap into Universal skills, there are no limits to what is possible. But because you are unique, you will tap into skills essential for your advancement, but not necessarily for your partner or next-door neighbor.\nEach step into new you is a unique adventure that can only be fully addressed by you. Perhaps you will understand what another is thinking without hearing words. Or close your eyes, remaining fully conscious, and fly hither and yon. Or address others from your heart instead of your mind. And on and on, from one new amazing skill to another.\nBut you will not necessarily wake to a specific skill. You might find yourself dancing around various skills until one strikes the right note for you, like selecting a color to paint your bedroom.\nIt does not matter how you dabble in various skills – either the length of time or variety. What does matter is you are no longer stable in your knowingness or being, as was true in 3D. In 3D, you shifted with age and experience. Your progression was linear and expected. What you are delving into this week and forevermore is the unknown, the unexpected, the new, or whatever phrase you choose.\nWhat was is no more, including you – as of this week. Perhaps you will awake with a new skill or wish to pursue a new skill. Maybe you will float into that skill without acknowledging it until you look back at who you once were. It does not matter. All that matters is you are adding skills necessary for your new being and doing so without reaching beyond yourself as was necessary in 3D. It will happen without needing to practice, pray, pay for services, or do anything other than just be.\nBut you might find yourself emotional and exhausted. Imagine how tired you would have been if your first-grade teacher insisted you understand graduate-level texts before progressing to the second grade. You would likely have had difficulties sleeping, playing, eating, or fulfilling common age-appropriate attributes. Something similar is happening now. The difference is you do not have to do anything other than ride the waves to and through your new attributes.\nYou will attain your new skill or skillset even if you are fearful. It just is. Just as male voices change in puberty.\nMonths ago, en masse, you established when this shift would happen. It is like a train slowly chugging along until it picks up speed and races through the countryside. You are now racing to fulfill this critical stage of your being.\nAccept this preplanned shift without trying to slow your speed or sequence of events. Doing so will only stress your being. Allow yourself to flow, and your new skills will appear or be enhanced without effort or support from others.\nYour new being is not only peeking out from your physical being; it is shouting to the world, “I’m not in Kansas anymore and never will be again.”\nAllow yourself to rest when you are tired and play when you have the energy to do so. Do not be frightened by your inner thoughts, words, or need for action. You are you in all your new shining glory. So be it. Amen.\nLifeTapestryCreations.com.

I think it's fair to say that most LF photographers would agree that modern photography with its focus on digital devices and processes is pointless, although there are some who seem to have a foot in each camp, using both digital and film, which I don't understand. For me, I seem to be going further back in time, seeking a 'look' in my images which even if it can be produced digitally just goes against the grain for me to do so. I find myself working simpler and simpler as time goes on. I don't use the zone system any more, not consciously anyway, and my spot meter seldom gets an outing now. Over the last 5-6 years I've been re-exploring pinhole photography with rewarding (to me) results. So this is my journey - to each his own, of course - but you'll never catch me setting digital menus. The image below was done on my latest pinhole camera. 5x7 Kodak double-sided x-ray film at ASA 100, 15 sec exposure, Pyrocat HD. I built the camera with +/- 25mm horizontal shift, mainly for vertical compositions as used here.

{"id": "1807", "text": "Tottenham Hotspur certainly suffered no Carabao Cup hangover in the Burnley sunshine today as the much-changed Ange Postecoglou XI recorded a 5-2 victory.\nLet’s take a look at the five things we learned:\nChanging the team\nAnge Postecoglou changed the team back to what is likely his first-choice, and Spurs purred more than ever before this season. Despite going behind early and finding themselves in a 1-1 battle for a long time, Spurs eventually ran away with the game, scoring five in the process. I know Postecoglou wanted to take a look at some of his squad players, but it does make you wonder what could have been achieved by changing just half the team, rather than 9 players.\nHeung-min Son number 9\nHeung-min Son took over as the number 9 today when Richarlison was benched, and boy, did he perform well! For a significant portion of the game, he was relatively quiet and didn’t see much of the ball, but once Spurs entered the final third, he came to life. Additionally, he appeared to relish being the defensive unit’s shoulder far more than Richarlison has in previous weeks. Postecoglou is now faced with a difficult decision: who will be his preferred striker going forward?\nTottenham are fun, Tottenham are chaos\nNo matter what happens this year, Tottenham will be the most fascinating team to watch. Yes, there is something to be said about Man City’s hegemony or Brighton’s tenacious energy, but Spurs are providing excitement on both ends. Full-scale attack and feigned defense. What is there to dislike? After all, isn’t that why we’re here—to be entertained?\nGoal from all over the pitch\nPostecoglou seemed to have excelled at something that Antonio Conte struggled with: scoring goals all across the field. Tottenham also has goals from Maddison, Emerson Royal, Romero, Pape Matar Sarr, and Ben Davies (sort of), who are all now unbeaten this season. Sonny, Kulusevski, and Richarlison are all now all off the mark. It has been Harry Kane’s responsibility to score the goals and win the games for so long, but once that responsibility is shared, it must be much more difficult to play against.\nUp to second in the table\nPostecoglou won’t like to look at the table so early, and even fans shouldn’t really, but 10 points from 12, including Brentford away and a game against Man United. Sitting second in the Premier League is fun, whatever point of the season it may be. However, it should also be a warning sign. We all know that Mourinho and Conte both also enjoyed positive starts to seasons, as did Nuno Espirito Santo, so there is a lot more work to be done for Postecoglou and his side.", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

However, pollinator declines in recent decades have been steep and severe due to habitat loss, parasites, pesticides and other threats. Monarch populations, for example, have plummeted by 90 percent in the last 20 years.\n“One thing is clear, Americans love pollinators and their efforts are paying off. Research in recent studies have shown that even small gardens can make a difference for pollinators by increasing diversity of bee species across urban and suburban landscapes.” says Mary Phillips, senior director at the National Wildlife Federation, one of the founders of the National Pollinator Garden Network.\nBees, butterflies, hummingbirds, bats and other pollinators pollinate one-third of food crops while flying from plant to plant.

{"id": "1884", "text": "The 30 Most Powerful Trucks on the Road\n2019 RAM 1500 – 410 lb.-ft.\nThe RAM 1500 was recently designed and delivers strong capabilities along with 410 pound-feet of torque. For the most torque, upgrade to the 5.7-liter V8 engine with 395 horsepower and the previously mentioned torque figure. Compared to the previous RAM, the 2019 version has a boost of about 20 percent to both hauling and towing. You can configure it to handle a payload of up to 2,300 pounds and to tow as much as 12,750 pounds. The truck is also very well-rounded, especially if you opt for one of the more luxurious trims.\n2018 Ford F-150 Raptor – 510 lb.-ft.\nThe Ford F-150 Raptor is one of the multiple versions of the popular Ford F-150 that is powerful enough for this list yet unique enough to be mentioned separately. The Raptor gives you 510 pound-feet of torque plus 450 horsepower, ensuring that you will get your thrills as you drive along in the F-150. The engine is a 3.5-liter V6 with turbochargers and fitted to work with four-wheel drive as standard. The Raptor particularly excels off-road thanks to a locking rear differential and rugged suspension. This is the Ford F-150 to go with if you want high torque and off-roading in your truck.\n2018 RAM 1500 EcoDiesel – 420 lb.-ft.\nThe RAM 1500 stood out in 2014 when it became the first half-ton pickup in modern times to offer drivers a turbocharged diesel engine. As of 2018, it was still the only auto in its class to do so. The EcoDiesel has a 3.0-liter V6 turbodiesel engine that works with an 8-speed automatic transmission. The 420 pound-feet of torque from this pickup are supplemented by its 240 horsepower. The “EcoDiesel” in the name is not much of an exaggeration, as the truck gets 27 mpg highway. There are also two fuel tank sizes, so you do not have to stop to fuel up often.\nChevrolet Silverado (V8) – 460 lb.-ft.\nEquipping the Chevrolet Silverado with the powerful 6.2-liter V8 gas engine gives you an impressive amount of torque, 460 pound-feet, along with a capable gas engine. This top-spec V8 from General Motors also provides drivers with 420 horsepower. With this version of the vehicle, drivers can tow up to six tons. The V8 engine in question that delivers this torque arrived in late 2013, giving Chevy a narrow lead over Ford in terms of top torque and horsepower. The 2019 Silverado continues the trend, maintaining the engine output while maximizing the interior comfort and tech.\n2018 GMC Sierra 2500 – 910 lb.-ft.\nAlthough the Chevy Silverado and GMC Sierra are nearly identical in many ways, the GMC Sierra offers the same 910 pound-feet of torque in the 2500 version that the Silverado does in the 3500HD. This comes via the same 6.6-liter Duramax V8 turbocharged diesel and six-speed Allison automatic. The Sierra 2500 can handle conventional towing of 14,500 pounds with 4WD or 2WD. It also offers the benefit of the luxurious Denali model with its high-end interior. Consider the Sierra 2500 Denali if you want that premium feel along with your over 900 pound-feet of torque.\n2018 RAM Heavy-Duty 2500 – 429 lb.-ft.\nYet another example showing that RAM knows how to produce powerful trucks, the 2018 RAM Heavy Duty 2500 gives drivers 429 pound-feet of torque along with 410 horsepower. This is not the strongest engine in the RAM 2500 lineup, but it is the most powerful gas one in the lineup. If you want a diesel, look at the version later on the list. Otherwise, the 6.4-liter HEMI V8 engine will give you 429 pound-feet, letting you haul 3,990 pounds or tow 16,320 pounds. It also has a comfortable ride and a spacious cabi\nGMC Sierra (V8) – 460 lb.-ft.\nAny list that mentions the Chevy Silverado will also include the GMC Sierra since the two are nearly identical. The 2019 GMC Sierra was redesigned for the 2019 model year, with the 6.2-liter V8 offering 420 horsepower along with the 460 pound-feet of torque. You also get updated tech and features, from Wi-Fi hot spot capabilities to an 8-inch touchscreen to a Bose audio system. The cabin is also high quality, making the Sierra incredibly tempting for those in search of a fully capable gas-fueled pickup truck with plenty of torque.\n2020 Ford Super Duty (V8 Gas) – 475 lb.-ft.\nClaiming the title of segment-best gas torque and power, the 2020 Ford Super Duty with the 7.3-liter V8 uses an all-new engine. This powertrain delivers 430 horsepower with that 475 pound-feet of torque at 4,000 rpm. You can enjoy this engine with any of the Super Duty configurations you want, with the exception of the F-450, which is only available as a diesel engine. With the gas engine’s torque, you can tow up to 21,200 pounds with a gooseneck or fifth-wheel trailer or 21,000 pounds conventionally. For more power, go with the diesel.\n2004 to 2006 Dodge RAM SRT10 – 525 lb.-ft.\nIf you find a Dodge DRAM SRT10 from between 2004 and 2006, you will find yourself behind the wheel of an 8.3-liter V10 engine that was originally found in the Dodge Viper. This engine gives the truck 525 pound-feet of torque, working with 500 horsepower. For a pickup, especially one with a gas engine, this is truly impressive. In fact, at the time, the SRT10 was the Guinness World Record holder as the fastest full-sized pickup. This title continued as of recently. Between the speed and torque, this truck is also a gas guzzler, so keep that in mind.\n2018 Chevrolet Colorado (Duramax) – 369 lb.-ft.\nThe 2018 Chevrolet Colorado has more than enough torque to satisfy the average driver, especially when configured with the 2.8-liter Duramax turbodiesel 4-cylinder engine. In addition to 369 pound-feet of torque, it generates 181 horsepower. Its low-to-mid approach to torque means that the Colorado with the Duramax engine offers the perfect balance between power and efficiency, getting 30 mpg on the highway with 2WD and 28 mpg with 4WD. These figures drop slightly with the 4WD Colorado ZR2, but you also get a state-of-the-art suspension system and locking differentials for off-roading.\n2018 GMC Canyon (Duramax) – 369 lb.-ft.\nThe GMC Canyon is the mechanical twin to the Chevrolet Colorado, so it should be no surprise that this truck is also on the list. Like the Colorado, the 2018 Canyon with the 2.8-liter Duramax turbodiesel generates 369 pound-feet of torque, along with 186 horsepower. It also uses the same six-speed automatic transmission. The Canyon gets 30 or 28 mpg on the highway, depending on whether it is 2WD or 4WD. You can add luxury to the power with the Canyon Denali or enhance its off-roading powers with the All-Terrain Trim.\n2018 Nissan Titan – 394 lb.-ft.\nThe 2018 Nissan Titan is not quite as impressive as the Titan XD, but it is still powerful enough to earn a spot on this list. The truck is agile to an extent that will surprise most drivers and the 5.6-liter V8 delivers 394 pound-feet of torque along with 390 horsepower. The engine gives you accurate handling and solid acceleration, perfect for all of your driving needs. You can equip the Titan to tow 9,740 pounds or carry a payload of 1,950 pounds. As with the torque, the figures are impressive but can be beaten by competitors.\n2018 Ford F-150 – 400 lb.-ft.\nThe Ford F-150 is a popular truck year after year thanks to its capability, reliability, and other factors. Choose the 5.0-liter V8 engine instead of a turbocharged V6 to get the 400 pound-feet of torque and 395 horsepower. This engine output results in fuel economy, power, and excellent hauling and towing. Some people who get behind the wheel will also notice hints of the Ford Mustang’s muscle car nature, delivering some thrills as you drive. The 2018 model year even has some new safety tech compared to previous Ford F-150s.\n2017 and 2018 Toyota Tundra – 401 lb.-ft.\nThe 2017 Toyota Tundra gives drivers behind the wheel access to more than 400 pound-feet of torque, along with 381 horsepower. This comes courtesy of the Tundra’s 5.7-liter V6 engine. The result was a clear sign that Toyota is a real player in the world of full-size pickup trucks. This V8 engine lets the Tundra tow over 10,000 pounds with ease and carry a literal ton of cargo in its bed. Just keep in mind that compared to some of the other pickups on this list, the interior feels a bit dated.\n2017 Dodge RAM 1500 Tradesman (V8) – Over 400 lb.-ft.\nThe RAM 1500 Tradesman is one of the more basic configurations of the Dodge RAM full-size pickup, but it certainly does a great job at delivering power. Going with the 5.7-liter Hemi V8 engine gives you more than 400 pound-feet of torque, 390 horsepower, and 20 mpg on the highway. That pickup also has a towing capacity of 10,000 pounds, a factory warranty for 100,000 miles, and the choice of four-wheel drive. The result is a great value for your power, even today. This truck is also available with a V6 engine but you should expect less torque from it.\n2001 to 2004 Ford SVT Lightning – 450 lb.-ft.\nOne of the most powerful trucks with a gas engine, the Ford models from 2001 to 2004 equipped with the Lightning’s engine delivers 450 pound-feet. Unfortunately, that amazing torque results in massive fuel consumption and somewhat of a reduction in truck usability. This made the Lightning powerful but not the most practical. You can still find it with its 5.4-liter supercharged Triton V8, towing capacity of 5,000 pounds, and payload capacity of 1,350 pounds. The truck offered all that power along with affordability given its specs, which helped its appeal somewhat.\n2018 Nissan Titan XD – 555 lb.-ft.\nThe 2018 Nissan Titan XD made headlines upon its arrival for multiple reasons, including its ability to straddle the line between a light-duty and heavy-duty pickup. This diesel-powered version runs on a 5.0-liter turbodiesel V8 from Cummins. That V8 provides 555 pound-feet plus 310 horsepower, controlled via the six-speed Aisin automatic. Experts say that the V8 was designed for RAM despite its spot in the Nissan lineup. You can also maximize the off-road-worthiness of this auto with the PRO-4X trim that has skid plates, electronic locking rear differential, and Bilstein off-road shocks.\n2015 Chevrolet Silverado (Duramax) – 765 lb.-ft.\nThe 2015 Chevrolet Silverado with the Duramax diesel engine is easily among the most powerful trucks ever made, generating 765 pound-feet of torque. The engine is a 6.6-liter unit that also has 397 horsepower. Amazingly enough, this impressive torque is at only 1,300 rpm. Such power and torque are necessary given that the auto weighs 7,500 pounds. Despite that weight, the power lets it reach 60 mph in just 7.2 seconds. To top it all off, the interior can be downright luxurious with plenty of space and leather upholstery to stretch out on.\n2018 Ford Super Duty (F-250) – 925 lb.-ft.\nThe Ford Super Duty shows off its torque in multiple configurations, including the F-250, when configured to feature the 6.7-liter V8 Power Stroke turbodiesel. This engine gives the F-250 925 pound-feet along with 450 horsepower. It is even available in the King Ranch trim, which is among the automaker’s most popular trims for this pickup with its luxurious features that are not the most expensive option. With a gooseneck of fifth-wheel, you can use it to tow 18,500 pounds. Those who need even more towing capabilities or a bit more torque can look at the F-350 or F-450 instead of the F-250.\n2018 RAM 3500 Laramie Longhorn – 930 lb.-ft.\nSince it weighs a full ton, the 2018 RAM 3500 Laramie Longhorn needs plenty of horsepower and torque to get moving, both of which it delivers on. The 6.7-liter Cummins turbodiesel that we have seen on this list several times gives this pickup 930 pound-feet and 385 horsepower. You can choose from an automatic or manual transmission with this incredibly powerful diesel engine, both of which will have six speeds. As a bonus, the Laramie Longhorn stands out with its supple leather upholstery and other high-end elements, like the RamBox cargo management system and auto-leveling air suspension in the rear.\n2015 Ford (Power Stroke) – 860 lb.-ft.\nChoosing to go with the 6.6-liter Power Stroke V8 engine in your Ford truck will put you in control of 860 pound-feet of torque, along with 440 horsepower. To put that into perspective, the 7.3-liter Power Stroke diesel from Ford during the middle of the 1990s had less than half that torque. Thanks to this powerful engine, this Ford Power Stroke can tow as much as 15 tons, something which shows just how far the industry standard has risen over the years. To complement the engine, this Ford also has commercial-grade rubber, big brakes, and a Dana S110 rear axle.\n2018 Ford Super Duty (F-450) – 935 lb.-ft.\nThe 2018 Ford Super Duty comes with a towing capacity of 34,000 pounds to accompany its 935 pound-feet of torque, which was a boost of 10 pound-feet over the previous year. It also has 450 horsepower, an improvement of 10. Conventional hitch towing for this powerful truck is 21,000 pounds and there is a payload capacity of 7,360 pounds. These figures all apply to the F-450, which was available in a range of trim choices to appeal to the tastes of anyone. At the time of its release, Ford recommended a commercial license to use all the features of this truck.\n2019 Ford Super Duty (F-250) – 935 lb.-ft.\nIf you opt for the 2019 model year instead of the 2018, you will find yourself with the ability to get the same impressive 935 pound-feet of torque, but on the lighter and more affordable F-250 Super Duty instead of requiring an upgrade to the F-450. Enjoy 450 horsepower as well, courtesy of the 6.7-liter turbodiesel V8. Configure it properly and the F-250 will tow 21,000 pounds with ease. If that seems like an impressive figure, that is because it is the class-leading towing capacity that truly sets the Ford pickup ahead of the pack.\n2019 RAM Heavy Duty (Tuned Diesel) – 1,000 lb.-ft.\nThe tuned version of the 2019 RAM Heavy Duty with the diesel engine is even more powerful, 1,000 pound-feet thanks to this 6.7-liter Cummins turbodiesel. At its launch in early 2019, this made it the most powerful as well as “most capable” pickup within the segment. It also has 400 horsepower, a 7,680-pound payload capacity, and a 35,100-pound towing capacity. Like the detuned version, it lost 60 pounds and has stronger, lighter pistons as well as a new cast-iron cylinder block and cylinder head. The suspension is ready to keep up with the higher payloads that this truck can handle.\n2014 to 2018 Dodge RAM (Cummins) – 800 lb.-ft.\nConfiguring the 2014 Dodge RAM with the Cummins turbodiesel engine gives you a vehicle with a whopping 800 pound-feet, working with 370 horsepower. This turbodiesel is a 6.7-liter straight-six. Thanks to this power, the 2014 RAM 3500 can tow 30,000 pounds. The more recent 2018 version uses the 6.7-liter Cummins High-Output turbodiesel, for the same output. Control everything via the six-speed automatic or the available six-speed manual. Going with the 2018 model year not only gets you this 800 pound-feet, but it also offers a full range of trims and colors, from the Limited Tungsten at the top of the range to the Tradesman without thrills.\n2019 RAM Super Duty (Detuned Diesel) – 850 lb.-ft.\nOne of the big pulls for the 2019 RAM Super Duty is the diesel powertrain that can generate 850 pound-feet of torque even without any special tuning. It works with a six-speed automatic transmission that is electronically controlled and was specifically designed to work with the massive torque, including that of the more powerful tuned version. This is the latest generation of the diesel powertrain, which is lighter, dropping 60 pounds compared to the previous version. It also has other updates to help with that massive output, with or without engine tuning.\n2018 Dodge RAM (Cummins) – Over 900 lb.-ft.\nWhile a previous version of the Dodge RAM with the Cummins turbodiesel engine already made this list, the 2018 version showed enough of an improvement to warrant its own listing. On the 3500 trim, this RAM with the Cummins can put you in control of more than 900 pound-feet, along with 385 horsepower. It also features a best-in-class towing capacity of 30,000 pounds. This engine is so powerful that it can be used for marine, railroad, and stationary environments as well. As is typical of RAM, there is also the choice of trims, with six options to select from.\n2018 and 2019 Chevrolet Silverado 2500HD and 3500HD – 910 lb.-ft.\nThe 2018 Chevrolet Silverado 3500HD offers multiple engines, including the 6.6-liter Duramax V8 that will maximize your torque at 910 pound-feet. This turbodiesel engine can be paired with dual-rear-wheel or single-rear-wheel configurations. In addition to that impressive torque, the Duramax also gives this Silverado 445 horsepower, controlled via a 6-speed automatic from Allison. Use this torque to tow up to 20,000 pounds with conventional towing or 23,300 pounds with a gooseneck or fifth-wheel. Before the new line of 4500 and 5500 pickups in 2019, this was the go-to Chevy workhorse.", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}
{"id": "1887", "text": "Mashable’s Social Media Day provides an excellent opportunity to examine how social media has transformed marketing. Social media has profoundly altered how marketers, consumers, the media and the general public view and experience companies and their products. Older marketing tools and platforms have not gone away, but social media has certainly created a lot of new and exciting options.\nHere are thirteen ways that social media has changed marketing:\n- Social media speeds up message dissemination by providing platforms and empowering consumers to share content in its entirety or edited, in the users’ own words, or a combination of the two.\n- Social media has transferred brand ownership to consumers. Gone is the notion that a company can tightly control its brand(s). Rather, your prospects, customers and the general public have the power to direct and modify your brand’s perception through their experience, both directly and via friends and strangers.\n- Social media extends your message’s reach to a broader base of prospects that may be difficult to target via other means. Collectively, these platforms attract a large, engaged audience connected via family, friends, interests and other influencers and who may not be heavy users of traditional media.\n- Social media uses a human voice, face, personality and words to engage prospects and customers rather than sanitized, faceless corporate-speak. As a result, this may change the content, timing and channel in which marketing messages appear.\n- Social media encourages interaction with customers. Companies can and must respond to feedback from consumers via one-to-one and many-to-many communications.\n- Social media provides platforms that amplify and distribute consumers’ opinion more broadly. As a result, consumer influence is no longer limited to one’s immediate family and friends but reaches a wider audience more quickly. These public perspectives may be more widely dispersed and influential than your marketing message.\n- Social media requires more vigilant reputation management and engagement since negatively perceived company actions as well as customers comments and/or feedback can go viral. One salient example is “United Breaks Guitars”. Therefore, think about how consumers view your actions and monitor consumer input rather than relying on your internal perceptions and corporate-speak.\n- Social media provides great platforms for just-in-time marketing through a variety of technologies and devices that enable marketers to sway consumer buying decisions just prior to purchase by offering alternatives based on location, price or other factors.\n- Social media enables consumers to make more informed purchase decisions. As a result, they examine more options and may be influenced by a broader array of people and factors that extend beyond your marketing messages. From a marketing perspective, this results in delayed buying decisions and longer purchase processes.\n- Social media provides more product support before and after purchase. This includes product specifics such as sizing, customer service, returns and helpful information/training that comes both from companies and other consumers.\n- Social media enables more effective niche and micro-segment targeting across an array of attributes, including demographics, psychographics and past behaviors. Since many of these characteristics are self-declared, market segmentation is more effective.\n- Social media has influenced the organizational structure and changed organizational dynamics by empowering a broader proportion of employees to participate and contribute to the public knowledge and product support. As a result, employees who are willing to extend themselves raise their visibility both internally and externally. This translates to a need for companies to have social media guidelines to protect the company and its employees regardless of its social media engagement.\n- Social media, like other online media formats, has difficulty reaching mass markets as compared to traditional mass message vehicles such as television. As a result, marketers must think in terms of integrating their messages across multiple media platforms.\nAs social media and how marketers use it to promote their offering evolves and expands, one thing is for certain: consumer influence and interconnectivity will be a growing and important factor in your marketing mix.\nWhat other ways have you seen social media changing marketing?

{"id": "1892", "text": "Bred to work closely with their handlers, Portuguese Pointers are hardy, alert, and eager to please. With their limitless affection and calm, social nature, these smart dogs make fans out of hunters and housemates alike.\nPortuguese Pointer Traits\nThe Portuguese Pointer is a medium-sized, balanced dog with a square face that sets it apart from other breeds.\nCoat and Coloring\nThe Portuguese Pointer's coat is short and dense. On the back, the hair is somewhat coarse to the touch. But on the head and ears, it's soft and velvety. Like others in the Pointer family, this breed's coat comes in shades of light yellow, yellow, or red-yellow with white patches.\nDistinctive Physical Traits\nLike their heads, Portuguese Pointers' bodies are almost square. Their ears are triangular and drop style. And their tails are straight and medium length, tapering to a point.\nPortuguese Pointer Temperament\nThe Portuguese Pointer is an energetic breed that loves to be among people and makes a great family pet. Curious by nature, these friendly dogs are fun to be around.\nPortuguese Pointers are extraordinarily affectionate and devoted to their family members. However, they can be a little arrogant around other dogs.\nPortuguese Pointer History\nThe Portuguese Pointer descended from the 12th-century Peninsular Pointing Dog from the Iberian Peninsula. Nobles and royals originally bred these handsome dogs for falconry work—a job Portuguese Pointers continue to do in Portugal today.\nIn the 16th century, Portuguese Pointers grew popular among partridge hunters. In fact, the dogs became known as the perdigueiro—a name derived from the Portuguese word \"perdiz,\" meaning \"partridge.\"\nLater, in the 18th century, English families living in the wine region of Portugal brought Portuguese Pointers along when returning to England for vacation. These dogs helped found the English Pointer breed.\nSocial hardships and lack of ownership nearly wiped out the Portuguese Pointer in the 19th century. But in the 1920s, breeders successfully preserved the breed with the help of dogs in north Portugal.\nThe Portuguese Pointer has been a member of the American Kennel Club Foundation Stock Service since 2005.\nPortuguese Pointer Care\nPortuguese Pointers need high-quality food that's appropriate for their life stage (e.g., puppy, adult, senior.) All dogs are at risk for obesity if they eat too many calories. Avoid accidental overfeeding by measuring out meals. And be sure to include calories from treats when calculating their daily intake. As a general guideline, treats should make up no more than 10% of a dog's calories.\nKeeping a Portuguese Pointer's coat in good shape is relatively easy. All it takes is an occasional once-over with a rubber curry brush to remove loose hair. This breed's coarse hair is rather good at repelling dirt and rarely needs washing.\nYour Portuguese Pointer's nails will wear down during regular activity. But you should still inspect them routinely for splits or cracks and trim them as needed. Overgrown nails can be painful and could eventually lead to issues walking or running.\nFinally, maintaining good dental hygiene is essential for the overall long-term health of all dogs. In addition to scheduling professional dental cleanings, aim to establish an at-home routine that includes regular teeth brushing.\nBred to work, Portuguese Pointers are energetic dogs that need regular exercise and mental stimulation to be happy.

{"id": "1901", "text": "Introduction: In the ever-evolving landscape of online content creation, YouTube stands as a juggernaut, offering creators a platform to showcase their talents. However, the quest for visibility and engagement has led some to explore unconventional avenues, one of which is the option to buy YouTube views online. This controversial practice has sparked debates within the content creation community, with proponents highlighting its potential benefits, and skeptics questioning its authenticity and long-term impact.\nPros of Buying YouTube Views: Proponents argue that purchasing YouTube views can jumpstart a channel’s growth by enhancing its visibility and credibility. Increased view counts may attract more organic traffic, as users often gravitate towards content with higher view numbers. Furthermore, a higher view count may make a video appear more appealing to potential sponsors and advertisers, opening up monetization opportunities for content creators. In essence, buying views can be seen as an investment to kickstart a channel’s journey toward recognition in the vast YouTube ecosystem.\nCons and Risks: However, the practice of buying YouTube views is not without its pitfalls. One of the primary concerns is the risk of violating YouTube’s terms of service, which explicitly prohibit the use of artificial methods to inflate views. Violations can lead to severe consequences, including video removal, channel suspension, or even permanent bans. Additionally, purchased views may not translate to genuine engagement, as these views might be from non-targeted or inactive audiences. This lack of authentic interaction can ultimately harm a channel’s reputation and hinder its long-term growth.\nThe Ethical Dilemma: The ethical considerations surrounding buying YouTube views are a crucial aspect of the debate. Content creators must weigh the short-term benefits against the potential long-term consequences, both in terms of their relationship with the platform and their audience’s trust. In a space where authenticity and genuine connection are valued, creators may find themselves facing a moral dilemma when contemplating the purchase of views to boost their online presence.\nConclusion: In the dynamic world of YouTube content creation, the decision to buy views online is a nuanced choice with potential advantages and risks. Creators must carefully evaluate their goals, ethical stance, and the potential impact on their channel before delving into this controversial practice. Ultimately, the path to sustainable growth on YouTube may require a delicate balance between strategic promotion, authentic engagement, and a commitment to the platform’s guidelines.

A multi-billion dollar loan from the International Monetary Fund has helped to some degree, however, the nation is in desperate need of any economic boost it can find.\nOne idea that has gained traction lately is to cultivate medical cannabis and export it. The emerging legal cannabis industry is spreading across the globe and already providing economic boosts wherever it is permitted to operate. A group of experts is being assembled to explore how Sri Lanka can get in on the action. Per News 1st:\nSri Lanka is proposing to explore the possibility of exporting marijuana.\nPresident Ranil Wickremesinghe delivering the 2023 Budget speech said that a committee of experts will be appointed to explore the possibility of cultivating marijuana in Sri Lanka ONLY for export purposes.\nCannabis policy is complicated in Sri Lanka, but views regarding cannabis prohibition are evolving within the nation’s borders, just as they are elsewhere throughout the region ever since Thailand started to lead the way.\nSri Lanka is in a rough spot, in that it doesn’t share a land border with any other nation, which limits economic opportunity in some ways. Fortunately, the cannabis industry can operate in some form anywhere on earth, including in Sri Lanka.\nThe faster the reported committee of experts can come up with a viable plan, the better, as other countries are not waiting around for Sri Lanka to get things in gear. The opportunities for exports today will not be the same in a year as the legal international cannabis industry becomes more crowded and more competitive every passing month.", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

{"id": "1988", "text": "Japan Real Time Charts and Data\nThursday, July 31, 2008\nPrices of Japan's most frequently purchased goods rose 4.2 percent in June, prompting households to reduce spending for a fourth month. Sales at department stores were down 7.6 percent, the fastest pace in a decade, due to the rising prices of daily necessities, according to the Japan Department Store Association.\nReal wages (ie corrected for inflation) were down annually by 2.9%, the third consecutive month of decline.\nWednesday, July 30, 2008\nThe Trade Ministry also lowered its assessment of industrial production, saying output is weakening after previously describing it as flat with signs of weakness. Companies plan to cut production 0.2 percent in July and 0.6 percent in August, the survey showed. The June drop completes two quarters of declining production, the first back-to-back contraction since 2001, when the country was in a recession.\nTuesday, July 29, 2008\nThe ratio of job offers available for each applicant slipped to 0.91, the lowest since February 2005. As compared with June 2007 there were 400,000 less people employed in June 2008. This last data`point is, perhaps, the clearest indicator of the deteriorating job market in Japan.\nSpending by Japanese households also fell by 1.8 percent year on year in real terms - to an average 281,951 yen ($2,624.30) - in June. The most significant declines were in spending on housing renovations, clothing and food, according to the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications press release.\nThis was the fourth straight month of decline and followed a 3.2 percent drop\nin May. The overall household income also fell 2.1 percent, with the income of\nhousehold heads down 4.1 percent. Extraordinary income - basically bonuses - fell\n7.1 percent in June from a year earlier.\nBefore adjustment for inflation retail sales rose 0.3 percent in June from June 2007 as consumers found themselves having to pay more for petrol and food. When adjusted for inflation, sales slumped 3.3 percent, again the fourth consecutive monthly decline.\nThe Bank of Japan cut its assessment of the economy this month, stating that the economy was slowing \"further\" because of weak business investment and consumer spending. I think what we now need to see is the July export and industrial production data, and then we can more or less decide whether this is simply a one quarter contraction (Q2) or a full-blown recession with the contraction extending into Q3.\nFriday, July 25, 2008\nConsumer confidence fell in June to the lowest level in at least 26 years because prices of daily necessities are rising faster than wages. Goods purchased at least 15 times a year climbed 4.2 percent in June, almost twice the pace of the previous month. Wages rose 0.8 percent in May. And as we saw yesterday Japanese exports shrank (y-o-y) for the first time in nearly five years in June as the growth in shipments to emerging markets that had underpinned demand failed to offset the global impact of the US and European economic slowdowns.\nThursday, July 24, 2008\nJapan's exports fell year on year for the first time in more than four years in June (although they had been down month on month in both May and April, and ironically they were up in June over May) Exports decreased 1.7 percent in June 2007, according to the Finance Ministry this morning. The drop was the first since November 2003.\nExports to the U.S. were down by 15.4 percent year on year, and this was the 10th monthly drop and the biggest since November 2003. Shipments to Europe were down 11.2 percent, the second straight decline. Exports to China have been, more or less, holding up, and were up 5.1% on the year, although this is still down from a 12.2% rate of increase in May. Exports to Asia in general rose 1.5 percent, the slowest pace in two years.\nCentral banks across Asia have been raising interest rates to combat inflation, slowing economic growth and weakening demand for Japanese goods. Policy makers in the Philippines, Thailand and Indonesia all raised borrowing costs this month. It is quite possible that the Reserve Bank of India will increase rates again next week.\nExports to Vietnam rose at an annual 28.9%, down from its February peak of 88% (y-o-y), to India they were down to 19.3% from 40.1% in February, Brzil was down to 20.7% from 38.6% in February. Only exports to Indonesia (at 26.6% y-o-y) and Russia, at 39.4% (y-o-y) are really holding up, and these are, of course, oil exporters.\nImports on the other hand climbed 16.2 percent to a record because of the surging oil costs. That caused the trade surplus to shrink 89 percent to 138.6 billion yen ($1.3 billion). This will obviously have a negative impact on GDP growth.\nMy feeling is that with exports now falling y-o-y (they have already been falling m-o-m), and domestic consumption congenitally weak there is really now no way Japan can avoid recession (and my guess is that we are seeing the same thing in Germany).\nThe mechanics that did it are easy enough to identify. First there was the slowdown in the US, which Japan compensated for by growth in Europe as the dollar went down and the Euro went up, then there was the slowdown in Europe which was compensated for by growth in emerging markets in the CEE, while Japan leveraged growth in other parts of Asia. Then came inflation, monetary tightening and a decline in risk appetite, so now even the emerging markets are slowing, So down we all go, I guess.\nTuesday, July 15, 2008\nAs predicted, the Bank of Japan ended its two day policy meeting with a holding operation. In its statement which, it has to be said, is relative brief the BOJ emphasised that significant downside is present with respect to the future course of domestic activity in the form of fixed capital formation and consumption. It was also interesting to note that the BOJ moved in with an indication that inflation pressures might abate in the coming months.\nEconomic growth is slowing further reflecting weaker growth in business fixed investment and private consumption against the backdrop of high energy and materials prices. While growth will likely remain slow for the time being, it is expected to gradually return onto a moderate growth path thereafter. CPI inflation rate (excluding fresh food) is currently around 1.5 percent due to increased prices of petroleum products and food. CPI inflation is expected to gradually moderate after becoming somewhat elevated in coming months. These suggest that the possibility of the economy remaining on a sustainable growth path with price stability is relatively high.\nAs Bloomberg's Mayumi Otsuma also latches on to it is the situation of stagflation lite which is pulling economic activity down. This was a theme I also noted in my recent in-depth look at Japan's economy. In general the risks for a raise in 2009 seems slim and as I noted recently it would take a marked and sustained increase in both core and headline inflation for this to materialise. Otsuma quotes research at JPMorgan Chase and Co. pointing towards a 13% chance/risk that the BOJ will raise come December.\nUltimately it looks like a solidified path of holding interest rates steady in Japan. In either direction it would take a sudden and large swing in fundamentals before the BOJ shifts its stance.\nFriday, July 11, 2008\nPrice rises for fuel and food have evidently badly dented the confidence of Japanese consumers, who after years of deflation had become accustomed to steady or slightly falling prices. Core consumer prices, which exclude those of fresh food but include energy, rose 1.5 percent in May, the biggest increase in 10 years.\nWages on the other hand have only grown lethargically, and were up a mere 0.2 percent in May, the slowest pace so far this year. The price of frequently purchased goods was up 2.4 percent in the same month, leading households to cut back spending at the fastest pace since September 2006.\nMonetary policy makers are often difficult to gauge, but looking forward to the BOJ meeting come next week (Monday and Tuesday) one thing seems fairly certain; the BOJ is going to hold off its guns yet again. That was also the conclusion reached by Bloomberg as they conducted a survey of 39 economists who unanimously called it a holding operation.\nOn the face of it the BOJ's dilemma is not so different from other central banks' in the sense that it is impossible to focus on growth and inflation at one and the same time. Yet, Japan is obviously a bit different since in this particular case there is the issue of continuing deflation in US style core prices while headline inflation is shooting up through the roof. For a visualization of the level form of price developments I can refer to my most recent assessment of the Japanese economy. What the graph below shows is the widening spread between the core-of-core price index (formally in deflation) and core price index.\nIt can easily be seen that this is not for the faint of heart and to make things worse wholesale inflation rose to a 27 year high in June. This suggests that a lot of inflation is creeping up through companies' supply and value chains. Now, there are arguments as to why we should not expect the link between wholesale and consumer prices to be particularly strong but it still confronts the BOJ with a set of quite un-welcome fundamentals.\nIn a slightly wider perspective it is quite interesting to witness the extent to which the BOJ's governing council under the charge of, the recently appointed, Masaaki Shirakawa basically has continued to tread the path laid out by Fukui. This would be the path then, on which extreme caution is exercised towards moving on rates in either direction. The interesting part of this is that Shirakawa was appointed as the main man of the BOJ, after a spectacle worthy to the annals of theatricals, in the expectation that he would hawkishly re-commence the very slow process of interest rate normalization in Japan. So far he and the rest of the council have been disappointing the hawks; that is, unless you take a whole new perspective of central bankers' propensity to gradualism.\nIn a more fundamental light the BOJ has simply recognized that the recovery is not on track and that the wisest road to take would be not to flog consumers (and companies) with increasing rates in the context of stagflation. More specifically, the ghost of deflation still lingers and I think it is safe to say that the BOJ is not inclined to risk increasing rates in order to combat inflation only to face the probability of re-introducing ZIRP. This would be a mirror image to the Bundesbank like attitude epitomized by the ECB and its recent preemptive move against inflation in a situation where the economic edifice is visibly crumbling. It is still too early to tell which of the global central banks that will emerge in the right. I think the BOJ is right not to push rates up but the current environment is not an easy one; that is for sure. Another thing which is making it a bit easier for the BOJ is the sudden abating of external pressures. In this way, it was only back in 2006 and beginning of 2007 that consecutive G8 meetings were ripe with comments to talk up the Yen and to push Japan to normalise rates more quickly. As a much welcome breather for the BOJ recent G8 meetings have not been concerned about the Yen but about the USD, the Fed's easing of monetary policy, and the inflationary nexus it represents as a result of USD pegging emerging markets.\nOne could however easily imagine the spotlight turning to Japan again at some point in the near future. In such a case and assuming that headline inflation continues to post accelerated increases it is not too difficult to see how the BOJ once again may be finding itself in a tight spot.\nIn the context of real economic fundamentals it is not very difficult to find ammunition for why the BOJ might want to hold off its plans to raise rates. I have an overview here as well as Edward provides additional pointers with his most recent write up on exports. The only bright spot was the impressive surge in machinery orders which provide pretty strong grounds for corporate capex in the immediate future. In a recent speech, governor Shirakawa also emphasised the risks to the economy. In particular, he made the following point in the context of terms of trade which is important to latch on to ...\n\"The deterioration in the terms of trade that results from rises in energy and materials prices leads to an outflow of real income, as Japan depends heavily on imported resources. This exerts downward pressure on corporate profits and reduces households' purchasing power. Although business fixed investment and private consumption remain firm, due attention should be paid to the possibility that the weakening of the economy's capacity to generate income will result in weaker domestic private demand.\"\nNow, at this point I would be understanding if readers are a little bit confused. As such and if terms of trade deterioration is the main problem would it not make sense to raise rates to pump up the currency and thus increase the purchasing power? Perhaps ... but we should remember that this only works if demand responds appropriately. If it does not you might end up, in Japan's case, to push the domestic economy into deflation. Moreover and since Japan is highly dependent on exports to grow this is also a double edged sword since an increasing currency to mitigate terms of trade would also hurt companies' competitiveness; even if many would argue that the current value of the Yen would merit this.\nOn the specifics of monetary policy Shirakawa notes the reluctance of the BOJ to pre-commit;\n\"As I have explained, the outlook for economic activity and prices is highly uncertain at present. In this situation, the Bank considers that it is not appropriate to predetermine the direction of future monetary policy. Based on a thorough examination of the economic and price situation as well as the market situation both at home and abroad, the Bank will carefully assess the future outlook for economic activity and prices, closely considering the likelihood of its projections as well as relevant risk factors, and will implement its policies in a flexible manner.\"\nThis is basically central bank speak for \"on hold\" and would be very weary of calling a move either direction throughout the rest of 2008. For the chart hungry the BOJ's June report on the economic development is the place to go. It basically reiterates all the main points touched above. Japan will continue growing albeit at a slower pace which is going to be determined by the extent to which exports will continue to expand. Prices provide a risk but against the sharp backdrop of consumer spending and domestic activity this latter point is where the focus is.\nThe Perpetual Holding Position?\nAnything short of cataclysmic events point towards the BOJ holding rates during the meeting next week. So, isn't this just the easiest job in the world being a BOJ watcher? At the moment it certainly seems to be quite an automatic exercise in terms of the direction of policy; quite simply there does not seem to be one which translates into a solidified holding operation. A couple of events however might wrestle the BOJ out of their current stance; in either direction.\n- One would be a return of inflation in core-of-core prices. I have argued (see links above) why I think this is unlikely but given that fact that the US style core index is running at \"only\" -0.1% it is not impossible to imagine a return to inflation. In such a scenario and given the current focus from investors and international policy makers on inflation it could prompt the BOJ to raise. I think however that it would take something in the region of three month's consecutive positive and increasing reading before such a move be considered.\n- Another event which could provide some action is a return of the focus on Japan as the main global liquidity anchor. This would be a return then to the days of 2006 and beginning of 2007 where Japan and its currency were the main talk of the town. If the economic fundamentals continue to deteriorate at the steady pace most analysts expect I have a hard time seeing the BOJ being bullied into raising rates. However, it would serve investors well to remember that what brought the BOJ to 0.5% in the first place was actually the very same pressure from G8 that I am suggesting will return. Edward Hugh's note at the time provides an excellent overview of the situation.\n- Finally, we should not dismiss the possibility that things take a turn for the worse and to such an extent that the BOJ be forced to lower rates, perhaps even reintroducing ZIRP. In a world where inflation is perceived the main culprit for the incoming economic ills such a move won't be easily wringed by the BOJ. One thing which could prompt such a scenario is the the solidification of deflation in core-of-core prices. As with the mirror situation described above I think it would take a marked deterioration in domestic inflation and demand dynamics before the BOJ considers this. At this point it is very difficult to gauge where the market discourse goes in the future. One could then easily imagine that fears of growth will return to the market in which case the BOJ's ability to sneak back into ZIRP will be eased.\nThursday, July 10, 2008\nExports to the U.S. fell 9.5 percent and shipments to Europe slid 1.1 percent, the first drop since October 2005. Exports to Asia were up 8.1 percent from a year earlier, and those to China gained 12.3 percent, led by shipments of steel, automobiles and oil products. Japan's refiners sent extra fuel to China as part of relief efforts following the May 12 earthquake that killed more than 69,000 people.\nShipments to Russia, the world's biggest exporter of oil and gas, soared 58.8 percent year on year last month, while those to Vietnam were up 40.3%, to India 53.3%, Indonesia 30.4%, and Brazil 24.2%.\nWednesday, July 09, 2008\nOrders from the steel industry surged 131 percent, and for electrical machinery climbed 34 percent while demand for equipment used to make cars fell 3.3 percent. Today's reading can be seen tpo some extent as a reaction to declines in February and March, when orders dropped 12.3 percent and 8.3 percent, but the profit squeeze caused by higher oil costs without real price leverage may well prompt companies to once more cut spending in the coming months.\nOverseas orders were up 21.1% from a 4.6% rate of increase in April. This may indicate that June exports could \"bounce up\" a little bit.\nTuesday, July 08, 2008\nThe Economy Watchers index - a survey of barbers, taxi drivers and others who serve the general public directly was down again in June, falling to 29.5 (a six year low)from 32.1 in May, according to data from the Cabinet Office today. The forward looking index for conditions in two to three months time slid to 32.1, its worst reading since September 2001 (down from 35.1. in May).\nObviously the combination of rising food and energy prices and pressure on wages is now hitting people. A record 88.9 percent of those interviews expected prices to rise over the next 12 months according to last week's Bank of Japan survey, while an unprecedented 58.7 percent said they were going to cut spending. Again this is not particularly surprising since the latest data show that wages only were up 0.2 percent year on year in May, while the prices of the most frequently purchased products grew 2.4 percent.\nSunday, July 06, 2008\nJapan is still hanging on it seems, but for how long? This is what I will try to clarify in this entry. In the following I will thus continue my ongoing analysis on two months' worth of data as well as loads of timely analysis from other sources where, as usual, Ken Worsley and Takehiro Sato/Feldman from Morgan Stanley have my complete attention. In accordance with tradition four overall themes will form the backbone of the analysis; trends in prices, domestic demand figures, industrial output/exports, and finally the JPY which as ever is the subject of much attention in currency markets and beyond.\nWhen it comes to prices it could seem as if Japan's quick return to inflation in the core-of-core index was nothing more than a blip. As can consequently be observed from the graph below Japan is once again stuck in deflation measured by the core index stripped of energy and food input; both April and May thus saw a decline in US style core prices of -0.1%.\nThe graph above also recounts the story of global stagflation with Japan as perspective. Thus, while core-of-core inflation remains in deflation the core general inflation index has shot up on the back of global headline inflation pressures. As will be described below this is obviously having a non-negliable effect on an already lackluster Japanese consumer. More generally, I have been emphasizing this chasm between core and headline inflation for quite some time as well as I have been pointing out that inflation in Japan was solely of a cost-push nature rather than demand-pull.\nIndeed, the whole discussion of \"spill-over effects\" in Japan and how activity in one part of the economy (corporate capex/exports) would automatically lead to an increase in domestic demand seems now to have finally been laid to rest. This is a welcome structural break in the discourse as pundits and analysts have been waiting for these positive spill-over effects ever since the BOJ chose to end ZIRP back in 2006. So far this exercise is almost remnisient of that famous play by Samuel Beckett. A clear sign that a structural break has occurred in the analytical discourse comes from the recent writings by Morgan Stanley's Takehiro Sato and not least this specific note in which he splendidly argues the case that headline inflation pressures won't necessarily spill over into core inflation.\nThe idea that cost-push inflation can lead to a reflation story appears to rest on the belief that expanding corporate margins fed by price hikes can allow depressed real wage levels to recover. However, for non-durable goods we cannot expect a powerful volume boost from a consumption spurt even if prices rise, and if sales volumes are slumping corporate earnings would presumably come under pressure. The household survey data for January-March in fact show that real expenditure on items for which prices have risen (mayonnaise, canned seafood, bread, instant noodles) fell across the board.\nI would be hard pressed to deliver the argument more succinctly. There are two important points here. First of all we have the point that no matter how far up those mayonnaise prices have to go it won't likely lead to front loading of expenditures. I completely agree with Sato when he argues that rising food and energy prices won't lead to hoarding (well, gas perhaps but that is hazardous). In fact, and if my readers will dare venture back to econ 101 (if possible) the cross-price elasticity of such products with respect to other goods/services will be high meaning that as headline inflation graps hold demand for these will fall. This is especially the case when real income growth is flat trending to negative.\nHowever, cost-push inflation as a concept is not of course limited to headline inflation. This brings us to the second point. It is by now well known that input/wholesale prices are rising across the board in Japan but while these pressures are finding the consumer in the form of elevated energy and food prices it is not, to any significant degree, finding its way to consumers in the form of goods such as durables, textiles etc. This tells us an important story about the price and demand dynamics in Japan. As Robert Alan Feldman put it at some point; there is something funny about Japanese consumption. This \"funny feeling\", if you will forgive me my pun, has something to do with the demographics of Japan and how the capacity for mustering demand pull inflation is simply not there to any significant extent. This also finally means that inflation pressures will have a tendency to clog up in the value chain as companies find it difficult to pass on wholesale price increases to consumers, and the extent to which they do; it will have a very direct impact on consumption figures.\nSpeaking of which it seems that the Japanese consumer has now finally succumbed to the pressures of headline inflation rolling in over the shores of Japan. The visual inspection tells a clear story then.\nThe Japanese consumer put in an unexpectedly strong showing in the first months of 2008 which was also a contributing factor in presenting a more than respectable Q1 GDP figure (although exports as ever accounted for the lion's share). In April and May consumption however accelerated its decline with -2.7% and -3.2% y-o-y respectively. Anything short of a veritable summer shopping frenzy in June will mean that consumption is likely to be a significant drag on GDP in Q2. As per usual Ken Worsley is watching incoming consumption data like a hawk. Judged by his account especially May seem to have been a tough month for Japanese retailers et al. Further snippets provide break downs in terms of supermarket sales which fell 1.1% in May as well as nationwide department store sales falling 2.7%. Japanese consumers are quite literally cutting back across the board, both in terms of spending on food and gasoline but also in terms of services. Spending on durable goods rose in May after three months of consecutive decline.\nIn terms of the outlook it seems as if consumer confidence in Japan can only go one way at the moment. With an index running at 33.9 points it stands at a five time lows close to the all time low marked in 2001 at 33 points. The plight of the Japanese consumer is understandable but also worrying. It is understandable because the current bout of stagflation is sure to pinch consumers across the global economic edifice but the speed and rate of pessimism and drop in real activity is quite severe in Japan. In terms of overall demand dynamics it tells an important story about the ability of Japan to shield itself from what comes next in terms of a slowdown in exports and industrial production. One thing is sure in this regard. Even if Japanese employers increasingly are beginning to convert part time workers into full time workers the increase in wages cannot, and not by a long shot, keep up with the pace of headline inflation pressures.\nTurning to the corporate sector and thus the important data point of industrial production Japanese companies surprised us with a strong showing in May. For good measure the graph below does not include May figures as the index I track for these analyses lag the one reported by Edward linked above.\nThe graph is still instructive I think. Industry activity as a whole is now decisively situated on one of those famous plateaus. Moreover, the tendency seems to be one of decline. The important point here is not that industrial production and corporate capex will plummet but more so that the very impressive readings from the latter part of 2007 will be replaced by a more moderate growth clip. In a Japanese context this is significant since the nexus of industrial production and exports is so vital to keep the economy from stagnation or outright recession.\nAs with the consumption sector the outlook for corporate activity is increasingly looking weaker by the day. Business confidence declined to the lowest in four years on the back of surging commodity tests. Moreover, the widely watched Tankan survey for June, see Takehiro Sato for preview and background, confirmed that momentum is winding down significantly in Japan's industrial sector. Especially companies' expectations of profits deteriorated markedly with companies expecting profits to decline 7% in the coming quarter (Q3).\nYet, not only from an accounting perspective are Japanese companies beginning to sail into dire straits. Judged by the recent performance of Japanese equities the extent of downsizing in terms of value destruction/discounting is quite extensive.\nIt should be immediately noted of course that global equities in general seem to be facing much more lackluster times having decisively left the bull pen to go into the woods searching for the bear. However, the recent days' performance of the Nikkei 225 are breaking all kinds of scary records. Interestingly and as an important differentiation to the whole debate on decoupling it seems as especially the incoming slowdown in emerging markets (China and India) is having an effect.\nIn essence, it seems as if Japanese companies, like the consumer, are getting pinched at the moment. If global momentum continues to deteriorate we should expect headline industrial capex figures to exhibit considerable relative weakness in the months and quarters to come.\nOn a more structural note and even though it is formally unrelated I could not help but feel vindicated by the recent news from the political scene that the government is considering a tax cut aimed at companies to boost their competitiveness. Now, whenever the debate on fiscal policy in Japan homes in on tax cuts it is sure to send shivers down the backs of officials in the ministry of finance. As such, with a debt/gdp ratio running at about 170% you don't just dole out tax cuts without having a plan to raise taxes in another place. And if you do, those feathers provided by recent debt rating upgrades may soon be ruffled.\nIn other words, we are talking about the fine art of redistributive policy. In this specific context I got that familiar feeling of deja-vu when it transpired from Bloomberg's report that the government would, or was contemplating to, finance tax cuts by imposing sales and income taxes. It is of course never that simple, and while Japan's government may simply be responding to sound advice from the OECD this discourse of easing the tax burden for companies by tightening fiscal policy in the context of consumers is not new in Japan.\nIt is important to understand then that the extent to which consumption is taxed as a way to ease conditions of companies will only solidify the growth path onto which Japan is now situated. I don't believe that this is a question of one or the other but I do think it is important that policy makers (and investors) are aware of the consequences. Whether the lowering of corporate tax rates will lead to a marked increase in FDI is debatable I think. The channel by which such investments would flow to Japan would not, I think, be based on the exploitation of a buoyant domestic market. However, if Japan can succeed (and in many ways this is a fait accomplit) in becoming one of the main links to the Indian and Chinese growth history, FDI could be expected to come in on this account. This would then be the kind of FDI which promotes export activities.\nShifting gears and turning to the external sector and the JPY a couple of interesting developments have emerged since we last convened. In a world of (largely) free flows of capital it is only natural that the currency of the third biggest economy commands much attention not least because of the extraordinarily low relative yield (0.5%) it carries. Below is a chart of the major Yen crosses as an index with the beginning of 2006 as the initial value (100).\nIt can easily be observed how the JPY depreciated steadily up until August 2007 after which the credit turmoil grabbed hold. Especially the USD/JPY has seen its value spike due to a depreciation of the USD but also the NZD/JPY has seen a correction. As regards the JPY (and to some extent the CHF as the other \"low-yielder\") there are two major themes for investors to watch out for; both of which I have elaborated on extensively. To distinguish between the two it is fruitful to think of one representing fundamentals and one representing market sentiment.\nThe latter theme is well known by market participants and FX punters; in the context of my own analysis I even made a paper out of it which shows how JPY and CHF crosses, since the credit turmoil, have acted as very finely tuned risk sentiment gauges in the market place. This was epitomized by the spring market action where turmoil surrounding Bear Sterns and other juicy events brought the Yen as high as to 95 to the USD on the back of \"perceived\" unwinding of carry trade positions. More specifically, I also show in my paper that the negative relationship between low-yielding currencies and risk (as measure by stock market indices) is very fine tuned indeed even to such an extent that the negative correlation can be tracked on a daily return basis. Yet, correlations rarely hold over an indefinite time span and one should at least expect correlations to exhibit variations in terms of strength. This is certainly true with the correlation noted above as we saw recently how the correlation between the USD/JPY and SP500 broke out of range.\nThis brings us to the second theme and one which we could then label fundamentals. Under this narrative lies the fact that with an interest rate of 0.5% as well as an economy characterised by export dependence money will have a strong propensity to flow out in search for yield. Such a process and subsequent decline in home bias will also quite naturally put an effective floor for the appreciation of the domestic currency. In fact, over time one would expect the currency to depreciate steadily on the back of such outflows. Various versions of carry trade will have the same effect of course.\nAs always there is a demand as well as a supply side here. The interesting thing is that it is difficult to see just where one begins and the other ends. One narration of the market would then be to see Japanese savers as the demand side and the rest of the world's yield as supply. This theme which encapsulates the need for an ageing economy to earn asset income from outside its borders to fuel growth (export dependence remember) was described in my recent post on how Japanese savings are going for yield. Another way would be to turn the tables and narrate the pool of Japanese savings as the supply side and foreign investors not to mention asset managers as the demand side. In this way, an abundance of capital and a 0.5% interest rate provide strong incentive for asset managers and companies to seek out funds in Japan. The surge in the sale of samurai bonds would be a case in point here.\nWhatever way we choose to look at this it is imperative that investors and analysts alike consider both the effects cited above. As for immediate forecasts on the JPY, there seems to have been a structural break. It appears then that the recent turn for worse in equity markets have not prompted the JPY to hurry back towards Spring's high levels. In stead, the fundamental story is taking over as forecasters across the board are now predicting the USD/JPY to move towards 115 which interesting was about the same value I marked out for 2008. Up until this point the risk sentiment argument seemed to have thoroughly proven me wrong but now it is perhaps time to pull out the idea of a USD/JPY back in pre-credit turmoil 115-120s?\nEnd of the Line for Japan?\nHow to connect the dots then? In the text above I mention the Samuel Beckett and his existentialist play Waiting for Godot in which Estragon and Vladimir attempts to pass time as they wait for Godot to arrive. Quite a tough one to sit out in the theater I have to say, and so has it been with my continuing recession call for Japan. It is certain then that the GDP performance churned out in Q4 07 and Q1 08 have resembled anything but recession. Yet, Japanese GDP figures are notoriously volatile (and thus inconclusive in the big picture) whereas indicators such as industrial production are more solid.\nMore generally, as Edward put it recently indicators from the Japanese economy are now showing weakness everywhere. In this framework it is difficult to escape the fact that Japan, if not heading for one, will be flirting with recession in the quarters to come. I am not pulling this out of thin air either. Leafing through the analyses by Japan watchers will also confirm that the R-word is being used with more regularity than only a months ago. What is significant I think is that the Japanese consumer now decisively seems to have thrown in the towel suffering under the yoke of stagflation. What remains is then corporate capex/industrial production which should not contract as such but grow at a much slower pace. This need not push Japan into a recession but it definitely means that momentum is heading down.\nAs regards monetary policy I think I need to devote a separate piece to really get down to business. However, and while many expected the new governor Masaaki Shirakawa to be of the hawkish pedigree he has so far not been able to steer the BOJ away from its perpetual holding position. The BOJ will not, it seems, lift rates as long as core-of-core prices are in negative territory and to the other side the situation is not deemed seriously enough to re-introduce ZIRP. This latter option would also most definitely test the newly found G8 stance against inflation and at this point I think the BOJ is quite happy staying out of the limelight.\nI dare not call it a recession in Japan just yet but I will say that the signs are mounting that Q2 will mark a structural break in headline GDP figures for Japan. The key as always is industrial production and exports and the extent to which activity can be kept at a pace to compensate the obvious slump in domestic demand.\nTuesday, July 01, 2008\nHouseholds cut back their spending at the fastest pace since September 2006 in May, as inflation surged to a decade high. A weakening job market has also helped push consumer sentiment to a six-year low as consumers face higher energy and food prices.\nManufacturers worked fewer hours in the month, which reduced their overtime pay and the overall wage figure, according to Shunichi Ando, head of the Labor Ministry's statistics division. Overtime hours at manufacturers fell 3.9 percent in May, not far from the 4.1 percent drop in April, the biggest decline in six years.\nThe full-time workforce grew by 1.7 percent, slower than April's 2 percent increase, while the number of part-timers was up 1.7 percent from 1.2 percent in April. Slowing factory output prompted the government to downgrade its assessment of production for the first time in six months in May. Industrial production fell in March and April.\nThe Tankan index of manufacturer sentiment which was also published this morning confirmed this general negative impression, with the idex sliding to 5 points in June from 11 in March. This was a third quarterly decline, the Bank of Japan said today in Tokyo. Large companies forecast profits would drop 7 percent in the year ending March 31, compared with a 0.3 percent increase predicted three months ago.\nThe yen traded at 106.10 per dollar as of 12:40 p.m. in Tokyo from 106.15 before the report. Japan's currency has now weakened 4 percent against the dollar since the previous Tankan on April 1.", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}

{"id": "2013", "text": "Channel Strategy Session: Applied Innovation Maximizing Its Full Potential\nMega dealer seeks greater balance between managed IT services and print\nBe sure to follow us on LinkedIn!\nIt’s been over 18 months since Applied Innovation became exactly that: Applied Innovation. Two years after the COVID-19 pandemic struck, with product and service diversification in the channel on full display like cherry blossoms in DC, the mega dealer decided a name change was in order. Applied Imaging no longer told the whole story—no, that needed to have managed IT services (MITS) represented as well as everything else not under the print umbrella.\nHumans love to talk about potential. The potential of students entering college or graduates entering the workforce. The potential of athletes who get drafted higher than those with better skills at the current time. The potential of publicly traded companies. And it was this very thing, this word, this concept that grabbed me by the collar (total hyperbole, I rarely wear collared shirts) and hollered while I recently spoke with Casey Lowery, President of Applied Innovation.\nDuring our half hour together, he said the organization not only had its best year financially in 2023 but did so in all business units. The Michigan-based dealer went from $118 million in 2022 to $157 million last year (Applied’s fiscal year ends in September). That’s an increase of roughly 25%—in part due to deferred revenue that was efficiently fulfilled, but more so thanks to strong organic growth. Applied Innovation acquired four dealers during the first year of the pandemic and have bought three more since, too.\nYet, with approximately 88% of the company’s annual revenue stemming from print, that remaining, smaller percentage was of more interest to me: the managed IT services (MITS) portion. And you don’t need to be an analyst or a mathematician to figure out that Applied can hit a 50/50 split of print/MITS if it realizes 38% growth in the latter. The “glass half empty” guy might classify that as your standard piano-on-the-back-sort-of lift, but the “glass half full” guy sees potential. Excitement. Something…new.\n“One of our acquisitions in the past few years was for an IT firm,” Lowery said. “We’re more interested in IT, though we’d never rule out another print acquisition if the opportunity felt right. Right now, anything that fits into the parameters of the broad business continuity space, that’s where we’re at. Leads come in, and many of them are because of managed IT services. Around 22% of our 2023 revenue was due to net-new accounts, and many of those are because of IT.”\nThere are 18 mega dealers in the United States. Applied Innovation is a card-carrying member and shows no sign of slowing down. With so much potential around managed IT services and everything else beyond print, including digital transformation (DX) and artificial intelligence (AI), would anyone doubt them? I’m pretty sure the company will steamroll toward the $200 million clip before you know it, but I am definitely sure the company will not be changing its name again anytime soon.\nBrowse through our Industry Reports page (latest reports only).

{"id": "2132", "text": "What do a refrigerator door and a high-rise have in common? Material. They may both be stainless steel.\nStainless steel fabricators produce components for cookware, home appliances, surgical tools, medical implants, bridges, and automotive bodies. Many of our most memorable landmarks are also made of stainless steel—take the Gateway Arch in St. Louis, The Bean in Chicago’s Millennium Park, or the spires on the United States Air Force Memorial in Arlington.\nChromium is the key to producing stainless steel, a metal known for its unique properties. All stainless steels contain a minimum of 10.5% chromium, which forms a thin passive layer on the steel’s surface when exposed to oxygen. There are several grades of stainless steel with varying amounts of chromium content.\n1. Corrosion-Resistant Steel\nStainless steel’s biggest superpower is its corrosion resistance. Due to its chromium content, stainless steel is naturally resistant to rust and corrosion.\nA passive layer of chromium oxide clings to the steel’s surface and protects the iron within from air, water, and other contaminants. The chromium oxide layer is also self-healing. Damaged or scratched stainless steel will repair itself in the presence of oxygen, which is why stainless steel remains shiny after years of use.\nIncreasing stainless steel’s chromium content increases its corrosion resistance. Low alloyed stainless steels can withstand atmospheric conditions, but high alloyed stainless steels can also resist corrosion from acids and alkaline solutions.\nFamilies of Stainless Steel & Their Chromium Content\n- Austenitic stainless steel is the most commonly used type of stainless steel and the toughest—with around 18% chromium.\n- Ferritic stainless steels are not as resistant to corrosion as their austenitic counterparts. They are made with 12 to 17% chromium.\n- Martensitic stainless steels are made with only 11 to 17% chromium.\n- Duplex stainless steels have a high amount of chromium—anywhere from 18 to 28%. Duplex stainless steels feature a microstructure of equal ferrite and austenite, so they display properties of both austenitic and ferritic steels.\n2. Easy to Fabricate\nWorkability is the next characteristic that makes stainless steel a practical choice for fabrication. Manipulating stainless steel can be done fairly easily with the right tools and know-how. Stainless steel is easy to cut, bend, weld, and form as desired.\nNickel deserves the credit for our ability to easily make custom components from stainless steel. Not all stainless steels contain nickel, but 75% of the stainless steel we produce includes this alloy. The nickel content within stainless steel changes its structure to an austenitic structure at all temperatures.\nThe austenitic structure improves nickel-containing stainless steel’s ductility and formability, and it makes these stainless steels readily weldable. Higher nickel contents are better for deep drawing.\n3. Pleasing Aesthetics\nShiny. Bright. Low-maintenance. Stainless steel is an attractive metal that retains its beauty over time. Once installed, stainless steel does not need to be treated, coated, or painted to maintain its appearance.\nYou can give stainless steel a wide variety of finishes, including matte, brushed, satin polished, bright polished, or mirror finish. Patterned finishes are also possible for building entrance flooring, roofing, and automotive exhaust systems.\n4. Long Lifespan\nStainless steel lasts a long time. According to a 2015 study, the average lifespan of stainless steel is 20 years. At the end of its life, stainless steel can be recycled to make new stainless steel or carbon steel.\nYale University research scientist Barbara Reck found that most stainless steel is used to produce metal goods (29.4%) and industrial machinery (29.4%). These end products are followed by building materials (18.4%), car components (12.2%), household appliances (7.8%), and parts for other forms of transportation (2.9%).\nThe study found that stainless steel used for buildings and infrastructure lasts 50 years on average. Metal goods and household appliances made of stainless steel last about 15 years.\nThe lifespan and durability of stainless steel outweigh the initial cost of the material. Stainless steel has a higher price per unit compared to mild steel, but less material is usually needed to complete projects because of its properties.\nMaterial selection plays into the final fabrication cost. As global markets continue to recover from COVID-19, stainless steel raw material costs will fluctuate. As of March 2022, these raw materials are projected to increase in price.\n5. Temperature Resistant\nStainless steel can take the heat. It has resistance to extreme temperatures. That’s why boilers and water valves are often made from stainless steel. At high temperatures, stainless steel resists scaling and creep. Some grades of stainless steel can be used for temperatures up to 2100℉.\nEven in lower temperatures, stainless steel remains tough. Austenitic stainless steels are often used for products exposed to subzero temperatures. Grades 304 and 316 are considered “cryogenic steels” because of their ability to retain tensile strength and ductility in extreme cold.\nStainless steel is commonplace in hospitals, kitchens, and food processing plants because it is easy to clean. Due to its natural resistance, stainless steel doesn’t impart contaminants from corrosion onto products, and its shiny surface makes it simple to sanitize again and again.\nAccording to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), materials that come into contact with food must not contaminate the food or alter its taste or color. The Food Safety Modernization Act was created to prevent food-borne illnesses. Grades 304, 316, and 430 are used by companies that process and package food.\nAround 50% of new United States stainless steel is made from remelted scrap metal. Stainless steel is completely recyclable. In fact, about 85% of stainless steel is recycled at the end of its life.\nOld stainless steel can be used to produce new metals, which is one reason stainless steel is so valuable. Of the stainless steel that’s recycled, 56% is used to make new stainless steel, and 29% is used to produce new carbon steel. In the United States, the average amount of recycled content in stainless steel is 71%.\nWhen you choose stainless steel, you know the material will have a lifespan long past the lifespan of your product.\nCustom Stainless Steel Fabrication\nStainless steel is perfect for components that need resistance from rust and corrosion but still need to look the part. Its aesthetics make stainless steel desirable for exterior car parts and home appliances. For industries that rely on sanitary surfaces, stainless steel is hygienic and easy to disinfect as required.\nThough stainless steel has a greater initial cost, its unique properties and benefits make it a worthy investment that will stand the test of time.\nRequest a quote today for your next stainless steel fabrication project.

{"id": "2141", "text": "OAN’s Abril Elfi\n4:40 PM – Wednesday, January 10, 2024\nSpeaker of the House Mike Johnson has criticized both President Joe Biden and New York City Mayor Eric Adams in relation to the rising migrant crisis.\nOn Wednesday, Johnson (R-La.) blasted the president’s administration and Adams (D-N.Y.) after Brooklyn high school students were forced to vacate the classroom and go fully remote as the migrants took over their campus.\n“This week, Secretary Mayorkas confirmed that 85% of the illegal immigrants who are apprehended at the border are released into the interior United States,” Johnson said. “Now, because of the administration’s policy choices, students and teachers are having to turn to remote learning in order to accommodate illegal immigrants at their school. From the president on down to city mayors, support for illegal immigration has trickled down, thereby prioritizing the needs of non-citizens over the needs of our own.”\n“If Biden and Mayorkas refuse to reverse course and secure the southern border, our students and schools will continue to pay the price for the administration’s abdication of duty,” Johnson added.\nNearly 2,000 undocumented migrants were advised to flee from a large tent shelter and were moved to a second-floor gym at James Madison High School, which is located five miles away from the shelter. There was a fear that the “large migrant tent at Floyd Bennett Field might collapse” due to heavy rain and wind.\n“House Republicans have solutions: we passed the Schools Not Shelters Act in July to ensure schools serve as sanctuaries of study, not casualties of sanctuary cities,” Johnson also said. “Sadly, President Biden threatened to veto the bill.”\nAll of the migrants had been removed from the school by Wednesday at 4:30 a.m., an evacuation that sources called “madness.” Despite the migrants vacating the premise, students were still expected to participate in virtual classes the next day.\nJust after midnight, Adams uploaded pictures of the 1,900 migrants spread out on the gym floor on X, praising the work being done by city officials to keep “asylum seekers safe and dry before they depart tomorrow morning.”\nStay informed!

{"id": "2162", "text": "Childcare cleaning checklist: Maintain a clean childcare centre\nCleaning a daycare centre is a difficult task. There is barely any time to do a deep cleaning and children come in almost every day. There are simply way too many factors in play to consider before carrying out a full-fledged clean-up. This is why having a daycare itinerary for childcare cleaning in Sydney that helps you track and accomplish every task may be quite beneficial. When working with delicate and susceptible needs, it’s best to have a well-thought-out plan in mind before beginning the method.\nThis will keep you from missing any deadlines and ensure that your facility is well-maintained from beginning to end. Because we are working with infants and toddlers, childcare facilities are one of the venues that require a well-curated strategy and are very well implemented\nAmong other things, there are specific things that you should attend to in your daily routine. In a perfect world, your regular cleaning process would include total basal treatment with no exclusions. It’s also a good idea to go over the complete regimen with each surface cleaned to verify that germs don’t build up in the long run. Here’s a checklist of things for your daily cleaning.\nBe sure to carry out at least one round of brooming and surface-level dusting to keep the place clean. If this is not done daily, it can build up dust and grime over a long period of time. Along with dusting, wiping the surfaces with a disinfectant is also a good idea. Along with regular cleaning, the organisation of items can also help in keeping a place clean. With better organisation, you will be able to maintain a hygienic environment.\nYou should go a little deeper into your daycare janitorial services at least about once every 7 days. The most period of time you must give any final thing on your facilities to incubate is seven days. Even your soft toys should be washed on a regular basis.\nAll fluffy toys, stuffed animals, and other common utility items that do not have wash limitations should be washed or wiped off. Reorganize and clean all of your cabinet spaces before restocking them. Disinfect all challenging spots and wash cribs. Cleanse all of the linens as needed. These are some of the things that are quintessential when it comes to daycare cleaning Sydney.\nAt least once a month, you should prioritise the clogging systems and the drains. Your daycare cleaning should be evaluated on a monthly basis in order to perfect the method over time.

People wear so many masks; it becomes difficult to judge their intentions particularly when you are not fully acquainted with them. Politeness is important for creating, developing and maintaining relationships. However if you are slightly dishonest in your politeness, people will find it out and will not trust you. Dishonesty in politeness means you have some other motto in your mind which is in contrast with your words. It means your speech and actions are not synchronised.\nThere are people who are honest in heart but do not know how to be polite. Such people face difficulty in connecting with others. For politeness best instrument is smile. Though it is such a simple expression but some people fail to bring it on face. Polite people normally rehearse the words and reframe before they shoot them out.

Try one of our generic alternatives today and experience the same results as the brand name option. You won't be disappointed!\nWhy Look for Generic Alternatives?\nSave Money Without Sacrificing Quality\nIf you're looking for a more affordable option for Levitra, generic alternatives may be the solution you need. Although they are not branded, they contain the same active ingredient (vardenafil) as the original medication, ensuring its effectiveness.\nGoing for generics can save you up to 80% of the price of the original brand, without sacrificing quality. They still follow the same guidelines by the FDA and other regulating bodies, ensuring their safety and efficacy in treating erectile dysfunction.\nMore Availability for Your Needs\nOne of the downsides of branded Levitra is that it may not be readily available in some countries or regions. Generic alternatives, on the other hand, are widely available in many online pharmacies and drugstores around the world.\nNot only that, but you may also find more options and varieties of vardenafil-based medications in generics than in the original brand. This gives you more options to choose the best medication that suits your needs, budget, and lifestyle.\nGet the Same Effects and Benefits\nPerhaps the greatest advantage of generic Levitra alternatives is that they work just as well as the original brand. They contain the same active ingredient, undergo the same strict manufacturing standards, and deliver the same results in treating erectile dysfunction.\nWhether you choose the original or generic option, you can expect to enjoy the same benefits of improved erections, enhanced sexual performance, and boosted confidence in your sex life. So why pay more for a branded medication when you can get the same results for less with a generic alternative?\nThe Top Levitra Generic Alternatives Available\nIf you are looking for the best Levitra generic alternative, Vilitra is a great choice. It contains Vardenafil, the same active ingredient as Levitra, but at a much lower cost. This medication comes in different strengths, allowing you to choose the one that’s most suitable for your needs. You can take Vilitra with or without food, and you should take it about an hour before you plan to have sex.\nVilitra has been proven to be effective in treating erectile dysfunction, helping men achieve and maintain an erection for longer. It is also safe and well-tolerated, with relatively few side effects. Your doctor can advise you on the best Vilitra dose for you based on your medical history and other medications you may be taking.\nAnother Levitra generic alternative worth considering is Snovitra. It also contains Vardenafil, but it is manufactured by a different company, which means that it may be available at a lower price. Snovitra comes in different strengths and forms, including tablets and oral jelly.\nLike Vilitra, Snovitra is an effective treatment for erectile dysfunction, helping men to achieve and maintain an erection. It has a similar safety profile to Levitra, with few side effects. However, it is important to follow the recommended dosage and not to exceed it, as it may increase the risk of side effects.\nZenegra is another generic alternative to Levitra that contains Sildenafil, a different active ingredient. It works by relaxing the blood vessels in the penis and increasing blood flow, allowing men to achieve and maintain an erection. Zenegra is a more affordable option than Levitra, but it may not be as effective for everyone.\nZenegra should be taken about an hour before sexual activity, and you should not take it more than once a day. It may cause side effects such as headache, nausea, or dizziness, but these are usually mild and go away on their own. Your doctor can advise you on whether Zenegra is a suitable treatment for your erectile dysfunction.\n- If you are looking for a top-quality Levitra generic alternative, consider Vilitra, Snovitra, or Zenegra.\n- These medications contain similar active ingredients to Levitra, but they are more affordable.\n- Talk to your doctor to find out which one is the best option for you.\nHow to Choose the Right Generic Alternative for You\nWhen it comes to choosing a generic alternative for Levitra, it can be overwhelming with all the options available. However, with a little research and understanding of your needs, you can make an informed decision that best suits you.\nDetermine your Dosage\nBefore choosing a generic alternative, it is important to determine the dosage that works best for you. Levitra is available in 4 dosages - 2.5mg, 5mg, 10mg, and 20mg. Consult your doctor to determine the dosage that is right for your specific needs.\nResearch the Brand\nOnce you have determined your dosage, research the different generic brands available. Check to see if they are FDA approved and read customer reviews to see their experiences and effectiveness of the brand.\nComparing prices between different generic alternatives can help you save money. Check different online pharmacies and compare prices for the dosage and brand you have chosen. Be sure to factor in shipping costs and any discounts or promotions offered.\nSpeak with your Doctor\nIt is always important to speak with your doctor before starting any new medication. They can provide guidance and answer any questions you may have about the generic alternative you have chosen.\nRemember, choosing the right generic alternative for you requires careful consideration and research. By taking these steps, you can find the best option that suits your needs and budget.\nBenefits of Choosing Generic Alternatives\nGeneric alternatives are typically a more affordable option compared to their brand-name counterparts. This is because generic medications do not have the same research and development costs that brand-name medications have. You can save a significant amount of money by choosing a generic alternative.\nGeneric medications must meet the same standards for quality, safety, and effectiveness as brand-name medications. In fact, the FDA requires that generic medications contain the same active ingredients at the same strength as their brand-name counterparts. Choosing a generic alternative does not mean sacrificing quality.\nGeneric alternatives are widely available in pharmacies, both online and offline. This means you can easily find the medication you need without hassle or delay.\nGeneric alternatives are available for a wide variety of medications. This means you have more options when it comes to choosing a medication that works for you. You can compare prices and select the best medication for your budget and needs.\nGeneric alternatives are trusted by millions of patients worldwide. They have a proven track record of safety and efficacy. You can rest assured that you are getting a medication that is effective and safe.\nConsidering the many benefits of choosing generic alternatives, it is easy to see why they are becoming an increasingly popular option for patients.

{"id": "2251", "text": "Mental exercises to build (or rebuild)attention span have shown promise recently as adjuncts or alternatives to amphetamines in addressing symptoms common to Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Building cognitive control, to be better able to focus on just one thing, or single-task, might involve regular practice with a specialized video game that reinforces “top-down” cognitive modulation, as was the case in a popular paper in Nature last year. Cool but still notional. More insipid but also more clearly critical to addressing what’s being called the ADHD epidemic is plain old physical activity.\nThis morning the medical journalPediatrics published research that found kids who took part in a regular physical activity program showed important enhancement of cognitive performance and brain function. The findings, according to University of Illinois professor Charles Hillman and colleagues, “demonstrate a causal effect of a physical program on executive control, and provide support for physical activity for improving childhood cognition and brain health.” If it seems odd that this is something that still needs support, that’s because it is odd, yes. Physical activity is clearly a high, high-yield investment for all kids, but especially those attentive or hyperactive. This brand of research is still published and written about as though it were a novel finding, in part because exercise programs for kids remain underfunded and underprioritized in many school curricula, even though exercise is clearly integral to maximizing the utility of time spent in class.\nEarlier this month, another study found that a 12-week exercise program improved math and reading test scores in all kids, but especially in those with signs of ADHD. (Executive functioning is impaired in ADHD, and tied to performance in math and reading.) Lead researcher Alan Smith, chair of the department of kinesiology at Michigan State, went out on no limb at all in a press statement at the time, saying, “Early studies suggest that physical activity can have a positive effect on children who suffer from ADHD.”\nLast year a very similar study in the Journal of Attention Disorders found that just 26 minutes of daily physical activity for eight weeks significantly allayed ADHD symptoms in grade-school kids. The modest conclusion of the study was that “physical activity shows promise for addressing ADHD symptoms in young children.” The researchers went on to write that this finding should be “carefully explored with further studies.”\n“If physical activity is established as an effective intervention for ADHD,” they continued, “it will also be important to address possible complementary effects of physical activity and existing treatment strategies …” Which is a kind of phenomenal degree of reservation compared to the haste with which millions of kids have been introduced to amphetamines and other stimulants to address said ADHD. The number of prescriptions increased from 34.8 to 48.4 million between 2007 and 2011 alone. The pharmaceutical market around the disorder has grown to several billion dollars in recent years while school exercise initiatives have enjoyed no such spoils of entrepreneurialism. But, you know, once there is more research, it may potentially be advisable to consider possibly implementing more exercise opportunities for kids.\nOver all, the pandemic of physical inactivity, as Hillman and colleagues put it in their Pediatrics journal article today, is “a serious threat to global health” responsible for around 10 percent of premature deaths from noncommincable diseases. But it clearly manifests in ways more subtle than deaths, including scholastic performance, which we’re continuously learning. I talked last week with Paul Nystedt, an associate professor of economics and finance at Jönköping University in Sweden, who just published a multi-country study that found that obese teenagers go on to earn 18 percent less money as adults than their peers, even if they are no longer obese. He believes that’s most likely because of the adversity that obese kids experience from classmates and teachers, which leads to both cognitive and noncognitive disparities between obese and non-obese kids. Because obese children are more likely to come from low-income homes to begin with, that only perpetuates wealth gaps and stifles mobility. Nystedt and his coauthors conclude, “The rapid increase in childhood and adolescent obesity could have long-lasting effects on the economic growth and productivity of nations.”\nJohn Ratey, an associate professor of psychiatry at Harvard, suggests that people think of exercise as medication for ADHD. Even very light physical activity improves mood and cognitive performance by triggering the brain to release dopamine and serotonin, similar to the way that stimulant medications like Adderall do. In a 2012 TED talk, Ratey argued that physical exercise “is really for our brains.” He likened it to taking “a little bit of Prozac and a little bit of Ritalin.” As a rule, I say never trust anyone who has given a TED talk. But maybe in this case that’s a constructive way to think about moving one’s body. But not the inverse, where taking Ritalin counts as exercise.", "scores": {"score": 3, "score_transform_1": 5, "score_transform_2": 5, "score_transform_3": 0}}
{"id": "2254", "text": "Gliomas are common intracranial neoplasias in dogs. However, the underlying pathogenic mechanisms remain unclear. In humans, isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 (IDH2) is often mutated in gliomas. Although almost human IDH2 mutations have been identified at the Arg172 codon, few studies have reported structural, functional or mutational information for canine IDH2. In this study, we cloned the full-length canine IDH2 (cIDH2) cDNA and substituted wild type Arg174 (cIDH2 WT: corresponding to R172 of human IDH2) with Lys (cIDH2 R174K). The cIDH2 WT and R174K proteins were overexpressed in HeLa cells, and their presence was confirmed using an anti-human IDH2-WT mAb (clone: KrMab-3) and an anti-IDH2-R172K mAb (clone: KMab-1). The IDH2 activity between cIDH2 WT and cIDH2 R174K transfectants was compared by measuring the production of NADH and NADPH. NADPH production was lower for cIDH2 R174K than that for cIDH2 WT transfectants. Finally, we detected increased expression of hypoxia inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1α) in cIDH2 R174K transfectants. This indicates that mutations at R174 can potentially induce carcinogenesis in canine somatic cells.\nASJC Scopus subject areas\n- General Veterinary", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

This is great advice to businesses, racing to deploy video calls to provide COVID-safe meetings and/or benefit from general conveniences and gain productivity. If 55% of the communication is truly nonverbal as suggested by Prof. Albert Mehrabian from University of California in Los Angeles, putting the interest of the customer ahead means listening carefully to the nonverbal channels. In video calls, one must try hardest to read, understand and manage the customer interest expressed in the video images.In this study, our primary objective was to analyse and evaluate the practicality of a project to develop a machine-learning model that can predict and quantify a level of interest of a video caller from his facial images. As such, our secondary objective was to explore facial and behavioural expressions, highly correlated to or triggered by interests that are confirmed by imaged human subjects themselves, as well as explore areas and methods to capture them as to generate machine-learning training data.The result suggested the project to develop a machine-learning model would be practical. The finding included that a model based on static facial features visible in a video frame could be possible, but a model based on moving facial features estimated from sequence of consecutive video frames could do better, especially those with acute focus on eye movements.\nKeywords: video call communication conference zoom quantify interest digital transformation sales telecommute face facial image eye gaze blink emotion sentiment\nCite this paper:", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}

{"id": "2274", "text": "Lottery is a state-sanctioned form of gambling wherein players purchase tickets for a drawing to win a prize. The prize is often cash but can also be goods or services. While many people find the idea of winning a lottery appealing, it’s important to remember that there are risks associated with this game. You should always play within your budget and never spend more than you can afford to lose. You should also avoid superstitions and pick numbers randomly. In this way, you’ll increase your chances of winning by following the dictate of mathematics.\nState lotteries have a long history. The first recorded lotteries were held in the Low Countries in the 15th century as a means of raising funds to build town fortifications or to help the poor. A similar type of lottery was used in the Roman Empire, where prizes were usually in the form of luxury items for dinner parties.\nThe evolution of state lotteries has been remarkably uniform: the states legitimize a monopoly for themselves; establish a public corporation or agency to run the lottery (as opposed to licensing a private firm in return for a percentage of revenues); begin operations with a modest number of relatively simple games; and, due to pressure for additional revenue, progressively expand the scope of the games offered.\nThere are some fundamental problems with this model. One is that it obscures the regressivity of lottery proceeds, which benefit those at the top of the income ladder and, in turn, make it harder for the poor to afford basic public services. Another is that it puts lottery officials at cross-purposes with the general public, as they must promote gambling while trying to minimize negative consequences for the poor and problem gamblers.", "scores": {"score": 3, "score_transform_1": 5, "score_transform_2": 5, "score_transform_3": 0}}

{"id": "2313", "text": "People are wired for visual content. Our brains can absorb large volumes of data from an image much faster than by reading text.\nAccording to MIT scientists, it takes 13 microseconds to process an image, while reading text takes many more times than that. To test this statement, count the time it takes you to read one single word, and you will see it's longer than a tenth of a second.\nThe reason why you should invest in visually-appealing content goes beyond the speed at which an individual can process information.\nIn this article, we'll take a look at five reasons why visual content is a must in your content marketing strategy.\nOnline readers face a multitude of challenges when presented with an article. They can easily click away at any second to never go back to reading your content. According to a 2008 study of the Nielsen Norman group, online users read only 28% of the words. What's more, they skim content by default.\nVisual content increases readability, which measures the ease with which your readers can consume your content. The easier it is for a visitor to read a page or post, the better the readability.\nA meta-analysis of 155 studies on the effects of text illustration found that visual content improved comprehension and learning in 98% of the experiments. It seems that when you use visual content, you make it easier for people to skim your content, which, in turn, increases their capacity to read it.\nWritten and visual content aren't opposites; they complement each other. When you write an article, you want to add visual content, and when you create visual content (e.g., an infographic), you want to add written content.\nThe ease with which you can process visual content in your brain makes it much easier to distribute online. The popularity of memes lies almost entirely on their graphic nature; people don't have to explain a joke, they can only point to it, and others will understand it. Multiply this effect, and you get viral content.\nA survey done by Software Advice and Adobe found that images are considered the most important factor when creating social media content, with 80% of the respondents considering images \"Very Important\" or \"Important\" for their campaigns.\nSimilarly, Buzzsumo found articles featuring images every 75 to 100 words doubled the number of social shares than articles with fewer images.\nWhen writing content, make sure to sprinkle images and graphics every few hundred words. To do so, you can use graphic design software like PixTeller Editor, which makes the entire process easy for non-designers.\nThere's a rule among writers that says, \"show, don't tell.\" As Anton Chekhov famously explained, \"Don't tell me the moon is shining. Show me the glint of light on broken glass.\"\nWhen it comes to writing content, images, and graphics stir emotional responses in the viewers. Thus, they like, share, and comment on the content that embeds them, at least in social networks.\nBuzzsumo also found that Facebook posts featuring images saw 230% more engagement than those posts without images.\nTwitter has publicly stated tweets with images show similar results: \"We can confirm that adding video, links, and photos all result in an impressive boost in the number of Retweets.\"\nIn fact, they found visual content tends to generate a 35% boost in retweets.\nVisual content should become an essential part of your overall content marketing strategy. Instead of creating visual content exclusively for social media, create images and graphics that fit your blog and social media content. This will make your entire content development process much more efficient.\nThanks to its tendency to become viral, visual content increases the number of visitors a website can get. Among the numerous metrics you can use in your web analytics, pageviews are one of the most important.\nA pageview measures an instance of a page being loaded in a browser. In other words, it measures a single visit, disregarding previous visits or sessions. The more pageviews you can generate, the better it can be for your business, mainly if you use advertising as your primary monetization strategy.\nIn 2011, a study carried out by Skyword found that visual content gets 94% more views than non-visual content.\nOne way to generate more page views for your content is through Google's search engine results. For the past few years, Google has increased its algorithm's power to process visual information and use it to understand and rank a website.\nIn fact, Google has developed a specific ranking algorithm called VisualRank, which analyzes and compares content within images using computer vision and locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) techniques.\nVisual search hasn't become mainstream yet, but it soon will. With the advent of Google Lens search results and Google's continuous optimization of its ranking algorithm, it's better to be prepared than to wait for too long.\nIn the meantime, you can create images and optimize them, so they rank in Google's images search results. You can do so by using alt-tags and using names that explain what an image is about.\nBy creating visual content, you have higher chances of attracting more traffic, both from Google's current image search results and its fast-growing Google visual search results.\nVisual content helps you make your content more shareable and engaging, which generates page views. But if this wasn't enough, it can also help you generate B2B sales.\nA DemandGen report found that 86% of buyers wanted to interact with visual content on demand. We can assume that such a reaction may be due to the ease with which buyers can process and digest visual content, compared to technical content.\nIn 2020, Content Marketing Institute and Marketing Profs 2020 B2B Benchmarks Budgets and Trends reported found that 67% of B2B marketers use a mix of infographics, charts, photos, and data visualization in their marketing campaign.\nWhen building your B2B sales funnel, make sure to add questions that your sales and customer support teams find regularly, and create visual content like the one mentioned above.\nVisually appealing content should be a part of every content marketing team's efforts. It positively affects every aspect of the visitor's experience-from increasing your pageviews to making it easier for them to engage, share, and read it. It can even assist you with your sales efforts.\nNowadays, visual content has become a specific task, even for non-designers. Make sure to use a free graphic maker like PixTeller to help you create visually-appealing content for your marketing strategy.\nUntil next time, Be creative! - Pix'sTory made by Ivan Kreimer\nIvan Kreimer is a freelance content writer for hire who creates educational content for SaaS businesses like Leadfeeder and Campaign Monitor.

{"id": "2353", "text": "The aim of this study is to describe the postnatal change in dendritic morphology of those motoneurons in the hypoglossal nucleus that innervate the genioglossus muscle. Forty genioglossal (GG) motoneurons from four age groups (1-2, 5-6, 13-15, and 19-30 postnatal days) were labeled by intracellular injection of neurobiotin in an in vitro slice preparation of the rat brainstem and were reconstructed in three-dimensional space. The number of primary dendrites per GG motoneuron was approximately 6 and remained unchanged with age. The development of these motoneurons from birth to 13-15 days was characterized by a simplification of the dendritic tree involving a decrease in the number of terminal endings and dendritic branches. Motoneurons lost their 6th-8th order branches, in parallel with an elongation of their terminal dendritic branches maintaining the same combined dendritic length. The elongation of terminal branches was attributed to both longitudinal growth and the apparent lengthening caused by resorption of distal branches. The elimination of dendritic branches tended to increase the symmetry of the tree, as revealed by topological analysis. Later, between 13-15 days and 19-30 days, there was a reelaboration of the dendritic arborization returning to a configuration similar to that found in the newborn. The length of terminal branches was shorter at 19-30 days, while the length of preterminal branches did not change, suggesting that the proliferation of branches at 19-30 days takes place in the intermediate parts of terminal branches. The three-dimensional distribution of dendrites was analyzed by dividing space into six equal volumes (hexants). This analysis revealed that GG motoneurons have major components of their dendritic tree oriented in the lateral, medial, and dorsal hexants. Further two-dimensional polar analysis (consisting of eight sectors) revealed a reconfiguration of the tree from birth up to 5-6 days involving resorption of dendrites in the dorsal, dorsomedial, and medial sectors and growth in the lateral sector. Later in development (between 13-15 days and 19-30 days), there was growth in all sectors, but of a greater magnitude in the dorsomedial, medial, and dorsolateral sectors.", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

{"id": "2375", "text": "Photo Credit: Getty Images\nHow Jon Stewart single-handedly turned politics into a satirical spectacle\nEthan Chan, Senior Staff Writer\n“While celebrities can act as catalysts for positive political change, their political expressions can also alienate fans and further polarize the already divisive world of politics.” This sentence came straight from my previous opinion piece, where I discussed the dangers associated with the intersection of celebrities and politics. In general, the potential for misinformation among celebrities, coupled with their significant influence over the global population, raises concerns about their public involvement in political matters. Although the fusion of politics and celebrities can be precarious and potentially polarizing, one comedian has successfully bridged the gap between these two worlds, ultimately paving the way for more politically informed celebrities. His name is Jon Stewart.\nFor a span of 17 years, Jon Stewart’s The Daily Show served as a nexus where humour and satire converged with profound political insight, marking the first instance any late-night talk show host discussed politics. Stewart’s unique approach transcended mere entertainment; it demonstrated that humour can be a powerful tool for conveying complex political information. At the core of Stewart’s success was his ability to bridge the gap between comedy and serious political discussion, especially surrounding sensitive topics like 9/11. The Daily Show was more than just about delivering snarky punchlines. It allowed millions of people to engage critically with the world of politics.\nMerging politics and comedy is complex because it requires celebrities to remain objective and hold both right- and left-leaning parties accountable. Without batting an eye, Stewart courageously critiqued both political factions, predominantly in the aftermath of 9/11, where he shared his personal connection to the attack to foster a sense of community among the audience. In fact, Stewart’s Crossfire interview post-9/11 held politicians accountable for their actions and statements by outing them to the eyes and ears of millions of viewers.\nAlthough Stewart left The Daily Show in 2015, he has remained in the comedic spotlight. Stewart began an Apple TV+ show titled The Problem with Jon Stewart, where he continued challenging the current political landscape. However, his new show lacks the same impact as The Daily Show, with critics questioning whether his work building what they call a “political-celebrity landscape” was ultimately positive and balanced among the right- and left-leaning parties or too supportive of one political party. After hearing these critiques, Stewart acknowledged his platform as a medium, not a fact bank. Specifically, he recognized that his arguments are reflective of his own opinion and should spark active conservation rather than be interpreted as permanent political activism.\nOverall, Jon Stewart’s legacy is one of a trailblazer who used his celebrity platform as a comedian to engage audiences with the complex world of politics. The Daily Show successfully challenged the norms of late-night television by changing how audiences consume political information and leading to the rise of Fallon, Kimmel, and Colbert — all of whom now discuss politics in their monologues. Despite stepping down from the The Daily Show, Stewart’s influence on the socio-political landscape continues to serve as a model for how celebrities can articulate their political views without fear of repercussions. This is achieved by posing tough questions, confronting harsh truths, and holding those in positions of power accountable, as opposed to complaining from the sidelines.", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}

Main action here: finishing up getting instruments for the Bards College; investigating what happened to the family in Frostflow Lighthouse; claiming Goldenhills Plantation; and doing a hard push through the rest of the College of Winterhold plot, running Mzulft and Labyrinthian, and then returning to the college for the finale.\nPlay by play\n- Play dates: 9/10, 9/13/2023\n- Session numbers in this run: 15-16\nSunday the 10th\n- Started off in Lakeview\n- Boinged from there to Whiterun to sell stuff, then rode out with intent to head for Hob’s Fall Cave\n- Got surprise Blood Dragon on the road right by Pelagia Farm\n- Saw Alfhild Battle-Born draw a knife and yell YOU’RE MINE and a guard draw a bow, and then the dragon dropped right down out of the sky into the middle of the road\n- Team Dragonborn got in on the fight, and we all took out the dragon!\n- Didn’t see where Alfhild went though\n- Left some stuff in the chest at Tundra Homestead’s forge, need to remember to check that\n- Headed north from there, and fought and killed assorted critters\n- Got turned around a bit at the crossroads just west-ish of Heljarchen\n- Marked Shrouded Grove for the map, where I saw a couple of wolves, but did not head in there\n- Instead, got back on the road and headed for Wayward Pass; got through there and fought more wolves\n- Spotted large white wolf pack again, and this time they were fighting regular wolves!\n- Got a couple of white wolf pelts as a result, though we didn’t engage the main pack, and I saw that the white wolf pelts were more valuable than regular wolf pelts\n- Headed from there towards Hob’s Fall Cave\n- Took out a snow bear en route and also a cave bear\n- And a female sabre cat; spotted babies near her, too, sorry babies\n- Finally made it to Hob’s Fall Cave and headed in to run the place\n- Got the stash of spellbooks halfway through, and the Stone of Barenziah\n- Cleared the boss chamber, got the flute, and got out\n- Rode back towards Wayward Pass from there, intending to head to Stony Creek\n- Went past those white wolves again but did not engage\n- Spotted an ice mage vs. fire mage fight though\n- Got a little out of my way and wound up at Frostflow Lighthouse, so ran that again since it’s been a while since I last did that\n- Had to stay the hell out of the way of chaurus a bunch and I was down on healing potions\n- Actually ran out of arrows, that doesn’t happen often :O\n- So had to punt to throwing a bunch of flame atronach and also lightning\n- Only a few Falmer but we took them out\n- Got a trifle concerned when Lucien and Lydia vanished, but finally took out the last chaurus reaper and got the hell out, and noted with relief that Lydia and Lucien were both okay\n- Took the remains of Habd up to the lighthouse as per his final wishes, and got the Sailor’s Repose ability\n- Went back through Wayward Pass and found dead treasure hunter with a note pointing towards Bruca’s Leap Redoubt\n- Decided to see if I could go ahead and clear the Seducer bandit camp near Yorgrim Overlook\n- Answer: yes, but it took me two tries to do so\n- Got all the Seducer armor and the Demented Elytra\n- Got the note about the treasure in Crystaldrift Cave\n- Finally got back on the road again and headed to Stony Creek\n- Gathered 20 jazbay because I could and because it’s easier to do with Convenient Horses\n- Killed assorted critters\n- Hit the silver vein not far from Mzulft’s stairs\n- Finally reached Stony Creek\n- Set up a camp there and worked on improving Camping perks\n- Burned through a bunch of deadwood since I had 14 units of it and that stuff is heavy\n- Slept in the tent then got up the next morning to run the cave\n- Sent the Elytra Nymph off to wait for me at Myrwatch\n- Lucien started throwing lines about sensing something powerful and chaotic in the place\n- Made enough noise in the long twisty passage killing bandits that the one in the side room came out to attack us, and that wound up triggering the gas build up, ouch\n- But we took that guy out, and I cleared the side room to get the Stone of Barenziah as well as the lute\n- Headed back to the back chamber and took out the bandits back there\n- Got Ruin’s Edge and also mined the two moonstone veins in there\n- Came back out again, broke camp, and mounted up\n- Boinged to Solitude and sold a bunch of stuff\n- Checked in at the Bards College and got the instruments back to Pantea and Inge\n- Then came back out again and found Giraud at the Winking Skeever; gave him back the drum\n- Chatted a bit extra with him and told him what had happened at Dead Men’s Respite\n- Boinged back to Lakeview and got courier with letter from Tyra Blood-Fire\n- Let Lydia and Lucien stand down for a while\n- Built an enchanter table, and also started on the Storage Wing\n- Slept some and then got up in the morning to train Lucien and chat with him some more\n- Paused there until next time\n- Level ups note: forgot to note last few level ups, ended this session at level 33\nWednesday the 13th\n- Started at Lakeview, and got Lydia on duty along with Lucien\n- Rode out sorta the long way to get to Swindler’s Den and get that book for Rustleif\n- Passed Thalmor on the way but not in their vicinity long enough to piss them off\n- Swindler’s Den had respawned so took out all the bandits between us and the book, then got out again\n- Rode from there over towards Goldenhills to run the plot to get that\n- En route, passed a giant fighting with a couple of sabre cats\n- Stayed the hell out of the way of the giant, then looted the sabre cats and the nearby dead skeever\n- Ran the Goldenhills plot as per usual\n- The wolves didn’t come immediately at us by the well, just because Realistic Animals and Predators was in effect, but they did finally come at us once I mined the nearby iron vein\n- There was a sabre cat as well, so we took that out\n- Took custody of the farm\n- Planted some stuff, and confirmed that the objective to plant crops does in fact let you plant ingredients\n- From there, boinged to Dawnstar to drop off the book\n- Heard Seren raising the possibility of their moving to Hammerfell with Rustleif, because she’s worried about the war\n- Gave him the book and got the Smithing bump\n- Boinged to Myrwatch and dropped off Halldir’s Staff and a bunch of books\n- Boinged to Lakeview and dropped off ingredients and smithing supplies\n- Boinged to Hendraheim and left the Torchbug in a Jar there\n- Boinged to Whiterun to sell stuff\n- Doublechecked the Hall of the Dead: oh good, Alfhild Battle-Born wasn’t killed by that dragon (And I did in fact see Alfhild out in the city shortly thereafter)\n- From Whiterun, rode eastward to get to Mzulft\n- Got a dragon right by Honningbrew, and Farkas of the Companions was going by, so he actually got in on the fight! Way to go Farks!\n- Cranky fire-flinging Imperial at the spawn point near White River Watch\n- She was wearing mostly ebony armor so grabbed that for outfitting of future housecarls, most likely\n- Camped out for the night just shy of Valtheim Towers, near the Ritual Stone\n- In the morning, wolves attacked right by Valtheim Towers, and the toll bandit was all SOMEBODY HELP, so we killed the wolves\n- The bandit then tried to hit us up for the toll, and I took the Intimidate option, because Elessir was NOT amused by this woman having the gall to hit us up for 200 gold after we killed the wolves for her 😛\n- She accepted the “we pay you nothing and i don’t kill you” option; smart move, bandit plunderer\n- Considered heading up to Hillgrund’s Tomb to recruit Golldir for the farm, but decided against it, in the mood to get somebody else on duty there for this playthrough\n- Ran into random ice mage on the way into Eastmarch’s tundra; took him out and took his stuff\n- Took road route that led us through Darkwater Crossing\n- Saw some Stormcloaks wandering around but they didn’t get hostile at us\n- Tried talking to a couple of the NPCs but nobody had any interesting quest prompts\n- Marked the Atronach Stone for the map\n- Rode onward from there towards Mzulft\n- Cleared the storehouse and got the first of the aetherium shards, then ran Mzulft\n- Killed once partway through by Falmer, and then killed once again by the large group of Falmer in the room just before the centurion; otherwise got through okay\n- Skipped some of the side rooms with chaurus in them since i was running pretty heavy on the inventory\n- Got the focus stone off that last group of Falmer\n- Took down the centurion and cleared that room of its key and other treasure\n- Made it to the oculory and confronted Paratus\n- Had some trouble remembering how the hell to focus the damn mechanism, i always have to look that part up\n- Got him to spill the beans about where the Staff of Magnus is\n- Got the vision from Nerien on the way out\n- Pretty sure somewhere in Mzulft is where I leveled up to 34; took Magicka bump and Ebony Smithing perk\n- Fast traveled back to the college\n- Played through breaking through Ancano’s shielding, everything go boom, OHNOEZ THE ARCH-MAGE IS DEAD\n- Ran down to help Winterhold with the magic anomalies\n- Ran back up to report to Mirabelle; she gave me the torc and Savos’ amulet, and I headed out to prep for Labyrinthian\n- Got a couple more anomalies on the way out\n- Accidentally hit a guard with Dawnbreaker though and got a bounty; rolled back from that to coming out of the Hall of the Elements after talking to Mirabelle ;P\n- Boinged to Myrwatch first, thinking I’d set out from there, but realized I’d rather stash all my ingredients and building mats at Lakeview; did leave some books at Myrwatch though\n- Boinged to Lakeview\n- Retrieved a bunch of things off the horse and stashed most of the building mats\n- Smelted my ebony ore, and used that and the two ingots I had to improve my ebony sword and the two pieces of ebony mage gear I had\n- Dropped off ingredients in the ingredients barrel\n- Put enchantments on some gear to prep for heavy duty mage running\n- Put on the purple conjuration robe I’d picked up, the ebony mage boots and gloves, and the black cowl I got off the ice mage; also confirmed I can in fact enchant earrings\n- Slapped a frost enchantment on the ebony mage boots and magicka regen on the gloves, too, and magicka regen on the cowl\n- All this enchanting kicked me up to level 35; took Stamina bump and Summoner perk in Conjuration\n- Boinged to Whiterun to sell more stuff to help whittle down the carry load\n- Then rode from there towards Labyrinthian; cut a path about halfway between Silent Moons Camp and Bleakwind Basin\n- Dragon landed right on top of us near a grove of trees! Regular dragon, reasonably quick kill\n- The fight alerted the bandits over at Silent Moons Camp, since their dots activated on the HUD, but they didn’t come over to fight with us\n- Also wasn’t close enough to piss off the giants or the mammoths\n- Proceeded from there to find and clear Greenspring Hollow\n- Rode past Drelas’ Cottage next; hung out there for a few minutes to see if I could trigger anything that might make Drelas run out\n- Got a frost dragon! May or may not have been the Eldersblood Peak dragon? Took it out, no sign of Drelas though\n- Also took out a nearby sabre cat\n- Wandered around a bit until I got a good path to Labyrinthian\n- Fought a couple of frost trolls on the way in as you do\n- Parked Hildr and then headed in to run the place\n- Did not get Telekinesis spell off the table in the first room, dang! Got Paralysis Rune instead, which I already knew\n- Killed once by the skeletal dragon; second time through, threw my flame atronach in there a few times just to thin out the crowd of skeletons, and succeeded in taking out the dragon\n- Had a little trouble getting Lydia past the gate once I opened it, it kept closing before she could come through, until I got positioned well enough to get her to immediately follow me\n- Threw Unbounded Flames down onto a couple of draugr further down in the long spiraling path, just to see how that spell worked; answer: pretty damn well actually\n- Got the Equilibrium spell as per usual in the side room with the dead conjurer and the alchemy lab\n- The hallway with the spellcaster traps of doom was already disrupted for the most part, so I went through there on the first try\n- Got overloaded from grabbing things\n- Made it to the Slow Time Word Wall and got that Shout unlocked\n- Nabbed the three ebony ingots\n- Finally made it to Morokei, and Lydia and Lucien did a lot of the work here; I parked on some of the higher levels of the chamber and sniped at Morokei when I could get a bead on him\n- Finally took him out and got the Staff of Magnus and his mask\n- Nabbed boss chest loot and extra chest loot on the way out\n- Actually killed once by Estormo! He got me with lightning\n- Second time through I let Lydia, Lucien, and flame atronach take him out for me, then got the hell out of Labyrinthian\n- Frost troll outside so sniped it from the ledge, then threw Become Ethereal so I could jump down\n- Whistled to get Hildr over, and put a lot of stuff on the horse to get unburdened\n- Fast traveled to Winterhold\n- Showed up on the bridge and Tolfdir unfortunately blocked the way with a frost atronach, dang^2\n- Tried to get around it and fell off the damn bridge, ouch\n- Thrown back to getting on Hildr back at Labyrinthian\n- Take two! This time made it up to Tolfdir and initiated the charge to get back into the college\n- Killed a couple times by Ancano and/or magic anomalies, because I ran out of healing potions and soul gems to recharge the staff\n- Worked out the correct timing to start actually attacking the Eye, and finally took out Ancano\n- Cue the Psijics showing up to take the Eye, and Lucien boggling that they actually made me Arch-Mage XD\n- Took custody of the Arch-Mage’s quarters and robes\n- Saved there until next time\nFrostflow Lighthouse is not a dungeon I run all that often in my Skyrim runs, but since I stumbled across it kind of by accident this time, I decided to go ahead and give it another shot. And it was a stiff dungeon to run! Lucien and Lydia both had trouble following me in, which meant that at the end of it, it was just me and my flame atronach against the chaurus. And I ran out of healing potions and arrows.\nI don’t think I’ve ever run out of arrows before! Clearly I need to stock Elessir up on more arrows!\nMeanwhile, I continue to love that Lucien comments on everything. He was fascinated by our finding an elytra of a different color, and also by the note about the treasure in Crystaldrift Cave. Boy’s got a nice healthy mix of scholarly interest and interest in treasure. ;D\nHe had commentary about Ruin’s Edge, too, which I am not sure I remember him doing when I had him following Harrow? I noticed him commenting on how he sensed a source of power as we were heading into Stony Creek Cave–which certainly speaks to his general magical abilities! And he suspected it was chaotic and dangerous, and therefore probably something we shouldn’t allow to be in the wrong hands.\nLater on, back at Lakeview, he had interesting things to say about the bow as well. All in all I continue to appreciate the work Lucien’s creator put into him. <3\nSpeaking of NPC commentary, I was surprised and pleased when I took a few extra moments to chat with Giraud after giving him Rjorn’s Drum. I wound up telling him what happened in Dead Men’s Respite, and he was blown away by this. He even told me I should absolutely write that down for the Poetic Edda! Ha! Excellent bard reaction there.\nNot to be outdone by other chatty NPCs, Lydia, who has a bunch more lines in this load order than she does in unmodded Skyrim, threw me this line at Lakeview:\nIf you’re leaving town, I wouldn’t mind coming with for a while.\nLOLOLOL. Somebody is bored with being a steward, clearly. Even though she actively volunteered for it.\nWell, since you asked so nicely… ;D\nI was also surprised and pleased to discover that once you get Goldenhills Plantation and unlock the objective to plant crops, that doesn’t mean the crops specifically have to be food. You can also plant alchemical ingredients. I like that, it means that if you wanted, you could plant the whole damn farm to be an alchemy supply farm. That might actually be beneficial for Rorikstead’s economy if all the other nearby farms are planting food crops!\nPrepping to gear up in mage gear for Labyrinthian let me confirm that I could in fact enchant earrings. Mind you, I’m not sure I like the look of them on Elessir. But I went with them for the magicka regen enchantment anyway, and the cowl hid them regardless.\nI do kind of wish you could make other styles of earrings, though! I think a smaller gold earring style on him would look good. (And a quick check of Nexus suggests that there are other mods I could look into about this. For future playthroughs, though, not this one.)\nLucien got in yet more amusing commentary while I was doing my enchanting run at Lakeview. He chirped out something about “You’re enchanting!” And then backpedaled hard as he tried to explain that he hadn’t meant it like that, LOLOL. I think Elessir looked up archly from the enchanter table, threw him a devilish grin, and drawled, “You sure you aren’t trying to flirt with me?”\nRunning Labyrinthian this time, I tried out the Unbounded Flames spell, since I had open space enough to cast that without impacting Lucien or Lydia. That worked spectacularly well. Fried a draugr with that. I just need to be really certain I can cast it without any friendly NPCs in the way.\nI was vaguely stunned that the Hallway of Spellcaster Trap Doom, where I have been fried on many a prior Labyrinthian run, was already disrupted. The three soul gems in the back were already out of place, so the traps weren’t firing, and I easily dislodged the other two. I think maybe the traps got disrupted by a draugr throwing a Shout? Because I did hear that just before I reached that spot.\nAnd, LOL, I forgot I wasn’t running Cloaks of Skyrim in this run. So I was briefly surprised Morokei didn’t drop a cloak. I think what this tells me is, I do need Cloaks back in my rotation!\nWhen I made it back to the College for the final fight with Ancano, I had to do it a few times before I finally worked out the timing of when to actually hit the Eye with the Staff. I have got to remember to hold on throwing the staff attack until Tolfdir actually yells for me to do so. This’ll help me save charge on the Staff, and ideally make it less likely that Ancano will have time to call more anomalies. And hopefully, that anybody else with me will help me kill him.\nAnd Lucien being absolutely flabbergasted that the player gets made Arch-Mage still makes me LOL.\nFavorite Lucien lines\nWhen we cleared the Seducer bandit camp:\nOoh, a journal. Love a good journal, they’re always full of clues. Step one of being a bandit leader – write down your evil plan. Never fails.\nAnd speaking of bandits, I daresay Lucien’s been training up his skill in the fine art of sarcasm:\nSvarig, indeed? Sounds like someone we need to chat to. I’m sure they’ll be entirely reasonable and non-violent with us.\nWarning about sensing a powerful thing inside Stony Creek Cave:\nWhatever it is I can sense in this cave, we can’t let these bandits keep it. There’s no knowing what they might use it for!\nWhile we’re shopping in Solitude:\nOh, I’ve heard about this place – the famous Solitude Fletcher that sells all those fancy crossbows. My mother would have a ball in here.\nObservations on Ruin’s Edge, once we’re safely back at Lakeview (and note spelling of recognise, clearly UK English spellings are in effect here, not surprising given that Lucien’s creator is British). This also raises interesting questions about how, exactly, Lucien found out that the Champion of Cyrodiil got this bow:\nDo you know, if I’m not mistaken, I actually think I might recognise that bow. It’s hard to say for absolute certain, but I’m fairly confident that what you have there is Ruin’s Edge. It’s from the Shivering Isles. Used to belong to Syl, Duchess of Dementia, until she gave it to the Champion of Cyrodiil as a reward for some favor or other. It’s supposed to have quite the enchantment. It can paralyze you, silence you, demoralize you or even drive you mad. Should come in handy, but… do be careful where you point it, won’t you?\nWhile teaching him how to cast Strangulation:\nYou do teach me friendly-sounding spells, don’t you?\nWhen we were going through Mzulft:\nI wonder how different the world would be if the Dwemer were still around.\nAnd it’s worth noting here that Lydia also threw a line on this very same idea (note small d on dwemer here, that’s how it showed up in the subtitle):\nI often wonder where we’d be if the dwemer were still around.\nI am now headcanoning that they actually said these lines pretty much at the same time! And Lucien and Elessir both blinked and looked twice at Lyds, who replied, “What? Just because I’m a housecarl and good at fighting doesn’t mean I don’t think about things.”\nMore from Lucien on Dwemer ruins, and his ancestor Octavius:\nOctavius wrote a lot about his experiences with Dwemer ruins. They almost killed him. Many, many times.\nLucien on Ancano, and he does have a point:\nI knew we couldn’t trust that Ancano. I mean, could anything about him shout “Clearly Evil” any louder?\nAfter we take out the magic anomalies in Winterhold:\nTeam Lucien one, Team Magical Glowy Wyrm Things, zero.\nLucien really does need to work on his phrasing when he’s not trying to flirt:\nGosh, you’re enchanting. No, I mean… that’s literally what you’re doing. Not that you’re not enchanting, but I meant to say… that is… ahem. Never mind.\nI noted this line in Harrow’s run when I ran Labyrinthian, but noting this again here because LOL, Lucien does have some level of genre savviness:\nKeep an eye out for the Staff. It’ll either be on a plinth, or wielded by an ancient undead sorcerer-lord. Fingers crossed for the plinth.\nLucien has OPINIONS on Labyrinthian:\nThis place is great! Undead dragons, ghostly wizards and a big scary Magicka-draining voice. What could be more fun?\nContinuing to demonstrate his genre savviness, the deeper we get into Labyrinthian:\nI have a horrible feeling we’re leaning distinctly away from the plinth option here.\nAnd he also has opinions on the Thalmor, after we take out Estormo:\nGods, the Thalmor just don’t give up, do they? Now I’m even more desperate to give Ancano a piece of my mind.\nI think this resulted in the following exchange:\nLydia: “Me, I want to give him a piece of my sword. And by give, I mean, stab him with it.”\nElessir: “I hate to break it to you, Lucien, but she’s right. Stopping Ancano’s going to require a bit more than harsh language.”\nLucien, ruefully: “Well, I try to be non-violent if I have the option. We, uh, aren’t going to have the option here, then?”\nLydia and Elessir both shake their heads.\nLucien: “All right then. Maybe I should break out that delightfully friendly-sounding Strangulation spell?”\nAnd last but not least, Lucien’s delightful rant about why the hell the player gets made Arch-Mage at the end of this plot:\nBut… but… I mean, with the greatest of respect… that’s insane! How long have we been members of the College? What qualifications do you have? Divines, how many lessons have we actually attended? Because that is a very small number, I can assure you. And now they want you to run the whole place? We’re hardly ever even here! We have so many other commitments it’s actually ridiculous. Thank the Divines I studied in Cyrodiil because this place? This place is totally off its rocker.\nNow that the College of Winterhold’s main plot is done, this frees Elessir up for his next major faction plot, which will probably be Thieves Guild.\nBut before I do that, kinda feeling like doing the extra post-Arch-Mage College of Winterhold stuff. Now that I know how to adjust the brightness on the Steam Deck properly, maybe I can get down into the Winterhold ruins and actually be able to see what the hell I’m doing down there.\nAlso kind of feeling like running the plot for Azura’s Star.

This year’s report emphasizes three main themes. First, marketing measurement and optimization solution customers should look for providers that strategically plan data restrictions and regulation. This is particularly relevant with the rise of data security concerns. Second, vendors should be measuring and optimizing short- and long-term marketing impact. Third, customers should look to vendors that balance technology and consulting engagement models. Because of the market’s limited knowledge and experience with analytics, customers need to pick platforms that can translate findings and provide recommendations based on model results.\nIn their 27-criteria evaluation of marketing measurement and optimization providers, Forrester researchers Jim Nail, Tina Moffett, and Joe Stanhope identified the 9 providers whom they consider most significant in the category: Analytic Partners, Ekimetrics, Gain Theory, Ipsos MMA, IRI, Marketing Evolution, Merkle, Neustar, and Nielsen.\nThe Wave Report details their findings and examines how each vendor meets (or falls short of) Forrester’s evaluation criteria and where vendors stand in relation to each other.\nIn order to help buyers select the right tools, the Wave Report outlines the current state of the market for top technologies and businesses, and separates the top providers into leaders, strong performers, contenders, and challengers. At Solutions Review, we’ve read the report, available here, and pulled a few of the most important takeaways.\nAnalytic Partners, Ipsos MMA, and Neustar Dominate as Leaders\nAnalytic Partners (AP) offers insights tools like GPS Enterprise, an end-to-end platform that incorporates data ingestion through its ADAPTA tool. ROI Genome, AP’s proprietary intelligence database, informs all components of its platforms. AP also offers high-touch support services that include marketing strategists, data engineers, account managers, and statisticians. Customers were very satisfied with AP’s unified measurement approach, and commend AP for its services, strategic vision, and roadmap. If your organization is looking to innovate its measurement strategy, consider exploring Analytic Partners.\nIpsos MMA has invested heavily in building out a competitive unified measurement offering with the aim of helping clients optimize business performance. Its offering consists of proprietary technology that provides a framework for clients to understand marketing performance, perform customer attribution, and execute market testing. Clients praise Ipsos MMA for its engagement model in deploying and delivering solutions, and they appreciate its ability to support global, multicountry measurement programs. Ipsos MMA should be used by companies that require global coverage and granular control of modeling systems.\nNeustar’s measurement solution leverages its partnerships, access to data, and proprietary measurement tool with the ability to optimize multiple scenarios. Neustar’s strategy focuses on building a solution that connects brands with customers in the moment. Customers gave Neustar high marks for its data expertise, particularly with regards to its data management process, data and identity platform, and data resource experts. Additionally, Neustar’s partnerships with Facebook and other closed ecosystems allow it frequent access to extremely rich customer-level data. Neustar is a good choice for organizations that want deep customer-level marketing performance measurement, as well as powerful analytics tools.\nGain Theory, Marketing Evolution, Ekimetrics, and IRI Stand Out as Strong Performers\nGain Theory uses both customer-level marketing performance and aggregate-level models to measure short-term marketing revenue gains. Gain Theory particularly stands out through its work on measuring marketing’s impact on short- and long-term business objectives, as well as helping clients develop strategies to optimize multiple objectives at the same time. Customers have praised Gain Theory for its unified measurement approach, as well as the sophistication of its model and native testing capabilities. Organizations looking to combine complex insights with driven marketing performance should experiment with Gain Theory.\nMarketing Evolution offers a highly differentiated approach that operates from the user-level up. It offers a sample-based approach that adapts to growing data gaps from walled gardens and cookie blocking. Marketing Evolution has received over $26 million in funding since the last Forrester Wave, and has continued to develop its offerings by building out an automated data ingestion, normalization, and validation platform, as well as rebuild its Marketing Control Dashboard. This solution is a good choice for organizations with robust first-party data and a willingness for a more hands-on approach.\nEkimetrics is new to this Forrester Wave and emphasizes the versatility of its staff; professionals with data science expertise as well as primary client contacts that help to develop a helpful and seamless vendor-client relationship. Its unified approach, known as One Vision. utilizes nested models to provide omnichannel analysis and enable deep dives into various marketing dimensions including media, brand, segments, and customer lifetime value. It continues to expand its offering by building consumer-facing decisioning and recommendation engines that leverage marketing analytics. Ekimetrics is a good solution for companies that need sophisticated data science offering.\nIRI couples its Unified Mesurement Model (UMM) with its RI Liquid Data platform. By utilizing a service-driven engagement approach, IRI can combine its expertise in marketing and analytics. It offers expertise in retail and consumer package goods (CPG) industries, which allows it to provide deeper insights into vital industries. By combining this knowledge with enhanced machine learning-based recommendation engines and augmented decision making, IRI offers a high quality service. Organizations that have diverse marketing investments with external factors that influence marketing performance should consider exploring IRI.\nMerkle Holds Its Own as a Contender\nMerkle is new to this Forrester Wave, but brings a long history as a customer database and engagement agency and digital experience agency. This gives it valuable expertise in data ingestion and processing, as well as a more person-centric view of marketing. Merkle plans to enhance its data assets with AI-driven technology and image recognition, which is supported by its recent acquisition of AI firm Ugam. Merkle is a good choice for organizations with complex data problems, as well as those looking for a more consulting-based approach to analyzing marketing performance.", "scores": {"score": 0, "score_transform_1": 0, "score_transform_2": 0, "score_transform_3": 1}}
{"id": "2509", "text": "Originally published by DodgerBlue.com\nIn an offseason where the Los Angeles Dodgers lost Trea Turner, Justin Turner and Cody Bellinger in free agency, they signed J.D. Martinez to help boost their offense.\nScott Boras, the agent who represents Martinez, said the veteran slugger took roughly $6 million to $7 million less than he could have made elsewhere by signing the one-year, $10 million deal with the Dodgers. Entering his age-35 season, Martinez placed an emphasis on winning a World Series, which is the main reason he decided to sign with the Dodgers\n“I didn’t want to be on a team that was going to be rebuilding, or be on a team that was going to see where we were going, we don’t know how we’re going to be or we think we’re going to be good,” Martinez said at Mookie Betts’ charity bowling tournament.\n“I want to be on a team that’s going to be in the running for it and that’s going to be right there come October. That was my main thing. That was literally my main focus. When I talked to Andrew on the phone, I said, ‘I’m doing this because I believe in you guys and I believe in you and the team you put on the field every year.’”\nWhile Dodgers president of baseball operations Andrew Friedman and Betts were instrumental in Martinez untimely joining the club as well, his relationship with Dodgers hitting coach Robert Van Scoyoc helped the five-time All-Star make his decision.\n“Rob’s been my best friend since 2013 or ’14,” Martinez said. “So him and Mookie were definitely in the high recruiting phase of me. It’s cool. I’m always tight with them, and fortunately enough for me, I’m in a part of my career where I just want to win.\n“That was one of my main decisions coming out here. They put a great team on the field every year, and I want to win. I’m getting to the backend of my career, and I know this is a really good chance and I know I can have fun my last two or three years in baseball and try to win another World Series.”\nMartinez won his first and only World Series in 2018 as a member of the Boston Red Sox against the Dodgers.\nThe three-time Silver Slugger projects to be the Dodgers’ primary designated hitter this season while batting in the middle of the lineup. Martinez is coming off a season where he hit .274/.341/.448 with 43 doubles, 16 home runs and 62 RBI in 139 games.\nThe Dodgers previously tried to trade for him multiple times in the past, which was something that Martinez considered could happen.\n“It was always in the back of my head that I could end up here,” he said. “I’m happy and this is where I wanted to be.”\nJ.D. Martinez expected to take on leadership role for Dodgers\nWhen Martinez was in Boston, he was credited for helping Betts and their other young hitters improve their offensive ability. Now that he is in L.A., he is already working out with Miguel Vargas.\n“That was one of the main things Andrew talked to me about,” Martinez said about mentoring younger hitters and taking on a leadership role. “That’s something that’s always come naturally to me on every team that I’ve been on.\n“I’ve helped a lot of younger guys and a lot of guys kind of gravitate to me, especially on the offensive side of things. That part is something I don’t even think about. I just be me and it kind of happens.”\nMake sure to follow Dodger Blue on Instagram!

{"id": "2523", "text": "Since the Internet has such an extensive reach, many businesses recognize it as a great opportunity for their marketing efforts. Any business that has a product or service to sell can launch a website and expand its market. However, simply launching a website is not enough to conquer new markets. There’s more to be done here and a website needs to be supported with internet marketing efforts.\nToday, there are many companies that offer internet marketing solutions for their clients. Any business that wants to increase its online presence can find a company that provides link building services. The main goal these services offer is higher rankings in various search engines, such as Google, Yahoo and Bing. Higher rankings are achieved with proper SEO (Search Engine Optimization) and link building.\nLink building services can drive more traffic to the website, therefore bringing in more visitors who can be converted into clients and customers. And considering that link building services will drive targeted traffic to the clients website, we can say that link building is a very powerful strategy that any business should use.\nWhat Link Building Services Actually Do?\nBuilding links to clients website is what will position that website as the top result of search engines, this being the main focus of every link building service. After analyzing the clients website, a plan is made and link building can begin. Links can be created in the form of press releases, low level links (profiles, quality directories, etc) article submissions and guest posts on various websites that are niche related to the clients website. Social media plays a big role in today’s SEO, so a serious link building service will create various social signals for a clients website. Specific keywords are chosen and used in link building process, and links are created for various pages of clients website.\nThe keywords used in link building process are specific for every website. Every business wants to sell a product or a service, so it’s natural that they want to be on top, when it comes to search engine, for the name of the product or service they are selling. Link building services will focus on these keywords and build links to selected web pages in order to raise their search engine ranking position. These are often called landing pages and a business can use these to convert visitors into customers.\nChoosing A LinkBuilding Service\nMany businesses are looking to work with a link building service to increase their online exposure. These can be the brick and mortar businesses, home based businesses or any other type of business actually. There is one question that many individuals who want to work with link building services ask : How to choose a reliable service? Some would say that the results is all that matters. However, increased traffic to a website should not be the only measure of the quality and reliability of a service. There are many ways to get website traffic and some of them have a short lifespan.\nThere are several things that are important when it comes to reliable, quality link building. You can find out a lot about a certain link building service by taking a closer look at the way they actually build links for clients websites.\nThings That Need To Be Avoided\nThe first thing any serious business should stay away from is automatically created links. These links are made with the use of software – there are many programs who can scrape content from other websites and post it to create links. This is a tactic that can yield results, this much is true, but they will soon be gone and the clients website will be penalized, never to have any traffic from a search engine again. Automatically created links can be made in the form of articles, blog posts, comments and forum posts.\nIt is also a good idea to avoid link building services which use link networks in order to position their clients site high in search engine results. Link networks are made up of many websites which post articles for one purpose only – to create a link. These websites are of poor quality, do not have any real value and are in constant danger of being penalized by the search engines. A website can achieve good rankings by using these link networks, but once the link network is devalued and loses its power, the clients website rankings will be lost. Again, it’s a short term strategy that should be avoided.\nIn addition to these two link building strategies, there is one other practice that any serious link building service will not offer – using the same content over and over again. You don’t want to work with a company that uses one article to create 5, 15 or 50 links to your website. These articles are considered duplicate content, which is frowned upon by search engines. They won’t have much value, if any at all, and the same goes with the links that are within these articles.\nWhat Do Reliable Link Building Services Offer?\nLink building service that posts unique, engaging content for every link it creates is the service you want to work with. They will find quality websites to post your posts and articles on, whether these are guest posts or simple article submissions. Any comments that are posted to other websites in order to build links are created manually and forum posts will be created with sense and care. A reliable and quality link building service has its own portfolio, serving their clients with high quality links. These are the types of links any serious business should desire for its website. High quality, long term links that will stay there to promote the website and push it to the top of search engine rankings.\nImages with courtesy of www.radicalmarketingsolutions.com, www.toprankblog.com, www.televox.com and www.web-tonic.co.uk.", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}

Bringing together students and teachers from six schools from within the catchment area of the future Strule Shared Education Campus, the event showcased the range of work and outcomes from this year’s project entitled ‘Sharing Spaces, Sharing Stories’.\nRunning over a series of months, this shared education project was underpinned by the Strule ethos of ‘Broadening Horizons’ and involved Primary 6 classes from each of the schools working collaboratively to support a culture of sharing, whilst maintaining and celebrating a strong sense of individuality and independence.\nAmmA Creative Learning (Education Authority) has developed and evolved this successful initiative over several years based on their extensive experience of working with children and young people, enhancing the school curriculum and making creative ideas a reality. The schools participated in an exciting programme of storytelling, creative writing, outdoor learning and digital illustration and animation.\n‘The Magic Harp’, a children’s book written by Northern Irish author, Declan Carville, provided the main focal point for the project, encouraging pupils to explore and share their thoughts and feelings, and understand the perspectives of others. Declan worked across all six schools and visited each of them to engage in a collaborative story writing experience, developing a new spin-off story to ‘The Magic Harp’ called ‘A Trip to Somewhere Exciting: Fergal’s Second Wish’.\nIn addition to working with Declan, the schools visited Gortin Glen Forest Park where they worked with Northern Ireland based artist, Mary Murphy and Emma McCaugherty from AmmA engaging in a series of outdoor learning activities designed to immerse the children in the natural world, bring ‘The Magic Harp’ story to life and enthuse the creative writing experience with Declan. This year’s programme was also developed with the Covid-19 pandemic in mind, and utilising outdoor spaces and virtual learning ensured that the children and teachers could work collectively and safely.\nFinally, children from each class had the opportunity to work directly with artist, Mel Carroll, who illustrated ‘The Magic Harp’. Mel took the children on an interactive journey through the creative process bringing the words on a page to life through character design and illustration. Each child then invented their own character illustration, which they then made real by using animation techniques.\nThe showcase event was a unique opportunity for the children and teachers to come together in one space to share their stories and see their work on the big screen. They viewed a professionally produced video that followed the entire process and heard Declan read their new story for the first time. To top it all off, they watched a surprise animation, produced specially by Mel Carroll and Jamie Baird.\nSpeaking at the event, AmmA Project Lead, Daniel O’Reilly said: ‘AmmA Creative Learning would like to thank all the principals, teachers, students and practitioners who engaged with us on this ‘magical’ project and we look forward to facilitating it again in the future, on behalf of and in conjunction with the Strule Shared Education Campus’.\nThe schools involved were Omagh County P.S., Holy Family P.S., Arvalee School, Gibson P.S., Omagh Integrated P.S. and Christ the King P.S.", "scores": {"score": 3, "score_transform_1": 5, "score_transform_2": 5, "score_transform_3": 0}}

Surrogacy agencies can help coordinate these efforts to ensure that you have everything you need throughout the surrogacy process.\nWhether you’re worried about the cost or the necessity of the services, you might be on the fence about using a surrogacy agency to complete your family. However, most intended parents find that, given the complexities of the process, having an experienced professional in their corner is invaluable.\nBelow, we’ve answered some common questions — which may help you decide whether or not going through a surrogacy agency is right for you:\nYou may have also heard them referred to as surrogacy groups, centers, programs or companies. Whatever you call them, they’re the same type of professional. They coordinate all the services that intended parents and surrogates need to complete the process, so they’re valued as a “one-stop shop” and one of the safest and least stressful ways to navigate a complex journey.\nWhile every agency will offer different services, most will offer:\nBe sure to reach out to agencies you’re interested in directly and go over the services they offer intended parents in detail. A good agency will cover your needs and then some, so if a candidate doesn’t offer these basic services, don’t hesitate to find a different agency.\nMatching intended parents and surrogates isn’t the only service that agencies provide. The most important thing they do is guide the partners through the process.\nSo regardless of whether or not you’ve already found your surrogacy partner, you may still benefit from the protection of working with an agency.\nThat being said, you don’t have to work with an agency. Intended parents who are already partnered with their future surrogate and jointly decide to D.I.Y. the process can complete what’s called an “independent surrogacy.” For this, you’ll still need to work with attorneys and a fertility clinic, at a minimum.\nThis is only recommended if you’re confident handling the surrogacy process on your own, because without an agency, you will be responsible for:\nRegardless of whether or not you work with an agency, you need to have a legal contract through an attorney, no matter how much you may love and trust the person you’re partnering with.\nNo, although an agency is the safest way to find a match.

Is she physically healthy enough for IVF and surrogacy? Is she mentally and emotionally prepared for this process? Is her family supportive of her decision?\nWhen you find a surrogate through an agency, they’re extensively screened to ensure a safe, secure process.\nAlthough the surrogate requirements for every agency will vary somewhat, they’re generally high standards, as the health and safety of everyone involved is the first priority. This way, when you search for a surrogate through an agency, you know that the women you connect with are safe and prepared for the journey ahead.\nAgencies will also help you navigate that match relationship, which can be beneficial in getting to know one another, establishing trust and building a strong connection.\nWhen choosing an agency, you should consider what you want out of your surrogacy journey. For example, what kind of surrogate are you looking for? What types of services are most important to you? Different agencies will have their own specialties and ideologies, just like any professional. This is an important decision, so choose the agency that best aligns with your individual goals.\nThe best way to start is by calling reputable agencies and asking questions. We recommend:\nRemember that choosing the cheapest agency, or trying to avoid using professionals to save money, is never wise. Surrogacy can be costly, to be sure.

{"id": "2590", "text": "While settling a dispute with Chevron, Burford Capital says it would never have financed Patton Boggs’ case against the oil giant if it weren’t for materially “false and misleading” statements by a Patton partner with whom it had a “special relationship.”\nIn the latest in a series of bombshell filings, Chevron today submitted a 26-page sworn declaration from the CEO of Burford Capital, a $300 million, publicly traded fund that in late 2010 agreed to finance Patton Boggs’s representation of the plaintiffs bringing an environmental suit against Chevron in Lago Agrio, Ecuador.\nIn it Burford CEO Christopher Bogart says his firm would never have invested in the case were it not for “false and misleading representations” made not only by Steve Donziger, the Lago Agrio team’s longtime New York lawyer, but also by Patton Boggs, a prominent Washington-based, AmLaw 100 law firm that agreed to take on the plaintiffs’ troubled environmental suit in February 2010 on a partial contingency basis. (Read the full declaration here.)\nBurford relied, Bogart says, on a misleading analysis of the case made by Patton Boggs partner James Tyrrell, Jr., with whom, Bogart says, Burford had a “‘special’ and multifaceted relationship” at the time. Most of the misrepresentations Bogart alleges concern the extent to which Patton Boggs already knew that a crucial damages assessment drafted by a purportedly “neutral and independent” court-appointed expert in the case had, in reality, been secretly ghost-written by the Lago Agrio plaintiffs lawyers themselves.\nEmails seeking comment from Tyrrell and other Patton Boggs attorneys were not immediately returned. Nor were emails to Donziger’s counsel, John Keker (who is in a court proceeding this morning) or the Lago Agrio plaintiff team’s spokesperson, Bill Hamilton of Fenton Communications.\nBecause an Ecuadorian provincial court issued an $18.2 billion judgment against Chevron in February 2011—later bumped up to $19 billion—Patton Boggs theoretically stands to collect hundreds of millions of dollars if the judgment can ever be enforced. The plaintiffs team is currently attempting to enforce it foreign courts, including those of Canada and Argentina.\nChevron is currently considering whether to bring fraud charges against Patton Boggs, the company stated in a Manhattan federal court filing Friday, and will make up its mind by May 10.\nOn October 31, 2010, Burford gave the plaintiffs $4 million in financing as the first tranche in what was planned to become a $15 million investment in the case. In exchange it received a 1.5% stake of any recovery, which was to rise to a 5.5% stake upon full funding.\nBut on February 1, 2011, Chevron (CVX) filed a civil RICO (Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act) suit in Manhattan federal court against Donziger, the Amazon Defense Fund, and others key figures involved in the Lago Agrio case, alleging wire fraud, extortion, money laundering, and obstruction of justice. U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan issued a preliminary injunction in March in a 131-page, 434-footnote ruling that detailed the disturbing state of the evidence against Donziger and his Ecuadorian collegues on the case at the time. (The injunction was later vacated on appeal jurisdictional grounds unrelated to Kaplan’s factual findings.)\nBurford never made any follow-up investments.\nAlthough Burford quickly resold most of its stake in the case in December 2010, it retained until today an upside interest in the outcome of the lawsuit. With today’s settlement, however, Burford turns that remaining stake over to Chevron. In this morning’s joint press release, Bogart says, “Burford stands by its clients in the face of aggressive litigation tactics by their opponents, but Burford does not sit still for being deceived or defrauded and has no interest in profiting from such conduct.”\nChevron’s general counsel, Hewitt Pate, in turn praised Burford in the joint statement for having “acted responsibly after becoming aware of the fraud, bribery, and extortion perpetrated here.”\nIn Bogart’s affidavit he argues that Burford was especially inclined to credit Tyrrell’s assessments of the case because of Tyrrell’s “special relationship” with the firm. To begin with, he writes, Tyrrell was, as a former partner at Latham & Watkins, close friends of four former Latham partners who then occupied senior positions at Burford.\n“Tyrrell was also an advocate and enthusiast of litigation funding,” Bogart continues, extending “support to start-up funders.” For instance, Patton Boggs was providing Burford with rent-free office space at its New York office, which Tyrrell heads, at the time the Lago Agrio investment was negotiated, Bogart writes.\nLast month Judge Kaplan ordered Patton Boggs to make voluminous productions of documents, finding that any attorney client privilege that might apply would be pierced due to the “crime fraud exception,” which applies when there is evidence that documents were made in furtherance of a crime or fraud. Though Judge Kaplan made no finding as to whether Patton Boggs itself had any actual knowledge of any crime or fraud, his 73-page ruling was tart in its rejection of the firm’s portrayal of itself as an unrelated outsider who, if it complied with the subpoena, would be forced to incur excessive and burdensome costs.\nHe wrote: “Here, [Patton Boggs] was well aware of Chevron’s fraud allegations when it joined the [Lago Agrio plaintiffs] team – indeed it was brought on to combat them – and understood Chevron’s intention to fight this matter vigorously. Any failure to have anticipated that its involvement could lead to discovery obligations and expenditures on its own behalf, if there was such a failure, would have reflected an uncommon lack of foresight.”\nBurford’s investment in the controversial case—which, like most such investments, remained secret until disclosed through ancillary U.S. litigation brought by Chevron—was the subject of a May 2011 Fortune feature story which had been highly critical of the investment firm. (See Have you got a piece of this lawsuit?)\nWhile at least four federal court judges had already found “prima facie” evidence of fraud by the plaintiffs team at the time Burford invested, the quality and quantity of that evidence has strengthened geometrically since the filing of Chevron’s RICO case. Last July U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan in Manhattan ruled that “uncontradicted evidence” showed that the case had been “unquestionably … tainted” by this fraud. (See Chevron claims Patton Boggs tried to cover up a fraud)\nIn addition,Chevron has now also presented in its RICO case substantial evidence indicating that the entire 188-page, $18.2 billion judgment ruling was ghostwritten by the Ecuadorian plaintiffs lawyers themselves—an opportunity that was allegedly accorded to them after they agreed to pay two Ecuadorian judges $500,000 from the anticipated recovery. Chevron has shown, for instance, that at least one third of the judgment was plagiarized from internal plaintiffs memoranda that were never made part of the record in the case, and it has submitted an extensively corroborated affidavit from one of the two Ecuadorian judges in question.\n(In reply, the Lago Agrio plaintiffs team submitted an unnotarized declaration from the other former judge, the titular author of the ruling, Nicolas Zambrano. In it Zambrano says he wrote the ruling himself and denies having accepted any bribe offer. But the Lago Agrio plaintiffs team has also indicated that Zambrano will probably refuse to submit to a deposition backing up his claim, rendering his declaration’s legal value dubious. Further, in his declaration Zambrano makes no attempt to explain away the voluminous corroborating evidence of ghostwriting that Chevron has submitted.\nSimilarly, in a terse, carefully worded affidavit the Lago Agrio plaintiffs’ chief U.S. lawyer Donziger has denied personal involvement in or knowledge of bribery or ghostwriting of the judgment, but has not denied that bribery and ghostwriting may have occurred. The other Amazon Defense Front defendants have defaulted by failing to appear in the RICO suit.)\nFinally, just last week, the plaintiffs team’s environmental experts, Stratus Consulting of Boulder, Colorado, recanted all its scientific findings and conclusions in the case in exchange for being dropped as a defendant in the RICO suit. Its officials expressed regret for having “allowed the firm to be used the way it was.” (The Lago Agrio plaintiffs say Chevron “bullied” Stratus into the recantation by threatening it with “financial extinction.”)\nBy Roger Parloff-Fortune, April 17, 2013", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}
{"id": "2592", "text": "Just 4 days after establishing a TWTR position I had the opportunity to eliminate all cost in the position while still maintaining a potential maximum profit of $6,000. How can a ZERO dollar cost position have a potential $6,000 profit? Keep reading below and you’ll see the answer to that question.\nFirst, I have to admit that the title of this blog is a little misleading. There is a difference between no cost and no risk. No cost refers to the elimination of the original cost/risk of the position. However, as time passes and a zero-cost position (hopefully) builds a profit then the position’s risk is the difference between the open profit and the $0 cost.\nBelow is the risk profile for the TWTR position reflecting the original position plus the 4 adjustments that I made this week. The position began with a $1,960 cost to buy a 20-lot of the Apr17 TWTR 24/20 Put Vertical Debit spreads. That initial position was bought in 2 separate transactions on 3/30 and 3/31. As soon as the position was established I was already planning on reducing cost on both the front and back end of the Vertical spread.\nAfter I had finished establishing the original position on 3/30, I told the Vega Options private twitter followers on a 4/1 tweet that the bearish chart pattern that caused me to initiate a bearish option position was still intact and my open orders to reduce risk were resting below the current price.\nOn 4/2 I was still waiting to reduce the position’s cost but price was taking it’s sweet time moving lower. However, the position had plenty of time duration so, as long as the bearish pattern continued to play out, there was no need for me to rush in getting a fill.\nOn the afternoon of 4/2 I tweeted that price was nearing support and could bounce higher so I wanted to reduce cost to protect the profits the position had already accrued. I mentioned the support zone was 22.30-22.38 and the low price that afternoon was actually 22.36.\nBefore the close on 4/2 I mentioned a couple of likely alternative paths for price to follow. I mentioned that there could be another good opportunity to add to a bearish position if price bounced up into the wave 4 area around 24.15.\nOn the morning of 4/3 TWTR gapped up over 4% and reached a high of 24.32 before selling off immediately after the open. I was able to add to my bearish position which was transaction #5 in the above list.\nNow I am left with the risk profile that you saw at the very beginning of this blog post. I had the opportunity to reduce all of the cost from the position before the close on Friday yet I chose not to. The chart pattern still looks like it has unfinished business to the downside and I would like the opportunity to not just eliminate the cost but to lock in a nice profit with my next adjustment. My current open profit of $1,221 is a 117% return on the position’s current cost of $1,040 so I’m doing just fine in the meantime. No doubt there will be more opportunities to come this week.\nThat is all I have for you now.

{"id": "2625", "text": "We ran for committee person to prompt reform in the Democratic party from the inside. We ran to stop Philadelphia politics as usual—like the situation currently playing out in Philadelphia’s 175th state house district. That’s why we’re calling for a democratic process to replace our democratically elected State Representative.\nOn Wednesday, we learned that Representative Michael O’Brien, the six-term incumbent in the 175th State House district, who just won a contested primary in May, withdrew his name from the November ballot citing health reasons. The Democratic City Committee bylaws state that when a candidate withdraws between the primary and general election, Ward leaders in the affected districts come together within 30 days to vote on a replacement. The Ward leaders’ nomination must then ratified by the Democratic State Committee before that candidate is slotted on the ballot. State Committee is typically deferential to the ward leaders’ pick.\nWe’re asking for an open nomination process, with time for candidates to throw their names in the ring, and an opportunity for committee people to vote on their ward’s endorsement.\nAs reported in the media, the 5th Ward Leader, Michael Boyle, immediately announced his intention to nominate Rep. O’Brien’s long-time Chief of Staff. The vote on her nomination has been called for this Monday, just five days after O’Brien’s announcement, leaving no time for other nominees to surface and no time for committee people in the affected wards to come together or have a voice in the process.\nThe 175th encompasses five wards—the 2nd, 5th, 18th, 25th, and 31st—and includes Old City, parts of Washington Square West and Queen Village, Society Hill, Northern Liberties, Fishtown, and Kensington. These were some of the wards that saw the biggest increases of new, reform-minded committee people in the recent primary.\nWe, along with other committee people from these wards who ran on a reform platform, have signed our names to a letter addressed to the leaders of the 5th, 18th, 25th, and 31st wards asking for them to delay Monday’s unnecessarily rushed vote. (Nikil Saval, leader of the 2nd Ward, already supports delaying the vote.) Under the Democratic Party Bylaws, the Ward leaders have 30 days to come up with a replacement candidate for the ballot. Why the five-day turnaround?\nHelpfully, there’s a direct parallel in neighboring Montgomery County. Madeleine Dean, an incumbent in the 153rd District who won the nomination to run for U.S. Congress in PA’s new 4th District, withdrew her name from November’s ballot. Notably, Dean withdrew her name on July 12th, which is nearly a week earlier than O’Brien withdrew his, yet her replacement won’t be decided until July 31st . Additionally, the committee people in her district will be voting on her replacement. The process from that point on is exactly the same as ours—their vote goes to the Democratic State Committee to be ratified, where it is expected to be approved.\nWe’re asking for this same open nomination process, with time for candidates to throw their names in the ring, and an opportunity for committee people to vote on their ward’s endorsement. At its very core, democracy runs on electoral processes where officials are duly elected by the people they represent. In the absence of this, they should be elected by those peoples’ representatives.\nUntil recently, the Philadelphia Democratic City Committee worked this same way—convening the affected committee people to determine the replacement candidate when a candidate withdrew. That section of the bylaws, unfortunately, was amended in 2014 to disempower elected committee people by leaving the decision entirely in the hands of ward leaders.\nOur desire to serve as committee people is rooted in the belief that our local Democratic party can be—and must be—a more democratic institution. The situation in the 175th is the first test of the Democratic party since roughly half of all committee people seats were won by new candidates. It is also the first test in a midterm year that has been defined nationally by political newcomers running for office, in part, to reconstitute their party from within. So the biggest question now is, Does our local Democratic party want to keep pace with its most energized members, or risk alienating the future of the party?\nVanessa Snyder and Caroline Tiger are elected Democratic committee people in the 2nd and 5th wards.\nCorrection: This story has been amended to reflect Nikil Saval’s support for delaying the vote.", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}
{"id": "2629", "text": "What a strange weekend. We’re not sure whether it was the sun, the alcohol or a combination of both, but we passed out at some point on Saturday afternoon and had the weirdest dream. Leicester City were Premier League champions and, on the day they were presented with the trophy, Andrea Bocelli turned up at the King Power Stadium, dressed in club garb, to serenade Claudio Ranieri and the crowd with Nessun Dorma. They even gave Danny Simpson a medal. That’s the last time we’re drinking in the heat for a while…\nBack to reality and the race for fourth place just got interesting. Rudderless Manchester City, bemused by Manuel Pellegrini’s pre-match team talk – “Yeah, just do what you want. I really don’t give a fuck anymore” – threw away the lead twice against Arsenal to draw 2-2. It’s now OUT OF THEIR HANDS as City wait for Manchester United to play their extra game against West Ham on Tuesday. The Hammers should be up for it, given that it’s the last match at the Boleyn Ground, but then again they were dicked 4-1 at home to Swansea on Saturday and it’s very difficult to play football in flip-flops.\nWith City and United scraping around just to reach August’s Champions League qualifying round, suddenly Arsenal’s failure to win the title this season doesn’t seem all that bad. Amy Lawrence has written here about an achievement not to be sniffed at, as Arsene Wenger prepares to lead the Gunners into the group stage for the 19th consecutive season.\nAway from the hustle and bustle of the Premier League, things were wrapped up in the Championship as well as Leagues One and Two at the weekend. Middlesbrough were held to a 1-1 draw by ten-man Brighton at the Riverside, but that was enough to send them back to the top flight after seven years in the second tier. In League One, Burton followed Wigan up to the Championship. For more on Wigan, who have slipped under the radar somewhat over the past year, read James Ducker’s interview with 24-year-old chairman David Sharpe, grandson of Dave Whelan.\nElsewhere, Blackpool dropped into League Two just five years after their relegation from the Premier League, while Oxford United and Bristol Rovers nabbed the last two automatic promotion places to leapfrog the Seasiders. Accrington Stanley, who we wrote about here, will now face Wimbledon in the League Two play-offs after a gut-wrenching 0-0 draw against Stevenage on the final day.\nAway from the actual action, the most important thing associated with football at the weekend, but that extends far beyond the game itself, was Daniel Gordon’s Hillsborough documentary, which aired on BBC Two on Sunday evening. It tells the story of the tireless dedication of the families of the victims in their 27-year battle for justice, and is essential viewing. You can watch Hillsborough on iPlayer here.\nYou wouldn’t really know it’s a huge week looking at Monday’s listings. For anyone intrigued by the next generation of football stars, the UEFA Under-17 Championship continues in Azerbaijan. England, who are bottom of Group C after losing 2-1 to Sweden on matchday one, face France at 17.00 and you can tune in on British Eurosport.\nMonday: England U17 v France U17, British Eurosport, 17.00\nOn to Tuesday and, although we have a soft spot for the Hibees, who play Falkirk in the Scottish Premiership Play-Off Semi-Final at 19.45, we have a feeling West Ham v Manchester United is going to steal our attention. United simply have to win this one, otherwise they can wave goodbye to the Champions League next season along with Louis van Gaal. If they do win their last two matches (they host Bournemouth on the final day) and follow up with an FA Cup victory over Crystal Palace in a couple of weeks, it doesn’t look a bad season at all on paper. It’s certainly a damn sight better than Jose Mourinho achieved at Chelsea this year, anyway.\nTuesday: West Ham v Manchester United, Sky Sports 1, 19.45\nIt’s not often that Sunderland v Everton is given top billing above Liverpool v Chelsea on Sky Sports, but the Black Cats’ victory against Chelsea on Saturday means they can secure survival on Wednesday night, relegating Newcastle in the process.\nWith Everton going through the motions at the moment, and Roberto Martinez just about clinging to his job, it wouldn’t be a surprise if they didn’t even bother to turn up at the Stadium of Light, instead sending a video message of the team collectively shrugging their shoulders as the ‘walking away’ tune from The Incredible Hulk plays in the background.\nWednesday: Sunderland v Everton, Sky Sports 1, 19.45\nLiverpool v Chelsea, Sky Sports 2, 20.00\nIt's taken 3 years but Everton have finally broken down the most positive man on the planet. https://t.co/Qx6GX1k6Hs\n— Darren (@nsno_83) May 7, 2016\nAnd so to Thursday, and the start of the Football League play-offs.

{"id": "2637", "text": "Voice Over Tips and Best Practices\nVoice over is a great way to convey a message in video. However, if it’s not done well, it can detract from the message instead of supporting it. In this article, we’ll explore a few tips and best practices for producing quality voice over.\nThe first tip is to make sure the script is finished before you begin searching for voice actors. A finished script will ensure that the final result is what you had in mind. Waiting to cast until the script is ready will eliminate the potential for time consuming re-casts, which can lead to frustration both for you and the voice actor.\nBefore you start recording, a good practice is to warm up the vocals. This can be done by humming or singing scales, or even reciting tongue twisters. This will help relax the throat muscles and improve enunciation, which is important for the quality of a voiceover. It will also help the voice artist to feel comfortable in front of the microphone, which is key for an effective recording.\nAnother important tip is to plan where the voice-actor will take a breath. This will prevent them from running out of air mid-sentence, resulting in the awkward sound of “uhm”s and “ahs.” Finally, it’s important to avoid moving too much while recording. This can cause volume inconsistencies and may bump the mic, which could impact the sound quality.\nPacing refers to the speed at which the lines are read, and is important for keeping the audience’s attention.

{"id": "2662", "text": "Every household encounters pests from time to time. Pests –such as ants, cockroaches, fruit flies, and mosquitoes – are common annoyance that inconspicuously roam every corners of a house. Fortunately, there are several ways to control these pests especially if they are starting to become a huge problem by spreading various diseases or damaging your home. One of them is by contacting the closest pest control company in your area. But what if you encountered a very large insect? What will you do?\nRecently, the world’s largest aquatic insect was discovered in China. This type of insect is not the typical species that you often see in a household. It was reportedly a gigantic Dobsonfly, a creature from Megaloptera order of insects. Dobsonfly has a wingspan of 8.3 inches – huge enough to cover one’s face. It’s definitely big, isn’t it? The said creature was seen in the mountains near Chengdu, in the province of Sichuan. Read on and get to know more about this insect!\nCharacteristics of a Megaloptera Insect\nMegaloptera is an order of insects with two families such as Corydalidae and Sialidae (alderflies). The former has two subdivisions which are dobsonflies and fishflies. It has 300 existing species of insects found in every part of the world. Typically, a megaloptera insect is medium to large-sized with a huge wingspan ranging from 20 to 100 mm. Alderflies and dobsonflies can be identified by their long, soft, and flexible bodies. Their bodies are usually dark and they have a large, as well as strong, mandible that they use to grasp and keep their prey.\nMegaloptera adults can be recognized through the huge and fan-folded anal area of their rear wings. Their color ranges from pale yellowish to brownish; some of them have black spots on their bodies too.\nUnlike the other classifications of insects, such as mantodea and diptera that lived in dry places, megaloptera insects are entirely aquatic. They live in wet places such as freshwater streams, lakes, ponds, rivers, and swamps. They can sustain their lives in both still and flowing water. The larvae of megaloptera can be found under clear and cool water while the adult insect can be seen in vegetation areas near streams.\nLife Cycle of a Megaloptera\nAll species of Megaloptera are aquatic and its reproduction happens in wet places such as streams and swamps. An adult megaloptera may lay up to 3000 eggs in water and other places adjacent to it, such as leaves and tree trunks. Shortly after their hatching, the young larvae may fall and crawl into the water and continue to live and grow there. When the larvae reach their maturity, they can leave water and build a home under rocks or logs near marine areas. Their pupal stage often takes place in such areas. The typical life cycle of megaloptera is usually completed in one year in a warm area. An adult megaloptera is short-lived because they normally do not feed even if they drink water.\nEven though mankind have already discovered numerous kinds and types of animals and plants, there are probably plenty that are still yet to be found. Hopefully, the discovery of a giant megaloptera in China will be followed by many more breakthroughs in the future.", "scores": {"score": 3, "score_transform_1": 5, "score_transform_2": 5, "score_transform_3": 0}}
{"id": "2668", "text": "As the pursuit of youthful and radiant skin continues to be a prevalent goal for many, the role of a Skin Rejuvenation Technologist has become increasingly significant. These professionals specialize in employing advanced technologies and techniques to address signs of aging, offering tailored solutions for individuals seeking to turn back the clock on their skin. In this comprehensive guide, we will delve into the pivotal role that Skin Rejuvenation Technologists play in anti-aging treatments.\nUnderstanding the Role of a Skin Rejuvenation Technologist\nA Skin Rejuvenation Technologist is a trained professional who specializes in using various technologies to enhance the appearance of the skin, focusing on reducing the visible signs of aging. These experts are equipped with knowledge in dermatology, skincare, and the latest advancements in rejuvenation treatments. Let’s explore their role below:\n1. In-Depth Skin Analysis\nThe first step in any anti-aging treatment is a thorough analysis of the skin. Skin Rejuvenation Technologists have the expertise to assess skin type, identify specific concerns, and evaluate the overall condition of the skin. This in-depth analysis informs the creation of a personalized treatment plan tailored to address individual needs.\n2. Laser and Light Therapies\nOne of the primary tools in the arsenal of a Skin Rejuvenation Technologist is the use of laser and light therapies. These treatments target various skin issues associated with aging, such as fine lines, wrinkles, and uneven pigmentation. Laser therapies stimulate collagen production, promoting skin elasticity and a more youthful complexion.\n3. Radiofrequency Treatments\nSkin Rejuvenation Technologists often utilize radiofrequency (RF) treatments to address sagging skin and stimulate collagen production. RF technology delivers controlled heat to the deeper layers of the skin, tightening and firming tissues. This results in a lifting effect, reducing the appearance of wrinkles and enhancing overall skin texture.\n4. Chemical Peels\nChemical peels, administered by Skin Rejuvenation Technologists, involve the application of a chemical solution to the skin to exfoliate the outer layer. This process encourages the growth of new, smoother skin, reducing the appearance of fine lines, wrinkles, and age spots. Chemical peels also enhance skin texture and contribute to a more youthful glow.\nSkin Rejuvenation Technologists may perform microdermabrasion, a non-invasive exfoliation technique that removes dead skin cells and stimulates collagen production. This treatment helps reduce fine lines, improve skin texture, and create a more youthful appearance. Microdermabrasion is particularly effective for addressing the early signs of aging.\n6. Injectable Treatments\nWhile not all Skin Rejuvenation Technologists administer injectable treatments, some may be qualified to provide services like Botox and dermal fillers. These treatments target dynamic wrinkles and loss of facial volume, providing a smoother, more youthful look. A qualified technologist will have the necessary training and certifications to perform these procedures safely.\n7. Skincare Recommendations\nIn addition to in-office treatments, Skin Rejuvenation technologists play a crucial role in guiding clients on proper skincare routines. They recommend effective products and skincare regimens tailored to address specific concerns and maintain the results of rejuvenation treatments. This ongoing care is essential for long-term skin health and anti-aging benefits.\n8. Collaboration with Dermatologists and Aesthetic Professionals\nSkin Rejuvenation Technologists often work collaboratively with dermatologists and other aesthetic professionals to ensure comprehensive care. This collaborative approach allows for a combination of treatments that target different aspects of aging, providing clients with optimal results.\n9. Monitoring and Adjusting Treatment Plans\nAnti-aging treatments are not one-time endeavors; they require ongoing monitoring and adjustments. A skilled Skin Rejuvenation Technologist assesses the progress of treatments, listens to client feedback, and makes necessary modifications to the treatment plan to ensure the best possible outcomes.\n10. Patient Education\nEducating clients is a key aspect of a Skin Rejuvenation Technologist’s role. They explain the benefits and potential side effects of treatments, set realistic expectations, and guide post-treatment care. Informed clients are better equipped to make decisions that align with their goals and preferences.\nChoosing Vancoderm Academy of Aesthetic Medicine and Wellness\nFor those aspiring to become skilled Skin Rejuvenation Technologists or pursue a career in aesthetic medicine, Vancoderm Academy stands out as a premier institution. Renowned for its comprehensive programs and experienced faculty, the academy offers a well-rounded education that combines theoretical knowledge with hands-on practical experience.\nVancoderm Academy’s curriculum covers the latest advancements in skincare and rejuvenation techniques, ensuring that graduates are equipped with the skills needed to excel in the rapidly evolving field of aesthetic medicine. The academy’s commitment to excellence and innovation makes it a top choice for individuals seeking a rewarding career in skin rejuvenation and anti-aging treatments.\nIn conclusion, the role of a Skin Rejuvenation Technologist is multifaceted, encompassing in-depth analysis, advanced treatments, patient education, and ongoing care. These professionals are at the forefront of the battle against aging, employing their expertise to help individuals achieve and maintain youthful, revitalized skin. Whether you are considering anti-aging treatments or aspiring to join the ranks of skincare professionals, understanding the pivotal role of Skin Rejuvenation Technologists is essential for informed decision-making and successful outcomes.", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

{"id": "2699", "text": "Unsightly in appearance, dark circles weigh down the gaze and give a tired look. Whether hollow, bluish or pigmented, there are different types depending on associated factors. Among all the existing solutions, you may wonder if tanning helps to conceal them? Here are some elements of response.\nDoes tanning help to conceal dark circles?\n- Tanning, in a nutshell\n- Tanning to camouflage pigmented dark circles?\n- The effect of tanning on vascular dark circles\n- Does tanning help to conceal structural dark circles?\n- How to effectively conceal dark circles?\nTanning, in a nutshell.\nBetween a sun-kissed complexion, a radiant glow, and a moment of relaxation, the benefits of a tanning session are numerous. However, be careful to always protect yourself from UV rays when you expose yourself to the sun by generously applying broad-spectrum sunscreen beforehand on all parts of the body directly exposed to UV rays.\nWhen we tan, our skin pigments due to the synthesis of melanin and takes on a darker hue. At first glance, one might think that this process allows us to even out the colour of our skin, particularly around our eye contour, and thus to camouflage our dark circles. In fact, the effects of tanning on dark circles largely depend on their type.\nTanning to camouflage pigmented dark circles?\nOften of genetic origin, brown dark circles are the result of melanin accumulation around the eye contour. The skin in this area is very thin (about 4 to 5 times more than the rest of the face), which facilitates the penetration of the sun's UV rays. Upon entering the epidermis, these rays stimulate melanogenesis, thus contributing to the brown colouration of dark circles. Therefore, tanning tends to exacerbate pigmented dark circles rather than diminish them.\nThe effect of tanning on vascular dark circles.\nThe bluish dark circles form as a result of a slowdown in blood and lymphatic circulation. The blood pigments transported by these routes then accumulate at the level of the lower eyelid and are poorly evacuated, which gives a blue-purple colour. Tanning provides a brown colouration to the skin which, in the case of vascular dark circles, helps to camouflage them. Indeed, the brown slightly counterbalances the blue of the dark circle in order to unify the complexion.\nDoes tanning help to conceal structural dark circles?\nHollow under-eye circles naturally form over time, as the supporting fibres of the dermis weaken. This weakening, coupled with gravity, leads to the sagging of fat cells and the appearance of a shadow under the eyes. Tanning does not help to conceal this type of under-eye circles, which are more characterised by a structural change than a colour change. Moreover, exposure to UV rays promotes hollow under-eye circles by damaging the fibres of the dermis and accelerating skin ageing.\nHow to effectively conceal dark circles?\nTanning thus appears to be a rather uncertain and limited method for concealing dark circles, in addition to being dangerous for skin health. If you wish to effectively mask them, we instead recommend that you turn towards a tinted product such as a concealer.\nAt Typology, we offer a 2-in-1 product that provides instant visual correction and helps to reduce dark circles over time. Our tinted under-eye concealer comes in six shades and offers a natural finish. It is enriched with caffeine and cornflower hydrosol (INCI: Centaurea Cyanus Flower Water), ingredients that have a draining and decongesting effect and help to improve microcirculation.", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}

{"id": "2704", "text": "When it comes to the manufacturing of containers, ensuring quality and reliability is paramount. Before our containers are ready for delivery to customers, a series of rigorous tests are conducted to guarantee their integrity and safety. In this article, we’ll delve into the key tests that are performed to ensure the containers meet international safety standards and can withstand the harshest conditions.\nWelding inspection is a fundamental step in the manufacturing process of containers. It goes beyond merely examining the final product; it is an ongoing process that ensures the quality of welds throughout the container’s construction. This inspection includes Non-Destructive Testing (NDT) to identify any potential weaknesses. By adhering to stringent welding standards and conducting continuous inspections, structural issues are prevented.\nIn addition to meeting the requirements outlined by international container safety conventions, we also carry out specialized lifting tests for offshore containers according to the DNV2.7-1. This includes the two tests:\n- Four-Point Lifting Test: In this test, the focus is on assessing the container’s load-bearing capacity. The objective is to confirm that the container can be safely lifted without undergoing permanent deformation. This is tested by loading the container up to a total gross mass of 2.5 × R, where R is the maximum allowable combined mass of the container and its cargo. The container should be lifted with a lifting sling set attached to each of its four pad eyes with an angle to the vertical equal to the design angle. After the lifting, the container shall show no significant permanent deformations or other damages.\n- Two-Point Lifting Test: This test assesses the container’s ability to resist deformation while being suspended from only two points. This is done using two lifting lugs positioned diagonally opposite each other, with a total mass of 1.5 × R. If the container is unsymmetrical, two diagonal lifting tests will be required. Like the four-point lifting, the container shall show no permanent deformation or signs of damage after the test.\nMoreover, a drop test is performed to assess how an offshore container handles free fall. Thus, this test comprises that the offshore container shall be suspended from a quick-release hook. When released, the offshore container shall drop freely for at least 5 cm, to give it a speed at an initial impact of at least 1 m/s. After testing, the offshore container shall not show significant permanent deformation or damage. The drop test is crucial in guaranteeing that containers arrive at their destination in perfect condition, regardless of the handling they experience during transit.\nEnsuring that containers remain watertight is essential. That is why containers undergo a high-pressure water test, spraying them from all angles. Afterward, thorough checks are conducted to verify that no water has penetrated the container. This test is a vital part of safeguarding the contents from damage due to exposure to moisture during transport and storage.\nIn conclusion, these rigorous tests are the foundation of container quality control. By conducting these tests, potential structural issues can be identified in advance, thereby minimizing the risk of accidents occurring during operation. This not only protects the safety of personnel but also diminishes potential property damage!\nAt Uniteam, our dedication lies in delivering top-notch container solutions.

This guide delves deep into the nuances of using epoxy for cast iron repair, unraveling its step-by-step application and ensuring that your cast iron remains an enduring piece of history.\nAlso read: How to Test Auto-Darkening Welding Helmets\n1. Identify and Assess the Damage\nEvery repair begins with a thorough assessment. Check the cast iron piece carefully, feeling for any discrepancies in the surface and visually inspecting for cracks or breaks. Not all damage is immediately apparent; sometimes a small surface crack can be deeper than it appears. Using a magnifying glass can help identify hairline cracks that are otherwise easy to miss. Making a comprehensive assessment is key, as this will dictate how much work needs to be done and how much epoxy you’ll need.\n2. Clean the Damaged Area\nA successful repair hinges on the adhesion of the epoxy. Begin by removing superficial dirt or dust with a soft cloth. Use a wire brush to scrub away any rust or lingering debris that could compromise the bond. If the piece is particularly dirty, soak it in a solution of soap and water. For very stubborn grease spots or old adhesive residues, dab a cloth in acetone and gently rub the spot until clean. After cleaning, rinse the piece thoroughly with water and dry it completely, ensuring no moisture remains.\nAlso read: What Shade Lens for Mig Welding\n3. Choose the Right Epoxy\nThe market is flooded with a variety of epoxies, each tailored for different applications. For cast iron, seek an epoxy labeled for metal or specifically for iron. If the iron piece will be exposed to high temperatures (like engine parts or stovetop cookware), a high-temperature epoxy is mandatory. It’s worth investing in a reputable brand, as the quality of the epoxy will directly influence the longevity and strength of the repair.\n4. Mix the Epoxy\nEpoxy typically consists of a resin and a hardener. When mixed, they undergo a chemical reaction that leads to hardening. While mixing, ensure you’re in a well-ventilated space. Pour equal parts of the resin and hardener into a mixing tray, using separate sticks to scoop them out to avoid contamination. Stir them together until you achieve a consistent texture. The mixture should be even in color and free of any streaks.\n5. Apply the Epoxy\nWith your epoxy prepared, start the application process. If dealing with a crack, ensure the epoxy fills it entirely. Using a spatula, palette knife, or even a flat wooden stick, spread the epoxy over and into the damaged areas. For areas requiring a thicker application, consider building the epoxy in layers. This will reduce the risk of the epoxy forming bubbles or gaps, ensuring a more solid repair.\n6. Allow the Epoxy to Cure\nPatience is key during this step. While many epoxies might feel firm to touch within a few hours, they continue to harden and bond over a more extended period. Store the piece in a dry, temperate environment away from direct sunlight. This will give the epoxy the best chance to cure without interference. Avoid the temptation to test the repair’s strength prematurely; doing so can weaken the bond.\nAlso read: What is Tack Welding\n7. Sand and Finish\nThe final step is about aesthetics and ensuring a smooth finish. Use coarse sandpaper to start, focusing on any raised or uneven epoxy areas. As these even out, transition to finer sandpaper grades to achieve a smooth and refined texture. Depending on the piece’s intended use, you can finish with paint or a protective sealant, ensuring your repair not only holds but also blends seamlessly with the rest of the cast iron.\nAlso read: What is Peening in Welding\nHaving a trusted ally in the form of epoxy for cast iron repair is invaluable. It bridges the gap between preservation and innovation. By understanding and applying the steps meticulously, one can ensure that their cast iron pieces, whether antiques or functional tools maintain their durability and charm. In an age where sustainability and repair are increasingly valued, knowing how to effectively use epoxy to restore cast iron is not just a skill; it’s a testament to our commitment to preserving history and minimizing waste.", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}

{"id": "2943", "text": "We conduct a large-scale fine-grained comparative analysis of machine translations (MT) against human translations (HT) through the lens of morphosyntactic divergence. Across three language pairs and two types of divergence defined as the structural difference between the source and the target, MT is consistently more conservative than HT, with less morphosyntactic diversity, more convergent patterns, and more one-to-one alignments. Through analysis on different decoding algorithms, we attribute this discrepancy to the use of beam search that biases MT towards more convergent patterns. This bias is most amplified when the convergent pattern appears around 50% of the time in training data. Lastly, we show that for a majority of morphosyntactic divergences, their presence in HT is correlated with decreased MT performance, presenting a greater challenge for MT systems.\nMaximum-a-posteriori (MAP) decoding is the most widely used decoding strategy for neural machine translation (NMT) models. The underlying assumption is that model probability correlates well with human judgment, with better translations being more likely. However, research has shown that this assumption does not always hold, and decoding strategies which directly optimize a utility function, like Minimum Bayes Risk (MBR) or Quality-Aware decoding can significantly improve translation quality over standard MAP decoding. The main disadvantage of these methods is that they require an additional model to predict the utility, and additional steps during decoding, which makes the entire process computationally demanding. In this paper, we propose to make the NMT models themselves quality-aware by training them to estimate the quality of their own output. During decoding, we can use the model's own quality estimates to guide the generation process and produce the highest-quality translations possible. We demonstrate that the model can self-evaluate its own output during translation, eliminating the need for a separate quality estimation model. Moreover, we show that using this quality signal as a prompt during MAP decoding can significantly improve translation quality. When using the internal quality estimate to prune the hypothesis space during MBR decoding, we can not only further improve translation quality, but also reduce inference speed by two orders of magnitude.\nData scarcity is a crucial issue for the development of highly multilingual NLP systems. Yet for many under-represented languages (ULs) -- languages for which NLP re-search is particularly far behind in meeting user needs -- it is feasible to annotate small amounts of data. Motivated by this, we propose XTREME-UP, a benchmark defined by: its focus on the scarce-data scenario rather than zero-shot; its focus on user-centric tasks -- tasks with broad adoption by speakers of high-resource languages; and its focus on under-represented languages where this scarce-data scenario tends to be most realistic. XTREME-UP evaluates the capabilities of language models across 88 under-represented languages over 9 key user-centric technologies including ASR, OCR, MT, and information access tasks that are of general utility. We create new datasets for OCR, autocomplete, semantic parsing, and transliteration, and build on and refine existing datasets for other tasks. XTREME-UP provides methodology for evaluating many modeling scenarios including text-only, multi-modal (vision, audio, and text),supervised parameter tuning, and in-context learning. We evaluate commonly used models on the benchmark. We release all code and scripts to train and evaluate models\nWe introduce PaLM 2, a new state-of-the-art language model that has better multilingual and reasoning capabilities and is more compute-efficient than its predecessor PaLM. PaLM 2 is a Transformer-based model trained using a mixture of objectives. Through extensive evaluations on English and multilingual language, and reasoning tasks, we demonstrate that PaLM 2 has significantly improved quality on downstream tasks across different model sizes, while simultaneously exhibiting faster and more efficient inference compared to PaLM. This improved efficiency enables broader deployment while also allowing the model to respond faster, for a more natural pace of interaction. PaLM 2 demonstrates robust reasoning capabilities exemplified by large improvements over PaLM on BIG-Bench and other reasoning tasks. PaLM 2 exhibits stable performance on a suite of responsible AI evaluations, and enables inference-time control over toxicity without additional overhead or impact on other capabilities. Overall, PaLM 2 achieves state-of-the-art performance across a diverse set of tasks and capabilities. When discussing the PaLM 2 family, it is important to distinguish between pre-trained models (of various sizes), fine-tuned variants of these models, and the user-facing products that use these models. In particular, user-facing products typically include additional pre- and post-processing steps. Additionally, the underlying models may evolve over time. Therefore, one should not expect the performance of user-facing products to exactly match the results reported in this report.\nLarge, multilingual language models exhibit surprisingly good zero- or few-shot machine translation capabilities, despite having never seen the intentionally-included translation examples provided to typical neural translation systems. We investigate the role of incidental bilingualism -- the unintentional consumption of bilingual signals, including translation examples -- in explaining the translation capabilities of large language models, taking the Pathways Language Model (PaLM) as a case study. We introduce a mixed-method approach to measure and understand incidental bilingualism at scale. We show that PaLM is exposed to over 30 million translation pairs across at least 44 languages. Furthermore, the amount of incidental bilingual content is highly correlated with the amount of monolingual in-language content for non-English languages. We relate incidental bilingual content to zero-shot prompts and show that it can be used to mine new prompts to improve PaLM's out-of-English zero-shot translation quality. Finally, in a series of small-scale ablations, we show that its presence has a substantial impact on translation capabilities, although this impact diminishes with model scale.\nWe demonstrate the potential of few-shot translation systems, trained with unpaired language data, for both high and low-resource language pairs. We show that with only 5 examples of high-quality translation data shown at inference, a transformer decoder-only model trained solely with self-supervised learning, is able to match specialized supervised state-of-the-art models as well as more general commercial translation systems. In particular, we outperform the best performing system on the WMT'21 English - Chinese news translation task by only using five examples of English - Chinese parallel data at inference. Moreover, our approach in building these models does not necessitate joint multilingual training or back-translation, is conceptually simple and shows the potential to extend to the multilingual setting. Furthermore, the resulting models are two orders of magnitude smaller than state-of-the-art language models. We then analyze the factors which impact the performance of few-shot translation systems, and highlight that the quality of the few-shot demonstrations heavily determines the quality of the translations generated by our models. Finally, we show that the few-shot paradigm also provides a way to control certain attributes of the translation -- we show that we are able to control for regional varieties and formality using only a five examples at inference, paving the way towards controllable machine translation systems.\nLarge language models (LLMs) that have been trained on multilingual but not parallel text exhibit a remarkable ability to translate between languages. We probe this ability in an in-depth study of the pathways language model (PaLM), which has demonstrated the strongest machine translation (MT) performance among similarly-trained LLMs to date. We investigate various strategies for choosing translation examples for few-shot prompting, concluding that example quality is the most important factor. Using optimized prompts, we revisit previous assessments of PaLM's MT capabilities with more recent test sets, modern MT metrics, and human evaluation, and find that its performance, while impressive, still lags that of state-of-the-art supervised systems. We conclude by providing an analysis of PaLM's MT output which reveals some interesting properties and prospects for future work.\nWe introduce XTREME-S, a new benchmark to evaluate universal cross-lingual speech representations in many languages. XTREME-S covers four task families: speech recognition, classification, speech-to-text translation and retrieval. Covering 102 languages from 10+ language families, 3 different domains and 4 task families, XTREME-S aims to simplify multilingual speech representation evaluation, as well as catalyze research in \"universal\" speech representation learning. This paper describes the new benchmark and establishes the first speech-only and speech-text baselines using XLS-R and mSLAM on all downstream tasks. We motivate the design choices and detail how to use the benchmark. Datasets and fine-tuning scripts are made easily accessible at https://hf.co/datasets/google/xtreme_s.\n* Minor fix: language code for Filipino (Tagalog), \"tg\" -> \"tl\"\nEnd-to-end speech-to-speech translation (S2ST) without relying on intermediate text representations is a rapidly emerging frontier of research. Recent works have demonstrated that the performance of such direct S2ST systems is approaching that of conventional cascade S2ST when trained on comparable datasets. However, in practice, the performance of direct S2ST is bounded by the availability of paired S2ST training data. In this work, we explore multiple approaches for leveraging much more widely available unsupervised and weakly-supervised speech and text data to improve the performance of direct S2ST based on Translatotron 2. With our most effective approaches, the average translation quality of direct S2ST on 21 language pairs on the CVSS-C corpus is improved by +13.6 BLEU (or +113% relatively), as compared to the previous state-of-the-art trained without additional data. The improvements on low-resource language are even more significant (+398% relatively on average). Our comparative studies suggest future research directions for S2ST and speech representation learning.\nIn this work, we study the effect of varying the architecture and training data quality on the data scaling properties of Neural Machine Translation (NMT). First, we establish that the test loss of encoder-decoder transformer models scales as a power law in the number of training samples, with a dependence on the model size. Then, we systematically vary aspects of the training setup to understand how they impact the data scaling laws. In particular, we change the following (1) Architecture and task setup: We compare to a transformer-LSTM hybrid, and a decoder-only transformer with a language modeling loss (2) Noise level in the training distribution: We experiment with filtering, and adding iid synthetic noise. In all the above cases, we find that the data scaling exponents are minimally impacted, suggesting that marginally worse architectures or training data can be compensated for by adding more data. Lastly, we find that using back-translated data instead of parallel data, can significantly degrade the scaling exponent.", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

{"id": "2984", "text": "Thanks to the Vourderis family, the Wonder Wheel, constructed in 1920, has continuously operated longer than any other amusement in Coney Island. The Wheel is much more than an amusement ride. It's a work of art and the ultimate survivor in an ephemeral world, a link to Coney's remarkable past. And its origins can be traced to the work of Leonardo da Vinci.\nTwo years ago the Coney Island History Project and the Vourderis family were planning major events for the Wonder Wheel's 100th anniversary, a milestone that no other Coney Island attraction had ever achieved. In late 2018, I began research for a book and an exhibit that would celebrate this momentous occasion, and found a publisher who could fast-track the book's release in time for the centennial.\nAt the time, very little was known about the origins of the Wheel, the man who designed it, and how it came to be. I began by tracking down the family of Charles Hermann, the idealistic steelworker and inventor of the Wheel whose quest for a perpetual motion machine led to his partnership with businessman Herman Garms. The two immigrant dreamers traveled to Coney Island and proposed their odd project to pioneer landowner William Ward. The unlikely partnership the three formed would finance and build the Wonder Wheel.\nI was able to find and interview far-flung members of the Garms family as well as Charles Hermann's 95-year-old daughter, who provided a firsthand account of her father's work. All of the families provided archival material and stories for the book and planned to travel from all over the country to attend the 2020 celebration.\nAnd then COVID hit and the planning came to a screeching halt. My book, Coney Island's Wonder Wheel Park, came out in August, but Coney Island’s amusements were closed by state executive order and all celebrations were postponed. Uncertainties continued into 2021 and we were left hanging, wondering if the Wonder Wheel story could be told.\nEarly this year we realized that an indoor exhibit would be prohibitive and decided to redesign the exhibit as a condensed outdoor display using traditional banners. Finally there's an exhibit that tells the remarkable story of the Wonder Wheel and the family that operates Deno's Wonder Wheel Park. The colorful history banners are located on the Wheel's walkway adjacent to the History Project, as well as below Deno's new Phoenix Roller Coaster on West 12th Street. It's a riveting story about families, immigrant initiative, love, and hard work. -- Charles Denson\nCelebrating 101 years! See 'The Wonder Wheel and the Immigrant Dream,' the Coney Island History Project's free outdoor exhibition of banners on view from July through the end of October 2021 at Deno's Wonder Wheel Amusement Park.

While Álvarez provided the big hit, Jake Odorizzi was at his best and worked seven scoreless innings to hold Seattle’s hitters for the biggest part of the game.\nOdorizzi was in total control throughout his entire outing. He allowed two singles, walked two hitters, and struck out eight. He didn’t get a decision, but played a key role on the result.\nOdo had 15 swings and misses to tie his personal-best as an Astro – the other time he caused 15 whiffs was on July 10, when he threw seven scoreless innings as well with seven punchouts against the Athletics. This time, Odorizzi’s fastball averaged 92.7 miles per hour, 0.6 above his 2022 average (92.1).\nFantastic performance by Jake Odorizzi!— Apollo Media (@ApolloHOU) July 31, 2022\nHere are his 8 strikeouts.pic.twitter.com/EYkv5xDf7y\nOffensively, the game started with Mariners’ starter George Kirby plunking José Altuve with a 95-mph fastball. Right after that, Yuli Gurriel singled to get Altuve to third base, and then, magic happened. The Astros pulled off a double steal, with Altuve swiping home plate to crack the scoreboard 1-0. Seconds later, Kyle Tucker brought Gurriel home with an RBI single to make it 2-0.\nYou come for the throne, you best not miss. pic.twitter.com/b73B8BPOgI— Houston Astros (@astros) July 31, 2022\nThe Astros didn’t do much more beyond the first inning. In fact, Houston got zero hits across 14 at-bats from hitters six to nine including replacements.\nAfter Odorizzi’s performance was over, Ryne Stanek allowed a game-tying, two-run home run to Jesse Winker in the eighth. Ryan Pressly pitched the ninth and Erik Swanson did the same to take us to extras. Then, Héctor Neris was great in the 10th inning, punching out two hitters and serving the table for Yordan’s big hit.\nWith Mauricio Dubón running on second, the Mariners walked José Altuve intentionally and retired Gurriel on a lineout. After one pitch from reliever Brennan Bernardino, Álvarez knocked his third career walk-off hit with an opposite-field single.\nAs an additional info, Gurriel recorded his 30th double of the season and is on pace for 47. So far, only five Astros players have reached that mark in a campaign: Altuve, Craig Biggio, Jeff Bagwell, Alex Bregman, and Lance Berkman. Besides, Yordan’s 10th-inning RBI was his 70th of 2022.\nNow, the Astros get ready to host the Red Sox for a three-game series at Minute Maid Park.

{"id": "3043", "text": "Do you know the difference between discount dental plans vs dental insurance? The difference is like the difference between paying full price and getting a nice big discount. No matter how you look at it, these are two different plans, each with their own benefits and restrictions. If you are considering any type of dental plan for yourself, your family or your group, think about which option is the best overall choice for you.\nWatch This Video “Discount Dental Plans vs Dental Insurance”\nThe Basics of Dental Plans\nInsurance is a product that is provided and paid into to provide coverage for a number of conditions. You need service, you contact the insurance provider if you don’t have one, why not try these out and get the necessary information and approval, then move on to finding the dentist to do the work. Once you have the approved work done, the dentist must submit their claim to the insurance company who tells you just how much of a deductible you have to pay. It may be some or the entire price of the service. There is no discount here, it’s full price.\nWith discount dental plans, on the other hand, things are a bit different. You visit an approved dental provider for whatever service you are looking for. If that service is one that is on your plan, you receive a big discount, from 10% on up to 60% of the overall cost of the procedure. All you have to do to get this discount is to simply show your dental discount card to the provider. It’s very simple.\nOther Things You Should Know About Dental Insurance\nTo fully understand the difference in these products for your dental care, consider a few more details about them. For example, with dental insurance, there are often many limitations on the services that you can have and there are often annual maximums that limit their use. If you plan to have a major procedure you may actually have to wait for a period of time for approval. Of course, you’ll have to pay rather high premiums for the services that you get from dental insurance as well. In most cases, people get dental insurance only when it’s provided through their employer as individual and family plans are often quite expensive to purchase privately.\nA big difference between dental discount plans vs dental insurance is that of cosmetic dentistry. Today, one of the biggest reasons people visit the dentist is not just for their cleanings and exams, but also for needs like professional teeth whitening and getting other cosmetic procedures done. The problem is that most dental insurance plans don’t offer any coverage for those procedures. You may not be able to afford them then. These things make dental insurance quite expensive considering the limits placed on you.\nOn the other hand, you will find there are even more benefits to choosing the right plan for you. Dental discount plans vs dental insurance should be considered for these things as well. For example, there are few limits on the amount of use you can use per year with a discount plan. There is a large difference in the amount of paper work and hassles with discount plans as well as no health restrictions for those that can use them. Many of the better plans offer coverage that includes cosmetic dentistry as well as specialists for conditions such as TMJ needs, orthodontics and others.\nBest of all, virtually anyone can have these plans as they are affordable alternatives. Even individual dental plans can be had at an affordable rate without any ties to an employer.\nShould you give up your dental insurance then? You don’t have to give it up, especially if your employer is providing it. However, you should consider the benefits of having a discount dental plan at any point. There are many reasons why you will want to consider it. Just think about how many extra dollars you would have in your pocket for the dental care that you have paid for over the course of your lifetime that you could have gotten a discount on.\nEven more so, you don’t have to limit yourself to those procedures with your dental insurance plan offers. Now you can have the best smile based on your needs. You just need to consider the major differences between discount dental plans vs dental insurance and how they affect your individual needs.\nFor more information, or to find a participating dentist near you, simply enter your zip code at Discount Dental Plans or in the light blue box at the top of the page.

{"id": "3046", "text": "If you like Punish Yourself, Rammstein, Combichrist, Rob Zombie, a passage through the Shaârghot box is mandatory. The Shaârghot opened his manhole to tell us more about his history…\nHello. Many thanks to take your time to answer few questions for Distrolution. Typical ask I know, but could you introduce yourself and your band?\nHi guys! I’m Etienne, the singer and compositor of the group. I’m also the one who give his body to Shaârghot. Shaârghot come from a wish to hear things that I didn’t find in the Electro indus scene. Except Punish Yourself I didn’t see other band who mix Electro and Metal as well, and mostly band who gives a real show on stage! After a long time of unsuccessful searches, I said to myself: “hey, and if I do this by myself just to see?” And here we are ahah!\nCan you tell us more about Shaârghot‘s character?\nHe’s a human who muted, a failed scientific experiment in a future world, a cyber punk world. We evolve in a purely dystopian world. The human was too curious, and he has been sent in a camp where he was used as a test subject. After the experiment, he finally became this thing; a part of his memory was gone, he doesn’t remember who he was before. There’s just a sick part of his brain, which called herself “The Shaârghot” and which possess regenerative capacities, an increase strength, etc. So, we were in front of something not really happy to be here, in a vat, extremely strong. He caused an incredible shitstorm; he escaped, and he lives now in the undergrounds of the city. He began to create a lot of little friends like him thanks to his blood, because he just has to inoculate his blood to someone to infect her with the same black parasite that cover their skin.\nThere’s a lot of staging around Shaârghot, where does the inspiration come from?\nMy inspiration principally comes from the famous bands like Rob Zombie, Punish yourself, Combichrist, or Rammstein. These bands are really interesting to see on stage, and it’s not just music, there’s a real show, a universe. It’s a complete show, and I wanted to create something like that too.\nCan you tell us a little more about your musical background and your composition process?\nI principally come from the Electro Industrial scene. I’ve always had a lot of affection for big synthesizers, and the dance floor kicks, but this musical genre needs more aggressiveness to my mind, and as there’s a lot of things I like in Metal, I chose to hybridize these two styles. For the composition, I write every text, and I compose 80/90% of the music. I come with an idea of what the guitars and the drums will do, what sound of the synthesizer I want, I know the most part of all these things but sometimes it works perfectly in my head and not at all in reality. So, I know that I’m not infallible and if the rest of the band has some ideas, they will propose new things and we will see together if these ideas make the piece of music better or not. That’s when it’s necessary to put his ego aside and admit that the proposed riff is more interesting than mine, it serves the music better. I know exchange with others ideas if I think they are good and interesting for our work. The idea is to create good titles that we enjoy to listen and to play. And the main goal is the stage. These songs are made to be played on stage and for people to dance and mosh on it.\nEach band has its own influences, what are yours?\nOh, there are so many! I have already listed some of them just above, but my influences come from all directions. We can find psytrance with bands like Mangadrive, Infected mushrooms, or more experimental bands like Sonic Area. And in fact, I can’t make an itw without talking about Punish Yourself ahah!\nLet’s talk about “Break your body”. Can you tell us about the artwork? Its concept, which created it, etc.\nThe artwork is made by Lyan, a young illustrator really talented. I have worked with her since almost the beginning of Shaârghot. I wanted to represent a daily scene in the life of the Shaârghot, but not only. The first you can see is the stupid and wicked face “baseball bat in your head”, but the title Break your body has another message to transmit: there’s a wish to free the body, unleash people and run out of the taboos. In fact, what is a “Shadow” ? They’re not just people who are contaminated by the parasite, the transformation goes beyond that. The psychology of Shadows is modified, they become totally destitute of mental barriers: there are no more restrictions, no more taboos, every code that the society imposed are broken… These creatures are totally free in their mind, for better and…for worst! Every time they have something to do in mind, even if it’s unthinking or stupid, they do it. Even if it’s violent or with positive intention, they do it…They are random creatures who have totally let go. Shaârghot asks for let go, do what you want and after, the first embodiment, it’s a baseball bat in your head. In short, Break your body is an invitation to happily break your bones and break free.\nWhere did you record this opus and do you have an anecdote to share with our readers about the recording of « Break Your Body » ?\nAhahah, I think that the place where I recorded the voices is already hardcore! I recorded it in a clothes locker, because the clothes made a good sound insulation! In fact, we do everything with pieces of strings; we record, compose and create everything in bedrooms; we just don’t have studio.\nI know you‘re working on a second album, will it be a sequel to “Break your body”?\nAbsolutely, but I can’t tell you more for the moment.\nYou are very well received and appreciated also in concerts, can you tell us your best memory about live stage?\nOne of our best memory is a particularly violent concert at the Gibus in Paris; it was like we were playing in front of a hive of bees, people were moving so much! They were really excited and they gave us so much that after two titles the room was like a furnace! I ask myself who will be tired in first between them and us ahah! I also remember that some people grabbed our performer Skarskin and throwed him further on stage. At the end the emergency services come to bring round someone and the fuses of the room have blown during the last title, but we didn’t care it was a really great concert!\nAny last word for your fans?\nI love turkeys!", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

It's such a great question.\nAre you inviting joy into your life not just with objects, but people, food, or circumstances? Or are you inviting sadness, misery, and guilt? And if you are, then ask yourself \"where will I find joy?\" and head over to that party.\nJoy is at the top of the food chain so to speak and fear is at the bottom with every emotion and state of being existing in between. In order to get to joy, the movement has to start somewhere.\nFor me, the simple yet profound question \"Does this spark joy?\" is where I began. If it doesn't spark joy, then it's holding me back from that place I choose to live from.

{"id": "3064", "text": "Rh factor blood test\nMedically reviewed by Drugs.com. Last updated on Jul 29, 2022.\nRh factor is an inherited protein found on the surface of red blood cells. If your blood has the protein, you're Rh positive. If your blood doesn't have the protein, you're Rh negative. The \"+\" or \"–\" you might see after your blood type refers to Rh positive or Rh negative.\nRh positive is much more common than Rh negative. Having an Rh negative blood type is not an illness, and it usually does not affect your health. But it can affect pregnancy. Your pregnancy needs special care if you're Rh negative and your baby is Rh positive. That's called Rh incompatibility. A baby can inherit the Rh factor from either parent.\nYour health care provider will advise that you have a blood type and Rh factor screening test during your first prenatal visit. This will show whether you are Rh positive or Rh negative.\nWhy it's done\nDuring pregnancy, problems can happen if you're Rh negative and your baby is Rh positive. Usually, your blood doesn't mix with your baby's blood during pregnancy. However, a small amount of your baby's blood could come in contact with your blood when the baby is born. It can also happen if you have bleeding or trauma to your abdomen during pregnancy.\nIf you're Rh negative and your baby is Rh positive, your body might produce proteins called Rh antibodies if your blood and the baby's blood mix. Those antibodies aren't a problem during the first pregnancy. But problems can happen if you become pregnant again.\nIf your next baby is Rh positive, the Rh antibodies can cross the placenta and damage the baby's red blood cells. This could lead to life-threatening anemia, a condition in which red blood cells are destroyed faster than the baby's body can replace them. Red blood cells are needed to carry oxygen throughout the body.\nIf you're Rh negative, you might need to have another blood test — called an antibody screen — several times: during your first trimester, during week 28 of pregnancy and when your baby is born. Some people need the test more often.\nThat test is used to detect antibodies to Rh positive blood. If you haven't started to produce Rh antibodies, you'll likely need a shot (injection) of a blood product called Rh immune globulin. This prevents your body from producing Rh antibodies during your pregnancy.\nIf your baby is born Rh negative, you don't need any other treatment. If your baby is born Rh positive, you'll need another injection shortly after delivery.\nIf you're Rh negative and your baby might be or is Rh positive, your health care provider may recommend an Rh immune globulin injection after situations in which your blood could come into contact with the baby's blood, including:\n- Ectopic pregnancy — when a fertilized eggs implants somewhere outside the uterus, usually in a fallopian tube\n- Removal of a molar pregnancy — a noncancerous (benign) tumor that develops in the uterus\n- Amniocentesis — a prenatal test in which a sample of the fluid that surrounds and protects a baby in the uterus (amniotic fluid) is removed for testing or treatment\n- Chorionic villus sampling — a prenatal test in which a sample of the wispy projections that make up most of the placenta (chorionic villi) is removed for testing\n- Cordocentesis — a prenatal test in which a sample of the baby's blood is removed from the umbilical cord for testing\n- Bleeding during pregnancy\n- Injury or other trauma to your abdomen during pregnancy\n- The external manual rotation of a baby in a breech position — such as buttocks first — before labor\nIf the antibody screen shows that you're already producing antibodies, an injection of Rh immune globulin won't help. Your baby will be carefully monitored during your pregnancy. The baby might be given a blood transfusion through the umbilical cord during pregnancy or immediately after delivery if necessary.\n|Mother's Rh factor\n|Father's Rh factor\n|Baby's Rh factor\n|Could be Rh positive or Rh negative\n|Could be Rh positive or Rh negative\n|Rh immune globulin injections\nWhat you can expect\nAn Rh factor test is a basic blood test. The blood sample usually is taken during the first prenatal visit and sent to a lab for testing. No special preparation is necessary.\nIf you're Rh positive, you don't need to do anything.\nIf you're Rh negative and your baby is Rh positive, your body could make antibodies that might be harmful during another pregnancy. Take these steps:\n- If you have vaginal bleeding any time during pregnancy, contact your health care provider right away.\n- Talk with your health care provider about scheduling an Rh immune globulin injection during your pregnancy.\n- Remind your health care team during labor that you're Rh negative.", "scores": {"score": 3, "score_transform_1": 5, "score_transform_2": 5, "score_transform_3": 0}}

{"id": "3081", "text": "Source: Santa Ynez Valley Riders\nIn a first for Santa Barbara County trails, a group of women equestrian trail riders, members of the Santa Ynez Valley Riders and Live Oak Trail Patrol, met on Tuesday, just prior to Trails Day, to reduce weeds in the vicinity of the Live Oak Trailhead kiosk and clear brush along the entry trail.\nThe group uses a new approach to trail maintenance, with various assignments that provide volunteers of all ages, skills and abilities to participate. Timing of trail maintenance days considers the most advantageous time to do the work, and to remove invasive weeds before they set seed thus avoiding the proliferation of millions of new weedy plants the following year – in other words, to plan ahead.\n“We are gentle with ourselves and listen to the land. Too many traditional trail maintenance techniques disturb the soil and surrounding vegetation to the extent that natural features such as rocks, bushes and small trees are removed creating what are becoming wide freeways through our forests, woodlands, and grasslands rather than trails. The wider, flatter trails and their repetitive maintenance requirements are easily eroded and become magnets for invasive weeds.” commented Kathy Rosenthal, the group’s organizer.\nInstead of the usual “blow and go” method, the group does a little bit of trail work at a time, usually 1-2 hours in the cool, early morning hours when it is exceptionally beautiful at the trailhead. It works better for the volunteers and is less disruptive to neighboring wildlife. Keeping the work footprint small and focused also allows the group to do quality work, minimally disturbing the area surrounding the trail.\nEquestrian trail riders have ridden Live Oak Trail for the last 30 years and it was part of the Rancho San Marcos for hundreds of years before that. In all that time, very few incidents requiring trail maintenance occurred. Opening the trail last year to hikers has presented a new set of challenges that the County Parks Division was not prepared to take on. This group will fill that void and restore the historic trail for what hiking and equestrian riding enthusiasts look for in this wild and remote area: to safely enjoy the peace and beauty of nature.\nLive Oak Trail is open to equestrians and hikers. Bicycles, motor vehicles, or dogs (on or off leash) are not allowed. A $10 per car day use fee is required (and remember to bring exact change). Be sure and carry plenty of water as shade trees have recently been blocked off and are excluded from the public’s use. Temperatures can be extreme. Please obey all trail rules, be courteous, and respectfully enjoy this special place.", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}

{"id": "3092", "text": "There is a tide in the affairs of men, Which taken at the flood, leads on to fortune. Omitted, all the voyage of their life is bound in shallows and in miseries. On such a full sea are we now afloat. And we must take the current when it serves, or lose our ventures.Shakespeare\nFor several years commentators have been sounding alarm bells about South Africa’s steadily rising debt whilst economic growth has stalled. As the Minister himself put it: “Our problem is that we spend more than we earn. It is as simple as that”. On top of that State Owned Enterprises (SOEs) have been poorly led and even more poorly governed as President Ramaphosa recently said that R500 billion has gone missing due to state capture.\nThis has put our debt past 50% of GDP (from the low twenties a decade ago), nonproductive government spending has risen, salaries now account for 35% of state expenditure and low economic growth stifles tax collections. In addition, Eskom has received extra funding of R52 billion this year. As they say, something has to give.\nThere have already been consequences as two of the three major ratings agencies (Fitch and S&P) have downgraded South African debt to junk status and Moody’s (as we discuss more fully below) are closely watching.\nSouth Africa is also in a delicate socio-economic position with rising social unrest, growing unemployment and it is recovering from state capture. Thus, drastic spend cuts or growth in SARS income are unrealistic. That leaves selling state assets as the most viable alternative to arresting the ongoing rise in our debt.\nIt is not just ratings agencies that have been anticipating the MTBPS but also business which could throw large resources into the economy if it sees that government is committed to turning around the slide of recent years.\nSo, how did the Finance Minister do?\nThe initial reaction to the MTBPS was one of disappointment, symbolized by the rand shedding 2.5% against the US dollar and bond yields dipping. It was not just that the Minister painted a picture of a sliding economy over the next three years but there were few specifics as to how the South African economy is going to get out of an increasingly nightmarish hole.\nFor example, Minister Mboweni was expected to provide some detail as to how Eskom’s debt (R450 billion) was going to be restructured but all he said was that Eskom must implement meaningful reforms before tackling its debt. In the Minister’s own words: “In addition to low growth, South Africa’s biggest economic risk is Eskom … Over the medium term and beyond, government will manage the massive risk to the economy and the fiscus associated with Eskom.”\nThe main indicators – bad news and good\n- GDP was forecast at 1.5% for 2019 in the February Budget, it is now forecast at 0.5% for this year, rising to 2.4% in 2023.\nThis is disappointing as population growth is 1.6%, so in reality GDP will grow by 0.8% in 2023 and be negative this year.\n- Inflation will remain benign throughout this period staying in the 5.3% average.\nAs inflation hits the poor the hardest, this is good news.\n- Debt/GDP which is a key ratio for ratings agencies will progressively deteriorate, a function of low economic growth and rising costs. This is 56.8% for the current year and increasing to nearly 69% in 2023. This is before support to State-Owned Enterprises (SOE) like Eskom and South African Airways.\nIf we look back a few years, government were saying that Debt/GDP would peak at around 50%. We have gone through that and are now looking at 70% and beyond. The nation is in danger of falling into a debt trap – rather like the consumer who, unable to borrow more money, finally maxes out his credit cards and spends most of his time paying off debt.\nSo, what does that mean for us?\nThe Finance Minister showed a bleak scene and clearly the government is struggling to get consensus as to how to address what is becoming a very serious problem. The Minister highlighted that in the next three years R150 billion has to be found either in tax increases or spending cuts. In the February budget, he will give the nation concrete measures to be taken.\nFor the man in the street expect more tax increases in the February budget.\nMoody’s and our junk status risk\nOn 1 November, Moody’s changed its outlook on South Africa from stable to negative. In a blunt statement, it gave the government notice that unless it comes up with “a credible fiscal strategy to contain the rise in debt” in the budget in February, Moody’s will most likely downgrade South Africa to junk status. That will trigger overseas financial institutions selling an estimated US$15 billion of South African bonds.\nThat would, of course, hurt us all and leave our nation, as Shakespeare put it, “bound in shallows and in miseries”. Let’s hope we dodge that one – on average it takes a country five to six years of hard slog to get out of junk status.", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}

Results from a new study by investigators at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) indicate that PGAD can be caused by altered firing of nerves that carry sensations from the genitalia or by damage to the lowest parts of the spinal cord. The study also found that neurological treatments benefit many patients.\n\"It's important that people know of this medical condition and that it is primarily a neurological problem, not a psychiatric one,\" said senior author Bruce Price, MD, an MGH Department of Neurology investigator who is also chief of Neurology at McLean Hospital. \"Many affected women are silent and undercover--it's in no way a fun condition, and it is difficult for patients to address their symptoms with their doctors, who have typically never heard of PGAD.\" The problem can be especially troubling for adolescents, causing confusion, shame, and fear.\nThe study, published in PAIN Reports, included 10 females whose PGAD symptoms began between ages 11 to 70 years. Although the study involved only a small number of patients, it's still one of the first to carefully examine PGAD in a thorough and scientific manner.\nSpinal nerve-root cysts were detected in four patients and generalized sensory nerve damage (neuropathy) in two. One patient with symptoms since childhood was born with a small defect in her lowest spinal cord, one had a lumbosacral herniated disc in the lower back, and another developed short-lived PGAD when she abruptly stopped a prescribed antidepressant medication.\nAll psychiatric and gynecological treatments were ineffective, and injecting local anesthetics had no lasting benefit. In contrast, neurological treatments--such as cyst removal and treating nerve damage--were effective in 80% of patients.\n\"Physicians need to be aware of PGAD and inquire about it when patients experience other pelvic pain or urological symptoms that often accompany PGAD,\" said first author Anne Louise Oaklander, MD, PhD, an investigator in the Department of Neurology at MGH. \"It's treatable, but the treatment depends on the cause. By identifying some common causes--and localizing them to specific regions of the sacral nervous system--our study provides direction on how to help patients and to guide future research.\"\nAbout the Massachusetts General Hospital\nMassachusetts General Hospital, founded in 1811, is the original and largest teaching hospital of Harvard Medical School.

{"id": "3185", "text": "Interested in pursuing a career in ministry? Going to seminary may be a necessary step in preparing for your future. There are thousands of seminary colleges all throughout the country, many of which are qualified and credible with expert curriculum. So how do you begin to choose the best seminary program for you?\nGrand Canyon Theological Seminary can help to develop and further your understanding of God, as well as prepare you to become a Christian leader. If you are wondering what to expect when attending seminary at GCU, continue reading.\nGrow in Biblical Knowledge\nSeminary programs offer students an in-depth study of God’s Word, allowing them to grow in their understanding of complex theological dilemmas. Grand Canyon Theological Seminary has incredible resources and professors who are committed to working alongside students and guiding them as they grow in their biblical knowledge. As important as it is to seek guidance and wisdom from the teachers and professionals at GCU, it is even more important to seek wisdom from God.\nEphesians 1:17, says “I keep asking that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the glorious Father, may give you the Spirit of wisdom and revelation, so that you may know him better.” This verse is a wonderful reminder of the true mission of every Christian in our personal, and for some, professional, pursuit to know our Savior more intimately.\nBecome Part of a Community\nDue to the nature of the classes and the time spent together, students in GCU’s seminary program benefit from a unique and close-knit community. Dean of GCU’s College of Theology Jason Hiles, PhD, describes Grand Canyon Theological Seminary as a covenant community, which is a group of people that are united in their love for Christ and their shared mission to further His kingdom in word and in deed.\nThis is a serious commitment, and it requires support and encouragement from students and faculty. GCU is proud to offer a seminary program that provides students with the resources to strengthen their understanding of theology, while also becoming part of a nurturing and supportive community.\nInvest in a Local Church\nThere is no better way to learn and understand applied theology in today’s church than to experience it firsthand. We are reminded of the dynamics and purpose of the church in Colossians 3:16 when Paul wrote, “Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly, teaching and admonishing one another in all wisdom, singing psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, with thankfulness in your hearts to God.”\nThe church is a beautiful demonstration of the community for which God created us. In addition, it presents a great opportunity to practice the roles and responsibilities that seminary will introduce. GCU’s seminary program works to prepare students to have the theological background, compassionate heart and the understanding of God to disciple the people of the church.\nGrand Canyon University’s College of Theology supports the university’s commitment to educating students from a Christian perspective.

It was great to share our fears, our satisfaction, our weakness and our strength. The conclusion was encouraging.\n“And the child grew and become strong in spirit, filled with wisdom; and the grace of God was upon Him”. Luke 2.40 KJV\nThere is nothing more a teacher likes to see than the growth of his students with wisdom under the Grace of the Lord. Here at Grace we see the kids growing and it rejoices us more than anything. When we look at the kids we clearly see the difference in many ways between when they came in this school and now. We know the Lord has done things in their lives during this school year and we look forward to see further growth in their lives in the coming years.\nThis month was full of activities because the government squished the different pedagogical evaluation in the months of May as March and April were seriously disturbed by the continuous strike. So the second term was in late April and the third in May. Please thank God for the third term those passed well, and pray for the DEF Exam (9th graders national exam) that starts on the 5th of Jun.\nWe had the privilege to visit many students’ families and it was amazing to hear firsthand the appreciation of parents. It brought us to believe that the school is well appreciated by all no matter which religion they practice. The frequent request from the parents was the kindergarten and the high School. We kept giving them hope about those requests to be fulfilled in very short future. This year we deplore the school abandon of two students including one boy who went to the artisanal gold mining field despite all the counseling of parents and teachers and a girl who prematurely got married and didn’t want to do nothing with school.\nThe deplorable attitude is that many parents force their kids to fast during this Ramadan. Those kids come with complains about belly pains, dizziness and many more, driving crazy Abel the school nurse to go tell the parents to stop forcing the little kids for fasting. Many believe it is a sin to cook in the family during this Ramadan period. If you do it, they believe you will bring curse in to the family.\nWe had one big rain but it is still not enough to stop the water crisis in the town.\nPlease pray that we get some more rain soon.\nThe school water pump failure was felt by the entire town of Koro before we get to replace by a new one. As soon as it was fixed the news went quickly and the line of donkey chart with colorful jugs was automatically there.\nFor the construction we are short in cement because of transportation issues and we hope we will get it very soon to resume with the work.\nWe acknowledge your support in this ministry, miracle is happening here because of your different supports. God bless you in return to all you do.\nAs I finish this newsletter I get a call from Bamako telling me that my lost backpack (with my new laptop, electric tooth brush, an amount of CFA cash, document for the school and some of the church plus cloths etc.) was found with everything inside. Praise the Lord with me for that. He answers all our prayers all the time.\nYour friend Ibrahima.", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

{"id": "3280", "text": "It is no secret that Israel’s first Prime Minister, David Ben Gurion, led a secular life. But what many may not realize is his knowledge of, and respect for, Torah.\nBen-Gurion was asked to write the introduction to the book Sefer Hebron (The Book of Hebron) by Oded Avisar (1970), and this is what he wrote:\nThree cities hold a great and unique place in the ancient history of our people: Shechem, Hebron and Jerusalem. In the Book of Genesis (Bereshit) we are told that Terach took his son Abram, his nephew Lot and his daughter-in-law Sarai, Abram’s wife and left Ur Kasdim bound for Canaan. On route they reached Haran and dwelt there. Terach died in Haran.\nThen the Almighty said to Abram: “Go forth from your land, from your birth place and from your father’s house to the land that I shall show you… and Abram went forth as he had been told by the Eternal… and he took with him Sarai his wife, Lot his nephew, all their possessions and the souls that they had acquired in Haran… and they came to the Land of Canaan. And Abram passed through the land until the place Shechem… and the Eternal appeared to Abram and said, “Unto your children shall I give this land.” There Abram built there an altar unto the Eternal who had appeared to him-and Abram continued his journey southward… and Abram made his camp and came and settled in the Plains of Mamre that are in Hebron and he built an alter to the Almighty.” (Genesis 12).\nHebrew history begins in Hebron. In Hebron… there arose the first Hebrew armed force, which battled with four great kings… because they had captured Abram’s nephew Lot and his property. When Abram heard this in Hebron, he immediately mobilized 318 of his followers and pursued the four kings up to Dan in the north, where he attacked at night and destroyed them, and rescued all the property and his nephew Lot, the women and the rest of the captives. This was the first war in Jewish history, which ended not merely with victory, but also with a demonstration of Abram’s breadth of spirit…\nWhen Sarah died in Hebron at the age of one hundred and twenty-seven, Abraham turned to the Hittites to grant him a burial plot. After prolonged and devious negotiations by the Hittites, Abraham paid four hundred silver shekels to Ephron for his field and all the trees surrounding its boundaries-and it became his. And when Abraham died 38 years later, he was buried by his sons Isaac and Ishmael in the cave which Abraham had bought from the Hittites.\nBefore Jacob died in Egypt, after going down there to see his son Joseph, he made his sons promise to bury him with his fathers “in Hebron in the cave, in Ephron the Hittite’s field, where were buried Abraham and his wife Sarah, Isaac and his wife Rebecca and where I buried Leah” (Genesis 49:29, 31). And that is what Joseph and his brothers did. It is thus clear that only the three Patriarchs and the three Matriarchs of the Jewish People were buried in the Cave of Machpela.\nHowever, the importance of Hebron is not merely its role in the lives of the Patriarchs and Matriarchs of our nation. After Saul, the first King of Israel fell upon his sword in the war with the Philistines, so that he might not be taken captive, and David replaced him as King, David inquired of the Eternal: “Shall I go up to one of the cities of Judah?” And the Eternal answered: Go up!” And David said: “Unto where shall I go up?” And G-d answered” “To Hebron.” And David went up there… and the men of Judah came and anointed David there as King of Judah” (Samuel II,2.4). Finally, after the death of Abner, commander of Saul’s army, “and all the tribes of Israel came to David in Hebron and proclaimed: “Behold we are of the bone and flesh; and so it was yesterday and the day before, while Saul was King over us, it was you who were the leader of Israel; and the Almighty has said “You shall shepherd my people Israel and you shall be prince of Israel.” And all the elders of Israel came to the king in Hebron, and King David made a covenant with them in Hebron over Israel” (Samuel II, 5:1-3). Thus arose in Hebron the greatest royal dynasty that Israel ever had.\nThe city of Jerusalem — which became in the course of time, from the crowning of David until our own days, not merely the most precious and Holy City in the Land of Israel, but one of the most revered cities in the world is not mentioned at all in the Five Books of the Torah. Further, after the reign of David who captured the city Jerusalem from the Jebusites and made it the eternal capital of Israel and his son, King Solomon, built the Beit HaMikdash (Temple) within her. After Solomon died the people of Israel came to crown his son Rechavam, not in Jerusalem, but in Shechem. And of the forty years of David’s reign, seven and a half he ruled in Hebron, while Jerusalem, though not mentioned at all in the Torah, was made by Israel’s greatest king into the city of holiness.\nHowever, don’t forget: the beginnings of Israel’s greatest king were in Hebron, the city to which came the first Hebrew about eight hundred years before King David, and we will make a great and awful mistake if we fail to settle Hebron, neighbor and predecessor of Jerusalem, with a large Jewish settlement, constantly growing and expanding, very soon. This will also be a blessing to the Arab neighbors. Hebron is worthy to be Jerusalem’s sister.\nDavid Ben Gurion\n18 Shvat 5730\n25 Jan. 1970\nThe fact that even a secular leader like Ben-Gurion still understood the religious significance of Hebron should help you understand better just what this land means to the Jewish people.", "scores": {"score": 3, "score_transform_1": 5, "score_transform_2": 5, "score_transform_3": 0}}
{"id": "3289", "text": "Brand new jewellery sparkles, especially under the bright lights at the jewellery store. But after a while, your earrings, bracelets and rings take on a worn look. Dust and dirt creep into the crevices of your favourite filigree ring. Silver earrings tarnish and show their age. Even diamonds, those light-filled gems, can appear cloudy and dim.\nIf this is the state of your jewellery, it’s cleaning time! With a little care and attention, you can restore your collection to its former glory and wear your jewellery with pride. You may even find that you love your rings and necklaces more than ever, now that you’ve seen them at their very best.\nRefer to our complete guide to cleaning jewellery whenever your collection loses its lustre. Let’s get started.\nGeneral Jewellery Care\nWe’ll talk about specific cleaning techniques for different kinds of jewellery in the next section. But first, let’s review a few tips for general jewellery care.\nDon’t allow jewellery pieces to rub against each other or hard surfaces.\nScratches plague fine jewellery, but you can minimise the risk of scratches by storing it in small, padded boxes or soft pouches. When you’re wearing your jewellery, avoid using heavy tools or engaging in activities that could result in scrapes and scratches. For instance, you’ll want to leave your rings at home if you’re planning to spend the day building sandcastles at the beach. You can always wrap jewellery in tissues and place them in a sealable freezer or lunch bag.\nAvoid exposure to harsh chemicals.\nThe chemicals in household cleaners, sunscreen, nail polish remover and pool chemicals can react with precious metals and gemstones, altering their appearance and affecting their sheen. If you can’t remove your ring for cleaning, wear protective gloves to prevent exposure to the chemicals.\nBe cautious about jewellery and water.\nNot only can jewellery pieces clatter down drains or get lost in the sea, but they can suffer damage from everyday activities like showering. Soap residue from shampoo and body wash can coat jewellery, which makes it susceptible to attracting dust and dirt particles.\nCaring for Gold Jewellery\nNow that we know the general guidelines for caring for jewellery let’s look at specific instructions for gold.\nSince pure gold is too soft for jewellery making, your pieces will be made of an alloy containing gold and other metals. If the gold is 14k or above, it shouldn’t tarnish or discolour with regular wear. If you’ve noticed a colour change, wash the gold piece with mild soap, water and a soft brush. Rinse it thoroughly, and shine it up with a soft, clean cloth.\nIf a good cleaning doesn’t bring it back to its original sheen, you should question whether your jewellery is made of gold. If it takes on a greenish tint, it may be brass or contain a higher content of other metals than you suspected.The green is caused by an acidic reaction to copper or silver in the metal.\nCaring for Silver Jewellery\nAll precious metals can tarnish to some degree, but sterling silver tarnishes quickly. Left to itself over time, sterling silver turns brown, grey or black. Sterling silver tarnishes more easily than pure silver because it has been alloyed with copper. What can you do to prevent tarnish?\nOne of the most natural strategies for preventing tarnish is to wear your silver jewellery regularly. As the metal moves against your skin, it stays clean and bright. You can also prevent tarnish by avoiding humidity, when possible. For example, don’t leave your silver earrings in a steamy bathroom. Instead, tuck them away in a jewellery box in a dryer location. If you live in a humid climate, consider placing your jewellery storage near a humidity absorber.\nCaring for Gemstones\nClean gemstones using water, a neutral, mild detergent and a soft brush. Jewellery that features hard gemstones like diamonds, rubies and sapphires are generally safe for use in ultrasonic cleaners.\nAvoid using an ultrasonic cleaner for pieces that contain pearls, turquoise, opal, lapis lazulis and other soft gemstones. These fragile gemstones require careful handling and shouldn’t be worn when they could be in contact with household cleaners, shampoo, perfume and other chemical-containing substances.\nInsure Your Jewellery\nWhile you can keep your jewellery clean and safe at home, it’s not always possible to protect it from theft and loss. That’s why we provide affordable jewellery insurance to our customers. To learn more about protecting your jewellery with JewelCover insurance, get in touch with us today.\nIf you wouldn’t be able to easily replace your favourite jewellery, insure it. Our full-value protection provides peace of mind.", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

And he did so by sharing experiences with revelation from his own life.\nLater he revealed (pun intended) how we can best receive that revelation in our lives.\nWe all have questions that can be answered and challenges that can be solved with the divine inspiration that comes from revelation. But do we have the power-packed combination President Nelson offered?\nPure and obedient\nIncreased purity and exact obedience go hand in hand. You can’t have one without the other. We increase our purity only by aligning ourselves more closely to standards of truth, and that means obeying the commandments with more exactness.\nI remember on my mission we were constantly encouraged to be “Ammon missionaries.” Ammon performed every command given him (Alma 18:10) and as a result had wonderful missionary opportunities open to him. Years later, many of the sons of the converts Ammon taught went to battle under Helaman’s command. Mormon ascribes their miraculous preservation in battle to their faith, which they had because “they did obey and observe to perform every word of command with exactness” (Alma 57:21).\nHow exact are we in our obedience? Are we unable to receive the revelation we need to do wonderful things because our tolerance for impurity is too low? Are we kept from our best life solely by the essential bits of information we might have received had we been more committed?\nSeeking and feasting\nJust as purity and obedience go hand in hand, so too do earnest seeking and feasting daily from the Book of Mormon. Earnest seekers of answers to questions and solutions to challenges will look to hear God’s voice through many channels. And an obvious channel is the scriptures.\nAnd in no book of scripture can we hear the voice of heaven more clearly than in the Book of Mormon. This book was prepared for us in our day. The ancient prophet Alma the Younger instructed his son Helaman that the Lord was preparing the plates from which the Book of Mormon was later translated “that he may show forth his power unto future generations” (Alma 37:14). I believe part of that “power” is an increased capacity to hear the voice of God provide answers to our questions and solutions to our challenges.\nOf course, we don’t always get answers and solutions just for the asking. Some times we’re left to struggle with our questions and challenges because that struggle will help us to grow in a way we other wouldn’t if we received everything on demand. But, as President Nelson promises,\nCertainly these blessings come after we do our part. So how are we doing? Are we earnestly seeking for answers while feasting every day in the Book of Mormon?\nCommitted to temple and family history work\nThe final part of President Nelson’s power-packed combination is like icing on a cake. Temples are natural places of revelation, and the family history work that supports temple work naturally invites revelation. Both provide ways for us to practice the increased receptivity to revelation gained from increased purity, exact obedience, earnest seeking, and daily feasting in the Book of Mormon.\nI confess that lately I’ve been slacking here. There’s no reason why I can’t attend the temple weekly. In fact, I’ve never before had so little excuse not to attend weekly as I live conveniently to two temples. But like most things in life, if you don’t schedule the time to go and then commit to follow that schedule, life can easily crowd out family history and temple service.\nThat’s why I like President Nelson’s description: “regular time committed.” We need to establish a time when we will go to the temple and when we will participate in some aspect of family history work. And then we need to commit ourselves to follow through on our plans.\nWhat questions do you need answered? What challenges do you need solved? Revelation can help. When we follow President Nelson’s counsel, that blessing can be ours. And that will bring us more joy in our journey.\nHowdy! I'm Lance, host of Joy in the Journey Radio. I've been blogging about LDS singles life since 2012, and since 2018 I've been producing a weekly Internet radio show and podcast to help LDS singles have more joy in their journey and bring all Latter-day Saints together.

When the capsules pop open the bright red seeds with a single black eye are a delight. The name the tree has been given is not so obvious and hopefully in years to come children will remember what the planting of the tree signified.\nThe story began when educators from the school heard about the Wessa/WWF Eco-School programme from David Letsoalo, a well known bird guide in the area, and how it had benefited rural, township and urban schools to integrate environment into lesson planning, helped to structure action projects and to manage resources wisely.\nEducators realised that their school could benefit. On registration the school identified the various environmental problems at their school such as trees had been removed for fire wood, littering was rife, the soil was highly leached and infertile and the food garden was not fenced and was consumed by goats.\nThe school also realised that they were on the environmentally friendly track as they are harvesting rainwater and are not entirely reliant on piped water. David has been helping this school to fulfil the requirements of becoming an Eco-School with funding from The Green Trust (a partnership between WWF and Nedbank). Their Eco-Report will be assessed in November by an independent panel who will decide whether their environmental footprint has been reduced.\nWhen David heard that he had been chosen to represent southern Africa on the Rotary International Professional Exchange Programme in May to June 2008 he decided to offset the carbon emissions that will be generated by flying to Canada and the USA by including the schools that he has worked with. Thirty trees were purchased and planted in five schools and at each school David had the chance to share his excitement with the youth from his own province of Limpopo.\nAs the Canada tree grows the learners of these five Eco-Schools will remember that one of their own took wings and soared beyond the everyday humdrum and will be encouraged to make their own dreams a reality.\nBy Cathy Dzerefos", "scores": {"score": 3, "score_transform_1": 5, "score_transform_2": 5, "score_transform_3": 0}}

{"id": "3346", "text": "If you’re planning on heading out this New Year’s Eve in Vegas, be careful. Metro Police are on high alert this season. 8 News Now has reported that deadly crashes are up 30%, hit and run deaths are double, the total number of traffic collisions is 14% higher, fatal crashes involving drugged drivers are up 150%, and Las Vegas DUI arrests are up 9.7%, compared to last year’s numbers. All these figures point to greater numbers of patrols being out this year, waiting to arrest anyone who breaks the law. Whether you are a tourist or a native Nevada resident, you should be aware of the risks of celebrating New Year’s Eve in Las Vegas.\nWhat to Know When Visiting Vegas for the New Year\nWhatever you plan on doing this New Year’s weekend, you can be sure that Las Vegas Metropolitan Police (LVMPD) will be out in full force, enforcing all of the various state and local laws. Below I have prepared some information for you about how to make this New Year’s celebration unforgettable – but only in good ways.\nWhere to Party in Las Vegas?\nIf you don’t have plans for New Year’s Eve yet, the Strip is the best place to go to ring in the New Year. This unforgettable experience is like a giant block party. You can check out some of this year’s biggest shows, parties, and venues here. You’ll want to plan ahead since the Las Vegas Metro Police shut down the Strip between Sahara Avenue and Russell Road to cross-traffic as early as 4 p.m. You can try alternative routes such as the Desert Inn super-arterial for east-west travel or Frank Sinatra Drive to the west or Koval Lane to the east for north-south travel.\nThe Las Vegas Metro Police Department often increases the number of DUI checkpoints around the city during the New Year’s celebration. You can check for current checkpoints on the Metro’s Twitter page.\nCasino Debts/Markers Don’t Stay in Vegas\nDespite the popular adage, not all things stay in Vegas, including casino debt or markers. If you don’t quickly pay back casino markers, you can find yourself facing fraud charges.\nIt’s a common misconception that prostitution is legal in Las Vegas. It’s not. It’s also not legal anywhere in Clark County. Be on the lookout for undercover LVMPD officers trying to entrap you.\nThe last thing you want is to be charged with DUI on New Year’s Eve in Las Vegas. RTC, the local bus system, is providing free rides to help out this holiday. The company will be servicing 39 fixed routes from 6 p.m. to 9 a.m. The Las Vegas monorail is also available. If you want some privacy, you can take advantage of the many other alternative transportation options available in Vegas, including Uber, Lyft, taxis, or limos.\nThe LVMPD keeps a list of items you are not allowed to use on New Year’s Eve at certain times and locations, which include:\n- Purses or bags larger than 12 inches by 6 inches by 12 inches\n- Fanny packs\n- Cinch bags\n- Computer bags\n- Camera bags\n- Strollers, carts, or vehicles propelled by electricity, mechanical means, or humans unless they are immediately medically necessary\nWhat Constitutes DUI While Visiting Las Vegas?\nUnder NRS 484C.110, it is considered a DUI to drive a vehicle while impaired by alcohol, drugs, or a combination of these substances. This includes driving a vehicle with a concentration of alcohol of 0.08 percent or more in your blood or breath or consuming these substances to a degree that renders you incapable of safely driving or exercising actual physical control of a vehicle.\nWhat Should I Do If I’m Arrested?\nIf you are charged with DUI while visiting Las Vegas or are arrested for another crime, contact an experienced criminal defense lawyer and follow the other steps I have outlined for you. I want you to stay safe this holiday season, but I’ll be there for me if you need me.", "scores": {"score": 0, "score_transform_1": 0, "score_transform_2": 0, "score_transform_3": 1}}

This is used to settle international transactions. However, unlike xRapid, xCurrent doesn’t use XRP to process cross-border transactions. Instead, it relies on Ripple’s blockchain to achieve this.\nOn Monday, Ripple explained that xRapid and the use of XRP would act as a “bridge” between currencies. Ultimately, this would enable payment providers and banks to conduct quicker transactions. Those testing the xRapid product include MoneyGram, Western Union, and payment startups MercuryFX, Viamericas, and Cuallix.\nSo far, no banks have been announced that are testing the product. Yet, earlier this year, Brad Garlinghouse, CEO of Ripple, said:\nI’ve publicly stated that by the end of  I have every confidence that major banks will use xRapid as a liquidity tool.\nAt the time of writing, XRP is trading at $0.480953, according to CoinMarketCap. This is up by 40.20 percent in 24 hours. Over seven days, it has increased by 72.52 percent.\nWill XRP Replace Ethereum in Second Place?\nAt its highest, XRP was valued at $3.54 at the beginning of January. However, just as with the rest of the market, its price has dropped.\nYet, this recent rally on the back on Ripple’s news has seen it move from $0.27 at the start of the week to $0.33 on the 19th. It remains to be seen how much further it will rise and whether it will increase back to previous highs. The last time it saw any significant height, after January, was in April when it was around the $0.90 mark.\nSomething to note as well is that the overall market value of XRP is creeping closer to that of Ethereum. XRP is currently valued at $19.1 billion; Ethereum is at $23.1 billion. Will it soon replace Ethereum in second place?\nDo you think XRP’s value will continue to rise?

We know that you have questions and concerns after suffering injuries due to a crash or accident that was not your fault, and we want to share some of the most commonly asked questions that we have answered for our clients during our first meetings.\nShould I talk to my company’s insurance representatives before talking to an attorney?\nIt is vital to consider that when you talk to your insurance company after an accident, their representatives will do everything to decrease your settlement. They may even try to blame you for the accident. We suggest talking to an attorney first about your accident to learn your rights and what your compensation should include. A lawyer can also negotiate a settlement on your behalf.\nHow can I afford the medical care I need after my accident while not working?\nIf you have insurance, workers’ comp, Medicaid or Medicare, such institutions should pay for your treatment. If you don’t have insurance, you may request a bank loan to pay your bills or ask for a hold on your medical bills if health services allow you to do so. Depending on the circumstances of your accident, you may even apply for lawsuit financing. This loan will enable you to cover your expenses while you have an ongoing suit before the party at fault compensates you for your accident. Please consult with the attorneys at Loney & Schueller, LLC to determine how this may financially impact your case\nWhatever the circumstances, a skilled personal injury attorney can help you explore your options and ensure you get the compensation you deserve. We also recommend talking to a lawyer if you were severely injured and might require longer to recover or costly resources to live life as normally as possible.\nAfter my accident, when should I seek medical care?\nYou should seek medical assistance right after your accident, preferably. Adrenaline may hide the symptoms of severe injuries that could even put your life at risk. Therefore, it is essential to seek medical care and document your injuries. Information about your medical follow-up may become evidence to back up your insurance claim or lawsuit against the negligent party who caused your accident.\nI’m not sure if I have a case. What can I do?\nA good starting point is to discuss your case with a knowledgeable personal injury lawyer. Based on your accident’s unique circumstances and facts, an attorney can help you determine if you have a case. Drawing from their experience, they will also explain your options and what you can expect if you decide to file a lawsuit.\nHow will I pay a personal injury attorney if I can barely pay my current expenses?\nPersonal injury attorneys like us work on a contingency basis, which means that you pay our fees when we recover your compensation. You can rest assured that we will fight tirelessly to cover your needs and will not settle for less.\nIf You Have Been Injured In An Iowa Motor Vehicle Accident, Call An Experienced Lawyer At Loney & Schueller\nDon’t let the insurance company add insult to your injury – put Loney & Schueller on your side.

In the majority of the illnesses, individuals reportedly ate at a Taco Bell restaurant within seven days before onset of the illness. Other causes of illness are also under investigation.

The government has said that an open bin of white onions tested positive for the bacteria, but representatives indicated that it is a completely different strain and had no relation to this E. coli outbreak.\nCDC is conducting an ongoing \"case control\" study that involves interviewing ill and well restaurant patrons about what food items they consumed, raw ingredients in particular. By comparing foods consumed by ill and well persons, investigators hope to show statistical links to particular food ingredients. The CDC has concluded that green onions, which Taco Bell voluntary removed from its restaurants following a preliminary investigation, are probably not linked to the outbreak.\n\"Based on this testing and all that we know today, I can reassure you that all Taco Bell food is safe and strict standards are being upheld at all of our restaurants. The majority of the restaurants that we voluntarily closed have been re-opened,” said Creed. “We will continue to work with the FDA, CDC and local, state and federal health authorities in their ongoing investigation to get to the root cause of this issue.”\nTaco Bell serves more than 35 million consumers each week in nearly 5,800 restaurants across the United States.", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}
{"id": "3407", "text": "To look at what risks will affect the supply chain in 2018, Rob Savitsky of AIR Worldwide ( a member of the MIT Center for Transportation & Logistics Supply Chain Exchange program), wrote a blog for MIT discussing three broad categories of supply chain risk.\n1. Natural Catastrophes\nIn 2017 losses incurred from catastrophes such as hurricanes, wildfires, and earthquakes could make it one of the costliest years in history for the property insurance industry, Savitsky noted.\n“These events also caused supply chain disruptions — although not all the effects may have been fully realized yet,” he said. For example, an analysis carried out by AIR on the potential impact of Hurricane Harvey on regional manufacturing found that, based on percentage of the total potential revenue loss, the top three subsectors are petroleum and coal products manufacturing (37%), chemical manufacturing (13%), and oil and gas extraction (12%).\nHurricane Maria, which slammed into Puerto Rico on September 20, 2017, is a prime example of a catastrophe that reverberates through supply chains. It’s been reported, for example, that the destruction of medical device manufacturing capacity in Puerto Rico wrought by the hurricane has led to a national shortage of medical IVs, which has forced some hospitals to use alternative products and find new suppliers.\nMan-made events such as fire, product defects, cyber-attacks, labor and civil unrest, terrorism, utility failure, and piracy, are more frequent disruptors of supply chains but typically have a lower severity than natural catastrophes.\nIn 2016 several man-made disruptions affected the supply chain. He points to the late summer Gap warehouse fire in Fishkill, New York, which destroyed 30% of Gap’s total warehouse space and disrupted more than 10% of Gap’s orders. Another example is the Samsung Note cellphone battery recall, which was linked to problems in a battery supplier’s supply chain and had far-reaching consequences for the Samsung brand and their customers.\nThe past few years have seen an increasing prevalence of cyber-attacks. Most of these incidents, such as the high-profile Equifax data breach that involved the personal information of some 143 million Americans do not directly affect supply chains. However, they raise major red flags for supply chain practitioners.\nEconomic situation can cause product or labor shortages. Examples include sub-suppliers that perform poorly, financial insolvency, and trade or tariff. For example the The 2016 Hanjin maritime carrier bankruptcy left workers, ships, containers, and product stranded at sea and in ports around the world.\nSavitsky points to the example of a potential disruption that was averted. The 105-year-old, Massachusetts-based supplier Cutler-McDermott Co., that produced auto parts for GM and filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2016. The company’s insolvency threatened 19 of GM’s North American production facilities, and if not for a settlement of $2.9 million, could have cost GM “tens of millions of dollars” in losses.\nGiven all of these possibilities, preparing proactively might be the best strategy for minimizing risks. Savitsky gives the example of the 2011 Tohoku earthquake, where Toyota learned from the event and responded by building information networks covering about 4000 auto parts. When the 2016 Kumamoto earthquake occurred, Toyota was better prepared and able to identify which suppliers had been affected in a matter of hours, and then quickly shift parts production to alternative suppliers.", "scores": {"score": 3, "score_transform_1": 5, "score_transform_2": 5, "score_transform_3": 0}}

Disability Determination Services will do another complete review of your claim by someone who did not take part in the first decision. SSA will look at all the evidence submitted when the original decision was made, plus any new evidence. The reconsideration process can take several months.\nTo have your case reconsidered, you must complete and return the proper Social Security forms. You have 60 days from the letter of denial date to file for reconsideration. If you wait more than 60 days, you will likely have to start the benefits application process all over again.\nIf your claim is denied again under reconsideration (as almost 90% of them are), you may request a hearing. Again, you will have 60 days to file this appeal. The hearing will be conducted by an Administrative Law Judge who had no part in the original decision or the reconsideration of your case. This is the best opportunity to present your case, because you get to tell your story in person.\nDo not delay in filing a request for a hearing. If you miss the deadline, you will likely be required to file a new application. Generally, this is a waste of your time, because you will be forced to go through the whole time consuming process again, and you could lose out on a substantial amount of benefits. In addition, depending on your work history, if you miss the deadline to appeal, you may be barred forever from filing another disability claim.\nAt NDL, we often hear potential clients tell us that they did not appeal on time because they did not have all of their medical records. You do not need to have all of your medical records in order to file an appeal. It is best to appeal first to protect the date, as you will have another opportunity to submit evidence after the appeal is filed.\nOur best advice is to consult with an experienced local disability law firm which can help evaluate your case and fight for your rights in the appeals process. A 2017 Government Accounting Office (GAO) study found that if a Social Security disability claimant had a representative, they were three times more likely to be allowed benefits than someone who had no representation at all.\nSo the bottom line is this: if your disability claim is denied, file an appeal and get proof as soon as possible, or contact a Chicago Social Security law firm such as Nash Disability Law to file an appeal.

{"id": "3472", "text": "Razer Core Benchmarks, Analysis, and Compatibility: Is it Worth it?\nWe finally had the chance to review the eGPU dock Razer Core. External GPU solutions for notebooks are not a new invention by any means (also see our review from 2014), but Razer is one of the first big manufacturers with a corresponding solution based on the powerful Thunderbolt 3 (TB3) interface. Although it was initially very difficult to get a hold of due to limited stock, the Razer Core is now relatively easy to procure (if you're willing to pay the price for one).\nIf you purchase the Razer Core in a bundle with the Razer Blade Stealth notebook (the promoted bundle), you can get the Core for 449.99 Euros right now. The price is higher at 599.99 Euros when you only get the Core. For comparison, Asus' XG Station 2 is currently available for a street price of around 500 Euros. Other competing (and cheaper) eGPU solutions include the Mantiz Venus, AKiTiO Node, and PowerColor Devil Box. These eGPU enclosures utilize the newer TI3 controller, however, which seems to exhibit some performance-related bugs (you can read more about that here).\n- 500 Watt internal power supply (maximum of 375 Watts available for GPU)\n- Supports double-wide, full-length, PCI-Express x16 GPUs\n- Measures 4.13” / 104.9 mm (Width) x 13.38” / 339.9 mm (Depth) x 8.6” / 218.4 mm (Height)\n- Supports GPUs up to 12.20” x 5.98” x 1.73” (310 x 152 x 44 mm)\n- 1x TB3 (for connecting to host), 4 x USB 3.0, 1 x Gigabit Ethernet\nCase and Ports\nRazer does not make any compromises in terms of chassis materials and design, which is the case for the Razer Blade (here in review) as well as the Razer Core. The case is made of solid aluminum with a metal mesh \"window\" to display the GPU and increase air flow. There are no parts of the case that feel weak or compromised, which leads to a feel of robust quality. In terms of aesthetics, the Core does not look playful or cheesy, despite the aggressive industrial design and lighting options. The matte black case is a perfect match for the notebooks from Razer, but also pairs well with almost any other notebook on one's desk.\nThe Core has a number of fan exhausts: Fresh air is sucked in at the top, a grill at the sides (for the GPU), an opening at the bottom (for the fan and the integrated power adapter) and an additional opening in the area of the ports at the back. The case itself has three fans to cool the power adapter and other electronic components as well as a fan measuring 40 x 20mm which circulates the air inside the case. All of these are in addition to the fans from the installed GPU. The fan for the PSU in particular is extremely loud, and so the Core makes quite a bit of noise when activated, even when not under gaming load. Quieter fans would have been very much appreciated.\nThe Core does have ports (though it lacks TB3 pass-through or USB 3.1 Type-C). There are four USB 3.0 Type-A ports and one 10/100/1000 Ethernet port in the back. Unfortunately, we had issues with USB devices disconnecting during use, and it seems that we are not the only ones with the issue. At the moment, it appears to be a hardware issue that can only be fixed by a replacement — but there is no guarantee the replacement will not be defective as well, as this seems to affect many users still.\nAll ports of the Core are located at the back, where you also find the release to open the case. Razer unfortunately includes a very short Thunderbolt cable with a length of just 0.5 meters, so it cannot be routed around the notebook. This means the user must look at the less aesthetically pleasing side with the ports or else position it directly behind the laptop (rather than beside it). Luckily, other companies, such as StarTech, offer 1-meter 40Gbps TB3 cables. They are quite expensive, however.\nIn theory, the Razer Core should be compatible with any computer with a TB3 port. We say \"in theory\" because in practice, a manufacturer, such as HP with their Spectre 13, can elect to specifically disable the ability. To date, however, we believe that HP's Spectre 13 is the only example of this.\nNot all laptops work as seamlessly as others, however. Razer promises that their notebooks will have plug-and-play functionality with the Core, but the same cannot be said for other laptops such as the XPS 15 or 13, which are a bit more buggy and require a bit of driver tinkering to get working right. Thus, while you can buy a Razer Core (or other eGPU) for your TB3-equipped notebook, you should be aware that the performance and reliability of the connection are not guaranteed. In general, however, the newer the laptop is, the more seamless the functionality will be.\nSome popular laptops that have been tested to work with the Razer Core (and other eGPUs) include:\n- Alienware 13 R3\n- Alienware 15 R4\n- Alienware 17 R4\n- Asus Transformer 3 Pro\n- MacBook Pro 13\n- MacBook Pro 15\n- MSI GS43VR\n- MSI GS63VR\n- Spectre x360 13\"\n- Spectre x360 15\"\n- Thinkpad T470\n- XPS 13 2-in-1 9365\n- XPS 15 9550 (half-speed)\n- XPS 15 9560 (half-speed)\n- XPS 13 9350 (half-speed)\n- XPS 13 9360 (half-speed)\nInstallation and Setup\nThe first step is the installation of the desktop graphics card, which could not be easier: Pull the lever, pull out the tray, insert desktop GPU, secure the thumb-screw, attach power cable, push the whole unit back into the case, secure the lever, done – no tools required. As a result, even frequent switching of the GPU (required when we did in our benchmark tests) is easy and convenient. We noticed two issues with the tray, however: Firstly, the power cable for the GPU touches the case when you pull the GPU tray out. This does not sound good and should also not be an issue for such an expensive device. It also means that while a card may officially fit the dimensional requirements of the core, the power cable may make it impossible to fix. Secondly, there is only one hole to secure a dual-slot GPU via screw, so a single-slot GPU would not be properly secured inside the case.\nIt is also easy to attach the dock to the Blade. Power the Core and attach an external monitor, then attach Core and laptop – Razer Blade via Thunderbolt cable in our case – and start the laptop. The Core then starts automatically.\nThe standard Fire Strike benchmark makes it clear that there is potentially an extremely significant 30-40% performance difference between desktops and the Razer Blade/Core solution, which is more pronounced at higher framerates (due to bandwidth limitations) and less pronounced at lower framerates (as the TB3 cable doesn't have to shuttle as much data). There is a fairly proportional increase (or decrease) when moving through Nvidia's Pascal line of GPUs. For benchmarks, the greatest price/performance increase is seen pairing the Blade (i7-7700HQ) with the GTX 1070.\nLittle difference is seen in the physics scores, as these are nearly entirely reliant on the CPU. The desktop scores used for comparison are compiled averages of desktop systems with that card.\nFire Strike Extreme\nThe more taxing Fire Strike Extreme test shows scores closer to the typical desktop score. A typical GTX 1080 descktop scores around 9500, while a desktop with 1070 would generally score around 8000. There is still a roughly 15% disparity between the desktop and eGPU systems, however. The reason for this is that as the GPU works harder and delivers fewer frames during more taxing benchmarks, the limited bandwidth (in comparison to a direct PCI Express x16 connection) becomes less of a problem.\nThe advantages attributed to using the Core with a laptop become a bit more blurred when we look at game benchmarks. There are a number of factors at play here, including engine optimization, CPU or GPU dependence, and the limitations of the TB3 protocol.\nBased on the aforementioned limitations of TB3, we expect to see that games will exhibit less performance loss with the Core on higher detail levels (where the card puts out fewer FPS) and more performance loss on lower detail levels (where the card puts out many more FPS). Using the internal monitor of the laptop is also expected to decrease performance by around 10-15% in comparison to a monitor attached directly to the core (this is again due to bandwidth limitations as the TB3 will have to route the data back to the attached PC).\nDeus Ex: Human Revolution\nBenchmarks for Deus Ex: Human Revolution show that cards in the Core perform well below the desktop system average for each card (where data is available). As expected, this difference is more pronounced at lower detail and less pronounced at higher details. Surprisingly, we can see that the Razer Blade's own 1060 outperforms a 1070 in the core at high and low details. At ultra, the GTX 1070 (in Core) is only 3 FPS faster than the Razer Blade's 1060. Some card benchmarks were unavailable at 4K.\nRise of the Tomb Raider\nRise of the Tomb Raider shows less of a difference between framerates at different details levels. The fact that there is very little difference between the Blade's own GTX 1060 and the core with the 1070, 1080, and 1080 Ti while desktops with those same cards see significant differences between cards suggests a bottleneck with TB3 or the CPU in the Blade.\nMass Effect: Andromeda\nThe limitations of the Core (and Blade) are again highly apparent in Mass Effect: Andromeda. The Blade's internal 1060 handily outperforms the 1070 in the Core and achieves similar performance to the Core with 1080 Ti and 1080. In comparison, the desktop system averages show nearly double the framerates of the Blade and Core.\nThe Witcher 3: Wild Hunt\nStill one of the most graphically intensive games around two years after launch, the Witcher 3 is usually an opportunity for GPUs to show their capabilities. Our benchmarks show similar performance across all cards with the Blade and Core. While desktop averages were not available for high and low settings, we can see that the desktop average again is nearly double that of our setup's.\nFor Honor's benchmarks show some anomalous results that may be attributable to the game either being CPU bound or not well optimized. The extreme difference between the 1080 Ti on internal display vs external display suggests bandwidth limitations.\nSynthetic benchmarks alone don't tell the whole story: While it initially appeared that the GTX 1070 was the sweet spot in the price-to-performance ratio, the gaming benchmarks frequently showed the Blade's internal GTX 1060 achieving parity with — or outperforming — the GTX 1070. This at least suggests that owners of a laptop with a dedicated GPU and TB3 should not shell out for a Core and card without first considering their usage scenarios. Unless they are playing at very high resolutions that require the hardware capabilities of a 1070 or 1080, the performance increase seen with this generation of cards and the Core is minimal (or even worse) when compared to an integrated GTX 1060. This generalization would be doubly true for any laptop with a GTX 1070 or better, as nearly any current card attached to it in the core would perform worse than the laptop on its own.\nOf course, if a laptop has a less capable GPU than the 1060 (or no GPU at all), then it would certainly be a better value proposition to buy a GPU and external graphics enclosure — just don't expect to achieve the same results of a desktop system.\nThe Razer Core was the first TB3-based external GPU enclosure to be made available for consumers, and the company deserves acclaim for being the first out of the gate with a disruptive, premium product that fits a definite niche. However, the Core is far from a perfect solution: Its high cost — even compared to other eGPU enclosures — means that you're looking at spending between 500-800 Euro for the Core plus a GPU. Whether or not this price is worth it is a mostly a matter of whether your laptop has a GPU such as a GTX 1060 (or better) already. In real world performance (not synthetic benchmarks), there seems to be little benefit to using even a 1080 in a Core over an integrated 1060, and in some situations the integrated card actually performs better. This is not the result you want to see when you've paid 900 Euro for the Core and a decent GPU, not to mention the money you've already spent on the laptop. It goes without saying that you could build a higher performing desktop for the price, but this ignores the true function of the Core: to augment an existing laptop.\nAll in all, the Core does what it says it does: it allows the user to attach an external graphics card to a computer with a TB3 port. However, the limitations of TB3 and the device need to be kept in mind to avoid unrealistic expectations of parity with desktop-gaming setups. It will get you close enough, though — for a price.\nIf you have a laptop with a weaker graphics card, such as a GTX 1050, Radeon Pro 460, or iGPU, then the Core plus a card like the GTX 1070 will certainly give you an enormous increase in graphical power — at a high cost. It is up to the consumer if the high additional cost of an eGPU is worth the convenience of having only one machine.\nIn addition to the legitimate concerns of price and performance, the fact that a major feature of the Core — its USB hub — seems to still be defective 12 months after release in a number of units is disappointing, and it certainly detracts from the usefulness of the Core as an all-purpose docking solution.\nFinally, the half-meter TB3 cable that the Razer Core comes with is not sufficient for nearly any kind of setup you would imagine. As it attaches to the back of the core, you will be staring at the unattractive business-end of the device during use unless you shell out another chunk of change for a third party 1m cable. For a high-priced premium system, this literal shortcoming is glaring.", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

{"id": "3548", "text": "***Update: I’ve been using the Hidrate Spark 2.0 for a month now, and whoa, have I seen some amazing results. I am feeling more energized and ready to take on the summer festivities. Even though I am a summer baby, summer is my least favorite season…I can’t stand the heat. I end up feeling tired and lethargic, and I know that being dehydrated is partly the blame for that. Since using the Hidrate Spark 2.0, I’m feeling more energized and ready to take on the summer fun! And my skin!? I don’t think I’ve ever seen it so clear! Drinking water and staying hydrated is the best moisturizer there is! Lastly, I’m trimming down! I’m really trying to steer clear of sodas and sugary drinks. Except for a cup a tea that I may have now and then, water is pretty much all I’ve been drinking. I can definitely see how getting rid of those calories have helped me to slim down just a bit. However, what’s most important, is that I am starting to feel more healthy! For me, it’s not about size, but how I’m feeling. And thanks to the Hidrate Spark 2.0, I’m feeling pretty good! Keep reading below for more on this amazing water bottle!\nHey guys! How are you doing? I have so much going on that I can’t wait to share with you! A lot of exciting and life changing things happening. Starting with what I am about to show you now. On The Pink Caboodle, I talk a lot about body positivity and self-esteem. My only goal is to help encourage and uplift you guys, just as you would do for me.\nWell, part of being confident, and loving our bodies, is being proactive in taking care of our health. That’s where things start to get a little tricky. I think one of the greatest misconceptions when we hear the word “healthy’, is that you have to be skinny to be healthy — the perfect size. But we all know, that the only perfect size, is the size that’s perfect for you!\nBeing healthy is not about being a size four, or a size 24, it’s about feeling good both physically, mentally, and emotionally. So with that being said, it’s been my New Years Resolution to be more proactive in managing my health. That means making better decisions, getting in more exercise, and drinking more water! You guys know how much I hate water. I think it’s disgusting, but I know it’s what I need to keep my body healthy. I’ve been feeling really sluggish lately, and my skin has been really dry, and I know that’s because I’m not getting enough h2O.\nBesides the taste, one of my biggest struggles with drinking water is just not thinking about it. I’m sure you can relate to this…I’m busy, I have so much going on throughout the day. Taking a moment to stop, and drink eight cups of water is not something on the forefront of my mind.\nSo when I found a water bottle that can think for me, it was the greatest thing ever! This bottle is called Hidrate Spark 2.0. It is a smart water bottle that tracks your water intake, and reminds you when it’s time to drink more. It connects to your cell phone (or fitbit) via bluetooth, allowing you to track how much water you are drinking and how much more you have to go to complete your goal.\nIn addition to sending you reminders on your phone to drink water, the water bottle glows to provide a visual reminder to stay hydrated. So, when it’s time for me to drink water, or when I am running behind, it will glow to remind me to keep drinking. And let me say, I have drunk the most water in these last three days, than what I’ve had in the last three months. Crazy!\nInside of the water bottle is a sensor stick that measures the water level inside your bottle. It records these measurement so you can see your water intake day by day, week by week. It’s this part of the bottle that glows, and you can have it set to over 10 different glow settings. It’s kind of like setting the ringer on your cellphone, you can set it to whatever is going to catch your attention.\nAnd here’s the best part…it allows you to connect with friends and family members to see how they’re doing in their goal of drinking more water. I absolutely love this, it is so awesome to have a support system that will encourage you to complete your goal, and you can support each other. Which is why I’m hoping that you will get the Hidrate Spark 2.0 as well. It would be so awesome to connect with you guys, encouraging you to drink more water and take care of your health.

{"id": "3552", "text": "All casinos in Las Vegas are larger than life, but some offer better odds for certain games than others. Even though they are equally flashy, each casino offers different payout ratios. The figures vary wildly between games, which opens up unique opportunities to players. Since not all games are created equally, some are more advantageous to play at different venues. This means that certain games feature exceptionally favorable odds, but it varies from casino to casino.\nThere’s something in Vegas for everyone, & each casino offers their own specialty. Ever since the 2008 recession, casinos have had to get creative to entice players to come to Vegas. There has been a steady stream of promotion, but few know which Vegas casinos feature the best odds for certain games. Discovering this information is essential for any responsible player, so we decided to create this list. Prepare to be blown away by these surprising hot spots. Playing the games on our list at these venues will increase your odds of winning!\nVegas Casinos With Best Odds\nThe odds in casinos can vary depending on the games you choose to play and the specific rules and variations offered. While no casino game guarantees consistent wins, some games generally have better odds for players. Additionally, within Las Vegas, different casinos may have slightly different odds for the same games. Here are some general observations:\n- Blackjack often has some of the best odds in a casino, especially if you play using basic strategy. Look for tables with favorable rules, such as those that allow you to double down on any two cards and pay 3:2 for a natural blackjack.\n- Craps is known for having favorable odds, particularly if you stick to bets with a low house edge, such as the Pass Line and Come bets.\n- Video Poker:\n- Certain variations of video poker, such as Jacks or Better, can offer players good odds if played with optimal strategy. Look for full-pay machines and paytables for the best returns.\n- Baccarat is a simple game with relatively good odds, particularly if you bet on the Banker. The house edge on the Banker bet is generally lower than on the Player bet.\n- European Roulette:\n- If you enjoy playing roulette, opt for European Roulette over American Roulette. The absence of the double zero in European Roulette reduces the house edge, improving your odds.\nIt’s important to note that slot machines generally have lower odds of winning compared to table games. However, some slot machines offer better returns than others, and it’s a good idea to check the paytables and choose machines with higher RTP (Return to Player) percentages.\nKeep in mind that even with favorable odds, casino games are designed for the house to have an edge over the long term. It’s crucial to gamble responsibly, set limits, and view casino gaming as entertainment rather than a guaranteed way to make money.\nAs the gaming landscape can change, and new variations or rules may be introduced, it’s advisable to check specific casino rules and conditions when you visit Las Vegas or any other gaming destination.\nBest Vegas Casinos for Each Casino Game\nBlackjack: Alamo Casino – Even though the strip steals the show, there’s plenty of hidden casinos in Vegas. They are scattered in the oddest places, & this valiant venue is no exception. The Alamo Casino is only a mile away from the strip, but they are worlds apart. Instead of relying on a stunning presentation, the Alamo takes a different approach. It’s located in the middle of a truck stop on the corner of Blue Diamond Road & Dean Martin Drive.\nThis means that there’s no scantily clad waitresses or million-dollar light displays. What the Alamo lacks in glamour it makes up for with quality blackjack odds. They have the most lenient Blackjack rules in Vegas, & every local knows it. Each game pays 3-2 on naturals & the dealer hits soft 17. To make matters even more enticing, late surrender is allowed & an unbusted six-card hand is an automatic win. All these factors give this casino a 0.14% house edge, making it the best odds for Blackjack in Vegas. It’s only small stakes gambling, but it’s still the perfect place to hone your skills before becoming a high roller!\nDollar Video Poker: South Point – Out of all the casinos, this one strives to pamper their customers. Their hundreds of poker machines offer a 9/6 Jacks or Better level. This sensational practice gives users a 99.54% payout rate. This lets players enjoy a slew of games with almost a 100% return rate. If that wasn’t enough, South Point took things a step further. While other casinos limit the amount of club benefits on their best machines, South Point pays full benefits. All these impressive attempts to treat customers makes this venue the mecca for video poker!\nKeno: El Cortez – Everyone knows that Keno has less than ideal odds, but there’s still hope. For years, El Cortez has brought this game back into the spotlight with a unique strategy. By loosening up the odds, they were able to get more visitors to play keno. They also underwent a major makeover, so users get to enjoy all the added amenities. Take on the odds the right way with this renegade casino!", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}
{"id": "3580", "text": "RIP Eric Boehlert. His voice will be missed.\nReflections on one of the foremost progressive media critics of our time, gone suddenly and too soon.\nI had something else written and ready to go for today’s newsletter, but in a strange twist of fate, it drew significantly from what would turn out to be Eric Boehlert’s last piece. So it feels appropriate to instead write a few words about why I think his voice will be sorely missed, especially at this time.\nIf you haven’t heard, Boehlert passed suddenly late Monday at age 57. The terrible news was announced Wednesday afternoon on Twitter by Soledad O’Brien, who said he died in a bike accident. While details remain scant, reports later emerged that Boehlert was fatally struck by a train in Montclair, New Jersey.\nI didn’t know Boehlert personally beyond occasionally exchanging DMs with him in recent years, but he was among a leading group of progressive writers I’ve been reading online for what feels like forever. After starting out as a music journalist, he wrote for outlets including Media Matters, Salon, and Daily Kos (he also wrote two books), and since January 2020 he published his work in his Press Run newsletter on Substack. He sent me a nice note wishing me well when I started with Vox in 2018. Coming from someone I had been reading for years, it meant a lot to me. And as I was considering leaving Vox to go solo last fall, the work Boehlert was doing for Press Run served an example of what I hoped Public Notice could become.\nHe had an impressive ability to metabolize political coverage across a range of mediums, including print and TV, then synthesize it in columns featuring lots of specific examples to flesh out his often provocative arguments. Boehlert described Press Run as “fearless media commentary,” and it wasn’t false advertising. I appreciated his refusal to pull punches, his willingness to call out anyone and everyone, including the MSNBCs and CNNs of the world — something left of center media watchers sometimes shy away from because they don’t want to damage professional relationships.\nBoehlert’s last post — Monday’s “Why is the press rooting against Biden?” — is a fitting testament to his skills. It’s rich with examples of how outlets like CNN and the Washington Post trampled on last Friday’s strong jobs report by framing stories about it around inflation (“Why A Great Jobs Report Can’t Save Joe Biden” read a CNN headline) or unspecified anxieties people have (“Biden Gets a Strong Jobs Report, But a Sour Mood Still Prevails” read one in the Post). He went on to connect the negative tone of that coverage with recent polling showing a plurality of Americans believe Biden has actually presided over job losses, when in fact he’s overseen historic gains.\nSunday’s “Meet the Press” round table featured two segments with assembled pundits. One focused on how immigration might be a problem for Democrats in the midterms, the other on how Trump might be a problem for Democrats in the midterms. As usual, Biden’s historic economic record was ignored.\nThat’s why, according to a recent poll, 37 percent of Americans think the economy lost jobs over the last year, when its gained 7 million. (Just 28 percent of people know jobs were up.)\nVirtually all the Beltway coverage today agrees on this central point: When it comes to the economy, Biden’s approval rating is taking a hit because Americans are freaked out by inflation. But maybe it’s taking a hit because Americans are under the false impression that jobs are disappearing. Voters don’t know what they don’t know because the press isn’t interested in telling them about record job success and an economy that’s years ahead of where experts thought it would be coming out of a global pandemic.\nIt’s hard to argue with any of that — and still hard to process that piece is Boehlert’s last. His voice and insight, which has been a constant presence in my corner of the internet for well over a decade, will be sorely missed.\nPerhaps most importantly, Boehlert’s sudden passing is a reminder that none of us should take tomorrow for granted. By all appearances his Monday was a normal day of tweeting, writing, and radio hits, and then he was gone. It’s tragic and my heart goes out to his wife, children, family, friends, and fans.\nThat’s it for today. I’ll be back with a special edition tomorrow.\nI have a little Friday treat lined up for paid subscribers that’s quite a bit lighter than my usual fare. Teaser: if you’ve ever been a fan of professional wrestling, you’ll probably enjoy it.\nTalk to you then.", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

{"id": "3590", "text": "Posted On Wednesday, Jun 03, 2020\nMay turned out to be yet another eventful month for gold markets. Investors digested the conflicting news of economies opening up businesses on one hand, and rising US - China tensions on the other. Tensions surrounding a second wave of infections in China, South Korea and Iran continued to weigh on optimism. Poor economic readings and Powell’s discouraging comments on the state of the US economy were to some extent shrugged off by risk assets. Despite rising equity markets, the weak underlying economy kept investors uneasy. This in turn supported gold above $1700 for most of the month. Gold continues to perform as it should in times of never-seen-before economic uncertainty, with prices up 14% YTD in dollar terms and 20% YTD in rupee terms.\nINVESTORS DIDN'T ‘SELL IN MAY’\nDespite a grim economic outlook, thanks to the enormous stimulus measures and aggressive rate cuts, investors hunting for higher returns flocked to equities. This drove up global indices. This was unusual from historic patterns at this time of the year. This “don’t fight the central banks” liquidity driven rally in equity markets isn’t backed by fundamentals and thus requires investor caution. For instance, S&P 500 quarterly earnings per share have fallen by 13% y-o-y. This is in fact the worst collapse since 2009. In spite of that the S&P 500 is up ~4% for the month.\nIn these times of heightened risk and uncertainty, positions in equities can potentially be hedged by allocating to gold. Gold has historically had low correlation to equities.\nDON'T BET ON A V-SHAPED RECOVERY\nAs we head into June, equities are rising on hopes that a restart in global economic activity could fuel a V-shaped recovery. A V-shaped recovery implies that once the economy hits its lowest point and lockdowns are lifted, workers will get their jobs back. Consumers will shop, socialize, travel and invest the way they did pre-Covid-19.\nThe rebound from the recession will appear V- shaped, given the sharp deterioration in economic activity but won’t be a sustainable one. There are millions of people who lost jobs and are coping because of the handouts from the government and the Fed. The policy makers have once again papered over the problems caused by the lockdowns, but can’t generate real wealth by this printing of money. Once the freebies end when things open up, not many of these will get their jobs back soon. The rebound thus will be much short lived and won’t be sustainable as there is decline in real wealth, increase in debt and less income to support.\nAlso, if people are scared of the disease and uncertain about their financial security, it is unlikely that they will get back to spending like they did prior to the pandemic. Businesses too will be nervous about restarting normal operations and rehiring. Thus, a quick rebound in economic activity seems unlikely in the near future. This will cap gains in equities and keep the increased investment demand for gold intact.\nTOO MUCH OF ANYTHING IS BAD\nMassive monetary policy easing and government relief packages have helped escape economic collapse. But the monetary inflation moonshot will have its consequences in the form of a weaker dollar. A weaker dollar and high liquidity could result in higher commodity prices as well and thus could be inflationary. Gold, known for preserving purchasing power, will be preferred asset in such times.\nINVESTORS QUESTION POWELL’S REJECTION OF NEGATIVE RATES\nThe Federal Reserve boss has insisted that he isn’t considering negative interest rates. But investors aren’t convinced. Reasons being that rates that have plummeted close to zero and central bank’s “do whatever it takes” approach to save the economy.\nYields at the short end of the Treasury curve have already turned negative in nominal terms. Also, the 10-year US Treasury bill now yields 0.64%. This is more than 100 basis points below where it began 2020. This is below most expected rates of inflation, meaning in real terms it has turned negative too. This means a long-term investor in US Treasuries is almost guaranteed to lose a small amount of purchasing power over the life of the bond. This makes holding gold a more viable option. Gold can preserve purchasing power in the upcoming negative real rate environment. This trend will be supportive for the yellow metal.\nUS-CHINA TENSIONS ARE SET TO DRIVE GOLD HIGHER\nRather than encouraging greater cooperation, Covid-19 has further soured US-China relations. Both sides are pinning the blame on the other for the origin of the pandemic and severity of the crisis. But as the pandemic continues to weaken their economies, both countries could have less appetite for further trade wars. As such the tensions between the two could manifest on other fronts such as currency, military, technology, international cooperation, and even ideology.\nIssues between the two are deep and will persist even once the pandemic and the 2020 election are over. At the core of these issues is China’s ambition to become a dominant global power and America's resistance to that. As such, tensions between the major economies seem unlikely to de-escalate soon.\nThis will have consequences for global order and wide-reaching economic ramifications. The resulting uncertainty in equity, credit and currency markets will trigger a risk-off sentiment. This will push up investment demand for alternatives like gold.\nRUPEE’S DEPRECIATION IS ADDING TO GOLD RETURNS\nThe FY20 fiscal deficit has breached its 3.8% target by 80 basis points. The Indian government is set to borrow more to fund its Rs 20 lakh crore stimulus package. This has deteriorated India's credit profile. The Indian rupee continues to depreciate against the US dollar as foreign investors flee Indian markets. The government hasn’t done much to support Covid induced economic deceleration which further dims growth prospects. Foreign outflows, rising government deficit and falling interest rates contribute to falling Rupee.\nInternational gold price is converted to Indian gold price using the prevailing Rupee-Dollar rate. Thus, a depreciating rupee is pushing up gold prices in India.\nMANY INGREDIENTS TO LEAD GOLD HIGHER\nIn conclusion, the macroeconomic backdrop has become favorable for gold. Our analysis shows that higher risk and uncertainty combined with lower opportunity cost and competitive debasement of currencies will boost investment demand for gold.\nIn the coming quarters, gold’s behavior will depend on the speed of global economic recovery. The extent of monetary and fiscal stimulus will also be important. But over the long term, Gold will play a risk diversifying role. We believe investors can use the ongoing correction to build long-term positions in Gold.\nSource: Bloomberg, World Gold Council\n|Name of the Scheme\n|This product is suitable for investors who are seeking*\n|Quantum Gold Savings Fund\nAn Open Ended Fund of Fund Scheme Investing in Quantum Gold Fund\n|• Long term returns\n• Investments in units of Quantum Gold Fund – Exchange Traded Fund whose underlying investments are in physical gold\nInvestors understand that their principal will be at Moderately High Risk\nThe views expressed here in this article / video are for general information and reading purpose only and do not constitute any guidelines and recommendations on any course of action to be followed by the reader.

As First Great Western re-branded to GWR, initial research revealed that there is no current solution for branded corporate wear, which is unique because each piece must be tagged in some way to indicate that it is work wear only.\nFinding a true recycling solution is difficult because workwear is often made of mixed fibres and features buttons and other fastenings as well as branding which may be woven into fabrics, embroidered or printed on the surface.\nGWR worked with Uniform Reuse to identify a number of routes to deal with the various types of clothing which makes up the full range of uniforms.\nThere were several challenges to consider, from the dispersal of the clothing across our network, to the types of textile the pieces were made up of. It wasn’t always possible to break materials down to the original fibre to be able to reuse them. In some cases the fabric was too worn, in others it simply couldn’t be separated. - Amie Coppin, Head of Sustainability, GWR\nItems were collected together in bins at the most populated sites such as major stations, driver facilities and office buildings. Clothing had to be debranded before disposal providing a challenge because items contain ‘tax tags’ which indicate they are not casual wear. These must be removed, adding cost and complexity to the process. To manage this bundles were then passed through the prison service, providing work to offenders who could remove the branding tags, fastenings and other elements that could not be recycled. Materials were then sent for textile recycling which included flocking for upholstery and reuse.\nThe best available solutions were found but for the future there is an opportunity to consider different textiles and how they can be broken down right from the design stage and whether different processes could be implemented to brand tag clothing.\nUltimately there are potential further gains for the rail franchises in addressing such challenges whilst preserving brand security with projects working on converting polyester to diesel and use the fabric for generation of energy. Each time a franchise changes hands there is an opportunity to pick up the threads of these challenges.\nWhat were the outcomes?\nStaff awareness increased around waste issues, GWR’s understanding of the challenges increased, noted that there is a need to improve monitoring processes for returned items.\nReducing our environmental impact, carbon smart and having a positive social impact.\nAsset / operations", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}

{"id": "3656", "text": "Successful use of a bone plate relies on the properties of the plate, the bone screws, the bone and on the accurate application of biomechanical principles. Here are the general plates fixation principles you must know.\nPlate related factors\nThe strength of a plate relies on its cross-sections; thickness is the most significant contributing factor. The strength differs with the cube of the thickness. However, it is important to use a material of suitable strength and stiffness which should be close to that of the bone. The titanium’s stiffness is closer to that of bone, while stainless steel is stiffer than titanium. Very stiff bone plates can make the bone weak after fracture healing. The plate’s contact surface is also a significant factor. The conventional plate’s surface causes reduction of blood supply under the plate, resulting in immediate post-fixation osteoporosis.\nIn the new design featuring decreased contact self-compressing plate to lessen contact surface, substantial material is removed from the plate’s undersurface between the holes, giving it an arched appearance. A conventional orthopedic plate is weak at the screw holes. The excavation lessens the stiffness of the plate to the similar level as of the screw hole area. The bone plate with this design now has even stiffness in both the areas. Such a plate may be bent in a constant curvature with a good fit of the screw head in the plate hole and still preserve the mechanical features that consistently distribute bending as well as torsional stresses over a long distance along the plate.\nThe fatigue life of plate is prolonged because its holes are protected from localized high stresses. The holes of plate are symmetrical, consistently distributed along the plate, and have oblique undercuts on the plate’s lower side. This undercut enables unhindered inclination of a lag screw up to 40? longitudinally, as well as 7? in the transverse plane, in both directions through the plate. Usage of a shaft screw as a lag screw through the plate in position of a fully threaded cortical screw provides superior static compression force. The plate’s even distribution holes allow the adjustment of the place of the plate or for the replacement of the plate for a longer plate without conflicting with any previously drilled holes.\nThe plate’s length is another important factor. A too short plate can make a construct unstable, while application of a very long plate can cause needless damage to the soft tissue.\nScrew related factors\nThe bone screws fasten a plate to the bone. The effectiveness of a screw largely depends on the design of its head. Well-made threads are easy to insert and hold well in all conditions. A well-designed slot for the screwdriver’s placement ensures ease of screw insertion. Suitable number of screws is necessary to hold the plate. A minimum of 2 in each fragment are essential to prevent rotation. The total number of screws required for plates fixation relies on the site and kind of fracture. The ratio of the pilot hole to screw’s depth depends on this ratio. Strength of the plates fixation relies on turn on the holding power of the bone screws. It is important to use strong material to make screws that can withstand heavy loads. Plates and screws should be of the same material to diminish corrosion.\nThe success of bone plates fixation relies on:\n- Plate thickness, geometry, dimensions, material used\n- Screw design, number, material, and hold in the bone\n- Bone-mechanical properties as well as the health of the bone\n- Construct- direction of load and placement of plate\n- Compression between the fragments\nBone related factors\nThe health of the bone is a factor which healthcare service providers often overlook while fixing a fracture. A young bone is dense in consistency and a screw holds good in such a bone. As the holding power of a screw is dependent on the elastic force offered by the bone, it’s obvious that the denser the bone, the stronger the hold. In the elderly people, the bone is porotic, being less dense than young bone. The holding elasticity of porotic bone is a lower magnitude as well as leads to inferior screw hold. Therefore, the mechanical properties of bone and health are of importance in this context.\nThe bone’s interaction and the plate are important, since the 2 are combined in a composite structure that becomes a vital entity in the strength of a fixation. The strength of a plate-bone construct is its capability to withstand load without structural failure. However, we can describe this entity as a torsional strength or a bending strength, depending on the load application. An orthopedic plate is a load sharing device. Loads may transmit between plate as well as bone through the bone screws and through friction kind of forces between the plate surface and the bone. The plate supports some of the load and some load passes between the fragments of bone. The reconstructed bone must support a certain load.", "scores": {"score": 3, "score_transform_1": 5, "score_transform_2": 5, "score_transform_3": 0}}

Uptime monitoring is not just about keeping a website running; it’s about ensuring consistent, dependable user access and safeguarding the business’s online presence.\nAs we delve into the world of uptime monitoring and its seamless integration with comprehensive IT solutions, think of it as constructing a robust, invisible shield that keeps your digital presence strong, reliable, and unyielding.\nUnderstanding Uptime Monitoring\nUptime monitoring is a critical aspect of website management, serving as the heartbeat monitor for your online presence. Simply put, it’s the process of continuously checking whether a website is available and accessible to users. Here are a few of its key components:\n- Availability checks: Regular checks to ensure the website is reachable.\n- Performance tracking: Monitoring the speed and responsiveness of the site.\n- Alert systems: Immediate notifications in case of downtime.\nWhy is Uptime Crucial?\nEvery minute your website is down can translate to significant revenue losses and missed opportunities. Imagine an online store experiencing downtime during a high-traffic sale period – the financial implications can be substantial.\nEqually important is the user experience. In an era where users expect lightning-fast and constant access, a slow or inaccessible website isn’t just an inconvenience; it’s a potential deal-breaker.\nFurthermore, uptime is a critical player in the realm of search engine optimization (SEO). Search engines prioritize reliable websites in their rankings. A website that is frequently down is seen as less trustworthy, negatively affecting its visibility in search results.\nComprehensive IT Solutions for Enhanced Reliability\nWhen discussing comprehensive IT solutions, we refer to a holistic approach to managing and maintaining a business’s technological infrastructure. These solutions encompass a wide range of services, from hardware maintenance and software updates to cybersecurity and data management. But how exactly do they contribute to website reliability?\nAt the core of these solutions is the integration of uptime monitoring. This integration isn’t just about adding another tool to the toolbox; it’s about creating a synergistic relationship between various IT components and uptime monitoring practices.\nFor example, by coupling uptime monitoring with robust server management, businesses can preemptively identify and resolve potential issues before they escalate into downtime. Additionally, incorporating real-time analytics allows for a deeper understanding of website performance trends, enabling more informed decisions to optimize uptime.\nThis synergy is evident in the offerings of companies like Service Express, which provide comprehensive IT solutions that are tailor-made to enhance website reliability. By leveraging their expertise, businesses can ensure their website’s uptime and optimize overall IT performance, making their digital presence both resilient and efficient.\nBenefits of Integrating Uptime Monitoring\nThe integration of uptime monitoring with comprehensive IT solutions offers a plethora of benefits that can significantly impact a business’s bottom line and brand reputation. Let’s explore some of these key advantages:\nEnhanced Real-time Problem Detection and Resolution\nWith integrated uptime monitoring, businesses gain the ability to detect and address issues in real time. This immediate responsiveness not only minimizes the duration of downtime but also mitigates the associated costs and customer dissatisfaction. It’s like having a vigilant guardian constantly overseeing your website’s health, ready to act at the first sign of trouble.\nImproved User Experience and Trust\nA consistently available and high-performing website naturally cultivates a positive user experience. Customers are more likely to return to a site that is reliably accessible, fast, and efficient. This reliability builds trust, an invaluable asset in the digital world. Trust leads to customer loyalty, and loyalty often translates into sustained revenue.\nOther key benefits of integrated uptime monitoring include:\n- Operational efficiency: Streamlined IT operations through automated monitoring and alerts.\n- Data-driven decisions: Access to uptime data aids in making informed strategic decisions.\n- Competitive edge: High website reliability can be a differentiator in competitive markets.\nStrategies for Effective Integration\nImplementing uptime monitoring as a part of comprehensive IT solutions requires a strategic approach to ensure its effectiveness. Here are some key strategies businesses should consider:\nSelecting the Right Tools\nThe first step is selecting uptime monitoring tools that align with your business needs and IT infrastructure. Look for tools that offer comprehensive features like performance tracking, real-time alerts, and detailed reporting.\nIntegration with Existing IT Infrastructure\nSeamless integration with existing IT infrastructure is crucial. This includes ensuring compatibility with your server environments, web platforms, and other critical systems. The goal is to create a cohesive ecosystem where uptime monitoring and other IT components work in harmony.\nSetting Up Effective Alert Systems\nEffective alert systems are vital. They should be configured to promptly notify the appropriate personnel of any issues, enabling swift action. Tailoring alert thresholds and types based on the severity and nature of the potential problems can enhance efficiency.\nRegular Review and Optimization\nIt’s essential to review and optimize your uptime monitoring strategy regularly. This involves analyzing performance data, identifying trends, and making adjustments to improve effectiveness. It’s a continuous cycle of assessment and enhancement.\nTraining and Awareness\nEnsuring your team is well-trained and aware of the importance of uptime monitoring and how to respond to alerts is also vital. This fosters a proactive culture towards maintaining website reliability.\nConclusion and Future Outlook\nAs we’ve discussed, the effective implementation of uptime monitoring involves selecting the right tools, ensuring seamless integration, setting up effective alert systems, and committing to regular review and optimization.\nLooking ahead, the future of uptime monitoring is likely to see further advancements. Technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are set to play a more prominent role, potentially offering even more sophisticated monitoring and predictive analytics capabilities. This could lead to even quicker identification and resolution of issues, further bolstering website reliability.", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}

{"id": "3716", "text": "The law states that supplements are products taken by mouth that contain a dietary ingredient.\nWith 92% of the U.S. population deficient in at least one nutrient, supplementation may seem like the best solution.\nHowever, considering the loose terminology defining what they are, is it okay to be giving your child a supplement and what should you look out for?\nWe’ve compacted the most common dietary deficiencies in this article to see whether supplements for kids is right for you.\nWhy Are Our Children Deficient in Nutrients?\nNutritional foods including fresh fruit, veggies, and meats are more expensive than their processed counterparts. The difference in cost and convenience is thought to cause this epidemic. This extra expense can’t be justified by many families across the U.S. who are on a low income.\nChildren that live off processed foods are highly likely to have a deficiency and parents, or guardians should consider a supplement.\nFamilies that can afford nutritious food may still have a child with a deficiency, especially fussy eaters.\nFurther, any child with a food allergy or medical condition (especially digestive diseases) may require supplementation.\nWhat Can We Do to Help?\nThe first answer is a well-balanced healthy diet full of fresh fruit, veggies, and lean protein. Children that have vegetarian or vegan diets will require supplementation to make up for the lack of animal products in their diets.\nIf a well-balanced diet is unsustainable due to financial, medical or dietary limitations, then your child may require supplementation.\nThere are also many other supplements for kids available on the market, see more here.\n3 million Americans live with this disease which triggers an autoimmune response when gluten is consumed. The inflammation in the intestines doesn’t allow for anymore nutrient absorption and this is how a deficiency is started.\nSymptoms include abdominal pain, nausea, anemia, tiredness, and weight loss.\nCutting gluten out of the diet allows for all other nutrients to be absorbed. Some supplements will contain gluten, and these will also have to be avoided.\nIf your child suffers from Celiac Disease, they should be able to absorb all required nutrients once the initial inflammation has settled. During this period, they may require supplementation.\nVegetarian or Vegan Diets\nVitamin B12 is found in animal products only and therefore lacking when following a plant-based diet. This is an important nutrient that helps make your DNA and red blood cells.\nSymptoms can include tiredness, weakness, pale skin, vision loss, and mental problems.\nVitamin B12 is widely available in tablets, liquid and injection form. If your child has a digestive disease, they may require injections as they are unable to fully absorb vitamin B12 by regular oral intake and digestion.\n97% of Americans are deficient in protein. Protein is made up of amino acids. These are the building blocks to all structures, tissues, and organs in your body. Protein is used in a child’s body to help them grow and develop muscles.\nProtein is found in lean meats, fish, dairy and beans. A well-balanced diet will avoid this deficiency.\nSymptoms of protein deficiency may include weak and underdeveloped muscles, poor injury recovery and weak immune system. It may also stunt your child’s growth and development.\nProtein supplements are widely available in many forms including bars, powder, drinks, and high protein dairy products. You should look for whey protein supplements, which contain all essential amino acids.\nCalcium and Vitamin D Deficiency\nThese 2 nutrients are paired together because they both need each other to perform their roles in the body. Vitamin D is needed for strong bones as it helps the body absorb and make use of dietary calcium.\nBoth nutrients are essential for strong bones.\nDairy products contain vitamin D and calcium together. Your skin makes vitamin D when exposed to sunlight. Calcium comes from your diet only.\nIf your child has a dairy or sun allergy or follows a vegan diet, then they could be lacking in both vitamin D and calcium.\nSymptoms may include brittle bones or an ill-formed skeletal system.\nA high-fiber diet can prevent high cholesterol and constipation. Ketogenic or low carb diets may result in a lack of fiber.\nThe first and most obvious symptom of a fiber deficiency is constipation. If your child regularly suffers from constipation, then it is probably time to increase their fiber intake. This can come from fibrous fruit and vegetables along with whole grains.\nIf your child is still not getting enough fiber then use a fiber supplement. These come in powder, tablets, and drinks.\nSupplements for Kids: What Next?\nThere are many other nutrients that your child could be deficient in.\nA daily multivitamin and mineral supplement that is designed for your child’s age will benefit their health, even if you think their diet is suitable. Always follow instructions on the packet and it is best to consult a medical professional beforehand.\nA child with any health condition or taking any medication should always see their doctor before starting a supplement. Some supplements can interact with prescription medication.\nSupplementation of specific nutrients is best left to the professionals. They can diagnose the exact problem and prescribe a course of treatment.\nIf you think your child is suffering from a nutrient deficiency, then consult a medical professional first.\nIf you have read this and think you’re deficient and may need a supplement, then check out our article on adult supplementation.", "scores": {"score": 3, "score_transform_1": 5, "score_transform_2": 5, "score_transform_3": 0}}

The >outcome was the worst mass shooting incident in U.S. history . Omar Mateen, 29, a U.S.-born son of Afghan immigrants, killed 50 people and injured at least 53 using both a handgun and a “long gun”, thought to be an AR-15-style assault rifle. This bloodshed, which marked the 16th mass shooting during the presidency of Barack Obama, speaks to that plague of peaceful American society: gun proliferation bolstered by constitutional protection under the Second Amendment, and relentless lobbying on Capitol Hill by the National Rifle Association, with its deep pockets. Mateen, who was known to have ranted about gay people in the past, meticulously targeted the gay nightclub, reflecting the persistence of deep prejudices about the community, notwithstanding the U.S. Supreme Court’s >landmark decision nearly a year ago upholding marriage equality . While the latest attack is another grim bookmark in the annals of gun control reform and hate crimes against the LGBT community, the standout dimension of the incident is without doubt the creeping menace of “lone wolf” attacks linked to Islamic State (IS), and the prognosis for the American security state.\nThe surest sign of the heightened political temperature surrounding domestic terrorism of this sort came from the instant reactions of the two presumptive presidential candidates, Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton. While both >focussed on scoring political points , neither sought to tackle the phenomenon of mounting lone wolf attacks. On Sunday, Mateen said on a call >he made to the 911 emergency line that he swore allegiance to IS . Experts have noted that such a pledge has come to be considered a core element of the IS “protocol”. In December 2015, the San Bernardino, California, attackers posted such an oath of allegiance on Facebook. In May 2015, the shooter at a cartoon exhibit displaying images of the Prophet Muhammad in Texas posted tweets pledging loyalty to IS. These public pledges prior to a violent attack eerily mesh with the recent exhortations of IS spokesman Abu Muhammad al-Adnani, who called on supporters to kill innocents in the U.S. and Europe during the holy month of Ramzan. Without overreach that would amount to curbing civil liberties, the U.S. surveillance and security apparatus would have to respond with a higher level of creativity to deal with lone wolf strikes. Significantly, the Federal Bureau of Investigation had interviewed Mateen twice but found no evidence of any terror links. In the U.S. it is all too easy for a psychotic, bigoted or otherwise unstable individual with leanings towards jihadist extremism to act out his beliefs in the land that has one gun for every human being.", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}

{"id": "3771", "text": "How to make changes that will have an immediate impact\nA safe workplace is a right every worker deserves to have, so promoting a culture of safety is crucial. Healthcare employees face significant risks despite technological advancements, leading many to wonder what organization leaders can do to mitigate dangers. Here are four safety measures often ignored in the industry and the actions you can take to implement them.\n1. Manage exposure and illness\nHealthcare staff confront several hazards, including exposure to infectious diseases. They touch many surfaces during a single patient interaction. Hygienic practices can easily slip their minds during busy days.\nStaff handling patients are required to observe hand hygiene in five critical moments of interaction, including before contact, before any procedure, after exposure, after contact with the patient and post-contact with their environment. Ensure they clean their hands with soap and water or alcohol-based products to break the chain of infection.\n2. Implement ergonomic practices\nThose manually supporting patients are at an elevated risk of physical strain and injuries. Ergonomic practices are often disregarded, leading to serious accidents that could have been avoided.\nOne way to support your workers is by minimizing or eliminating manual lifting of patients and using assistive devices, such as lifts and transfer equipment. It avoids awkward positions that increase pressure on the spine and joints. You should train staff on how to use these items properly, encourage proper body mechanics and apply ergonomic knowledge to their daily lifting tasks.\n3. Improve communication\nIn a workplace where many people are involved, effective communication is vital for the safety of healthcare workers and patients. Instructions that aren't clear will be open to misinterpretations and potential mistakes at work.\nEnsure you communicate workplace policy updates so everyone understands and can comply with them. Regarding patient information, a tool that allows interdisciplinary collaboration and data sharing among the healthcare team can streamline the workflow process. In addition, it can improve patient experience and outcomes and avoid mistakes in interpreting reports.\n4. Eliminate distractions\nDistractions are normal in any workplace. However, in health care, one second of interruption can result in a situation with severe consequences that compromise patient safety. According to data, distracting noises from alarms, bells and telephones occur about 95 times during a single surgical case. Surgeons are distracted 44% of the time and the operating room door opens and closes as often as 41 times per procedure.\nWhether it's a computer alert, background noise or a question raised by another clinician, distraction-related errors, unfortunately, happen in healthcare settings. It doesn't just affect the patients but also the staff.\nSome practical ways to minimize distractions are:\n- Establishing a no-interruption zone in specific areas like operating rooms\n- Ensuring staff are educated to comply with the rules\n- Managing devices, including alarms and notification alerts\n- Making a checklist so it’s easy to return to tasks after being interrupted\nSome hospitals in Canada install OR black boxes that capture patients' vital signals, audio, video and other data to make the procedures safer. The recordings are sent to the International Centre for Surgical Safety (ICSS) in Toronto for review. These measures can help staff be more present, especially when doing tasks requiring high concentration.\nPrioritizing safety can improve staff’s well-being\nAfter analyzing these safety measures, everything boils down to having clear and appropriate protocols your staff can follow to minimize health risks in your organization.\nWhether it's managing exposure, implementing proper body mechanics when lifting patients, enhancing communication or removing interruptions, setting the right policies is the primary solution to mitigating risks in health care.", "scores": {"score": 3, "score_transform_1": 5, "score_transform_2": 5, "score_transform_3": 0}}

This new Writing Center also welcomes a new director, Dr. Christine Olding. Dr. Olding is a Humanities and Communications professor at Trine University, and has had experience with writing centers before and has a passion for teaching writing.\n“I worked at Kent State as the Assistant Writing Director,” Olding said, “And when I was a master’s student at the University of Dayton, I was a graduate tutor.” Dr. Olding also went on to discuss the reasons she enjoys being a part of writing centers.\n“I really enjoy working with a student population outside of a classroom,” Olding said, “It gives me a different perspective of the lives that they lead, the passions that they have, and different ways that we can help them.” With a new director, the Amy Salyer-Nicholls Writing Center is also in a new location this fall. After their year in Shambaugh Hall, they have moved into the LINK to provide better access and convenience to students. This move has seen more students visit the Writing Center.\n“…so far we have seen more students than we would have if we were in Shambaugh [Hall] still,” Olding said, “We have a wonderful new space that is directly connected to the library, which I think will bring a lot of new students in here.”\nThe Amy Salyer-Nicholls Writing Center is located on the first floor of the LINK, in what was previously the Student Activities Office. Hours of operation are Monday through Friday 10a.m. to 3p.m. There are a multitude of tutors that specialize in various subjects, such as technical communication, social sciences, business writing, etc.\nAnother new addition to the Writing Center is the introduction of e-tutoring appointments. Students will no longer be required to physically go into the Writing Center to receive help. E-tutoring appointments will connect students to a tutor online.\n“The e-tutoring appointments are a way for students to make appointments, get the guidance and support they need, even if they are unable to physically come into the center, or if they feel too embarrassed to come to the Writing Center,” Olding said, “It provides them that outlet, so they can still do it, but without letting anybody know.” E-tutoring appointments are available on the trine.mywconline.com, along with regularly scheduled appointments.\nThe final new addition to the Writing Center are workshops. These are dedicated to improving writing skills in all Trine students. These workshops will work to improve fundamental skills in writing.

{"id": "3807", "text": "Welcome to Through the Psalms, a weekend ministry of the Truth Pulpit, teaching God's people God's Word. Over time, we'll study all 150 Psalms with Pastor Don Green from Truth Community Church in Cincinnati, Ohio.\nWe're so glad you're with us. Let's open to the Psalms right now as we join our teacher in the Truth Pulpit. In Psalm 141, I'd like to read the Psalm in its entirety as we begin.\nPsalm 141, a psalm of David. Do not watch over the door of my lips. Do not incline my heart to any evil thing, to practice deeds of wickedness with men who do iniquity, and do not let me eat of their delicacies. Let the righteous smite me in kindness and reprove me.\nIt is oil upon the head. Do not let my head refuse it, for still my prayer is against their wicked deeds. Their judges are thrown down by the sides of the rock, and they hear my words, for they are pleasant.\nAs when one plows and breaks open the earth, our bones have been scattered at the mouth of Sheol. For my eyes are toward you, O God the Lord. In you I take refuge.\nDo not leave me defenseless. Keep me from the jaws of the trap which they have set for me, and from the snares of those who do iniquity. Let the wicked fall into their own nets, while I pass by safely. This psalm is a very interesting juxtaposition of a desire for sanctification and also a prayer for help against enemies in life. And it's almost unique in the sharp contrast of those desires, as you see David earnestly pleading that the Lord would keep him on the path of righteousness, while at the same time recognizing his enemies and asking God to, as it were, to keep me and to judge them. And so we're in the middle of this four Psalm set, Psalms 140 through Psalm 143, where David is seeking help from his enemies. And let me just remind you of the context of the different Psalms. In Psalm 140, verse 1, you read him saying, Rescue me, O Lord, from evil men. Preserve me from violent men.\nYou see the theme right from the start there. Here in our Psalm this evening in verse 9, he says, Keep me from the jaws of the trap which they have set for me, and from the snares of those who do iniquity. Let the wicked fall into their own nets. And then in Psalm 142, verse 6, in the middle of the verse, David says, Deliver me from my persecutors, for they are too strong for me. And then in verse 12 of Psalm 143, In your lovingkindness, cut off my enemies and destroy all those who afflict my soul, for I am your servant. And so it's always good for us to see how the Psalms were arranged, and whoever the compiler was, it very well may have been Ezra at the end of the Old Testament era of Revelation. But it's good to just see that there was a structure and an order and themes that were being put together as the Psalms were compiled. And we take those things into account as we read and interpret the Psalms as we go along. Here in Psalm 141, David is using the threat from his enemies as a motivation to pursue holiness.\nThat's not often the way that we think about the opposition that comes to us. Our first thought is often to justify ourselves and how dare they and all of that. David, rather, sees this as an opportunity to grow in grace and to grow in the knowledge of God and grow in his personal holiness. And so this is one of the key themes in the Psalm, and we're going to see it as we look at our first section here tonight, which I've titled An Urgent Prayer for Help. He opens with an urgent prayer for help. As so often happens in the Psalms, David asks God to hurry to his side and help him. Look at those first two verses with me again. He says, Yahweh, I call upon you.\nHasten to me. Give ear to my voice when I call to you. And he's asking God to do more than simply receive it through his divine ear, so to speak. He's asking God to hear and to respond to him.\nAnd that's what he's asking. God, I need your help. I'm calling upon you. Hasten. Give ear.\nIn other words, respond to me quickly, because the situation is urgent. Now, we do not know the occasion of this Psalm, in other words, what the circumstances were that David was experiencing when he wrote this Psalm. We don't know. There's no clues in the Psalms to tell us. But whatever the circumstances, the key thing, and what gives it its transcendent value to us here today, we're in Psalm 141. David was in the middle of a situation that was growing increasingly desperate. The situation was pressing upon him, and he could tell that it was going from bad to worse.\nThere was no relief on the horizon. And so that's the situation. That's the spiritual occasion of it. He is asking God to respond to him quickly in response to the prayer that he is making. And he likens his prayer there in verse 2. He compares it to incense and to the evening offering.\nLook at it there in verse 2. He says, May my prayer be counted as incense before you, the lifting up of my hands as the evening offering. Now, for us in our day, that sounds kind of remote and seems kind of unclear what is saying. We wouldn't speak that way. We don't speak in terms, God, let my prayer be to you as incense.\nWe don't use incense. And so it doesn't, you know, it doesn't immediately strike our New Testament ears with an obvious sense of what David is saying here. It would seem if we compare Scripture to Scripture, which is the proper way to interpret the Bible, that he is referring to the appointed offerings that Moses established back in the Pentateuch.\nIf you go back to the book of Exodus chapter 29 with me, Exodus 29, as we just see a little bit of brief historical background here to help us interpret what David is saying in this psalm, in Exodus chapter 29 verse 38, God is instructing Moses on how the offerings are to be conducted and what Aaron is to do as the high priest. In verse 38 it says this, Now this is what you shall offer on the altar, two one-year-old lambs each day continuously, the one lamb you shall offer in the morning and the other lamb you shall offer at twilight. There is an evening offering that was made as part of the God-appointed sacrifices, which were a shadow of the future coming of Christ.\nNow if you just go across the page or maybe turn one page to chapter 30 in verse 7, you'll see this. We read, Aaron shall burn fragrant incense on it. He shall burn it every morning when he trims the lamps. When Aaron trims the lamps at twilight, he shall burn incense.\nThere shall be perpetual incense before the Lord throughout your generations. And so God, from the very beginning after he had delivered the people of Israel from slavery in Egypt, he established this system of worship, you could say, this system that involved animal sacrifices and the burning of incense as part of the appointed means of approaching him in that time. And God was pleased with these regular offerings. This is what he wanted them to do. And when they were offered in the right spirit, God accepted them and blessed the one who offered them. And so this is the background that David has in mind. And what he is saying as we go back to Psalm 141 now, when he says, May my prayer be counted as incense before you, the lifting up of my hands as the evening offering.\nHe's saying this. He's saying, God, just as you accept those sacrifices from the high priest, it's what you appointed, and when it's offered according to your will, it's something that pleases you. He's saying, God, accept my prayer now in this time of crisis in the same way. Regard it as something that you have appointed for me to do. Let it be found pleasing in your sight, because if it's pleasing in your sight, you will answer me, and you will respond, and you'll help me in my predicament. And so he's looking back to the sacrifices that God appointed, and he's using them as an analogy to the way that he would ask God to receive his prayer now.\nGod, it's urgent. God, treat it as something that you receive well, that you accept and therefore respond to me. Now, he goes on and he says, there at the end of verse 2, my prayer be counted as incense before you.\nHere we go. The lifting up of my hands as the evening offering. In that day, the lifting up of hands was a symbolic way of expressing dependence and praise, of looking to receive blessing from heaven coming down. Your hands are reaching up to receive the blessing coming down from heaven, and also to lift up and to offer up praise to God. And so the raised hands that he describes there is not so much the physical aspect of the mere lifting up of his hands, but rather it's referring to the spirit in which he is praying. God, I am praying to you in dependence.\nI trust you. I'm praying in faith, and I'm praying with a recognition of your greatness, your goodness, and your grace, and I offer this prayer in worship and also in a sense of dependence. And so he's praying for help, and he's asking God to hurry and answer him. Hasten to me.\nGive ear to me, he says. And so that's the opening sense of the psalm. It's an urgent prayer for help. Now, if it were you and I having opened like that, you might expect to just go directly into the urgent need that you had and explain the problem and ask God to come and help in greater detail than what he did in the opening, but that's not what David does. And we come to our second point here this evening where we see a humble prayer for sanctification, a humble prayer for sanctification, particularly when David's need is so urgent.\nIt is striking. It stands out that in this psalm, the first thing that he does is he looks within at the state of his own soul. Look at verse 3. He has enemies all about him, and we see that not just in this psalm, but in the psalm that preceded and in the two that followed.\nThere's a strong emphasis on personal opposition that's taking place here. And yet what is the first actual prayer that comes out of David's lip? What's his first request? He says here in verse 3, look at it. He says, set a guard, O Lord, over my mouth.\nKeep watch over the door of my lips. And those phrases are in parallel. You know, there's a parallelism there. He's saying the same thing with both sets of clauses there.\nHe's just repeating them for emphasis. God, watch my mouth. Work in my heart so that I don't speak in a way that would be displeasing to you, so that I would not sin against you with my lips.\nGuard what I say so that I don't say anything that is displeasing to you, and don't let anything through the door of my mouth that you would not want to have come out. And so David's first actual prayer request here is he is concerned that he would glorify the Lord with his tongue, with his mouth. And as you read the Psalms of David, it's very instructive, it's very humbling to contemplate it personally for many of us. It's also very endearing to see the King of Israel praying with this kind of spiritual sensitivity and this kind of tenderness in his heart before the Lord. And this is far from the only time where David has prayed in such a manner. In Psalm 19, you don't need to turn there, but that great Psalm where he reflects on God's glory and natural revelation in the first six verses, and then God's glory and the specific revelation in his written word in verses 7 through 12 there in Psalm 19, he closes that Psalm after meditating on the stars and meditating on the Scriptures. He's looked at the skies, he's looked at the Scripture. His closing prayer is this, Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable in your sight, O Lord, my rock and my Redeemer.\nIt's the exact same thing that we see here in Psalm 141. He reflects on his situation, he prays to God, and his heart goes to the fact that he wants his heart to be tender, to be teachable, to be sanctified, to reflect the Spirit of God in what he says. That's his prayer.\nThat's what he wants. He is focused on his own personal sanctification in what he is saying. He does the same thing at the end of another very well-known Psalm, which we just looked at a couple of weeks ago, Psalm 139.\nSince you're right by that, why don't you just look over at Psalm 139 for a moment. You remember that he's reflected on the omniscience of God. God's intimately acquainted with all of his ways. He's reflected on the omnipresence of God. Where can I flee from your presence?\nAnywhere I go, you're there, and so you know me and you are with me. He reflects on the omnipotence of God to have formed him in his mother's womb and to appoint all of the days of David's life before there was one of them. Just magnificent theological reflection that he is engaging in.\nBut he's not speaking, he's not writing as a dry theologian, he's not writing for the sake of abstract principle here. He is worshiping God, and he's worshiping God not only in ascribing praise to God, but submitting his soul to the sanctifying influence of God and asking God to keep him from sin and to cause him to grow in grace. And so he closes that magnificent meditation in the heart of Psalm 139. He closes it with these two verses there, beginning in verse 23, where he says, Search me, O God, and know my heart, try me, and know my anxious thoughts, and see if there be any hurtful way in me, and lead me in the everlasting way. This is an ongoing prayer of David where he recognizes the temptation for his mouth to speak out of turn. He realizes that his tongue is a threat to godliness, that he can do damage to men with what he says, and that he can sin against God vertically by what comes out of his lips. And so David, before there even was a New Testament, recognized a very important New Testament principle, that our mouths can be instruments for sin, instruments of evil, particularly when we are under provocation of adverse circumstances or the provocation of people who are opposed to us for some reason. So we read in James chapter 3 verse 6.\nAgain, you don't need to turn there. But just to remind you of the familiar verse, James said, The tongue is a fire, the very world of iniquity. The tongue is set among our members as that which defiles the entire body, and sets on fire the course of our life, and is set on fire by hell. So we see this Old Testament.\nWe see this New Testament. We realize that our tongues are a problem. What comes out of our mouth is often the source of much conflict.\nIt inflicts much hurt on those that are near us. And so if we are aware of this, then it affects the way that we pray. And I don't think it's too much to say at all that we would ask for God's help in this matter like David did. We would ask for help more often if we were more conscious of the threat or if we took the threat more seriously. The problem is that we tend towards self-righteousness and self-justification, and therefore I'm going to say what's on my mind.\nI'll speak my peace here without regard to what the effect of it is or without regard to the need to say the truth in love. And so we're challenged by what we see here. David, under provocation, David in the presence of his enemies, the first words that are coming out of his mouth is, God, keep me from speaking wrongly in what comes in the near future of my life. And so David here is asking for—here's a little summary of it— David is asking God for supernatural help to overcome his spiritual vulnerability to sin with his speech. He's asking God to give him supernatural help. He's praying to a supernatural God. So he's asking for supernatural help to overcome his spiritual vulnerability to sinning with his speech. Now, you know, some of us are, you know, we talk a lot, that's okay.\nIt's okay to be a verbal person, but the more verbal you are, the more important it is to have a sense of dependence on God and looking to God to help you guard your lips so that you would not sin in your speech, because the Scriptures make it clear that spiritual force can be set aflame with a spark that comes from a careless lip. And for those of us that love Christ, that love his church, that love his people, that love our families, how important it is for us to be saying, God, give me wisdom. God, sanctify me. God, I pray that your Spirit would develop more his fruit in my life, love and joy and peace and patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control. God, that's what I want.\nI want you to work out that in me. That's the kind of thing that David is praying about. And then he goes further as we go on into verse 4. He's asking God, in verse 4, to direct his heart to godly things.\nAnd he's just going to the very core of his being, just laying his heart out before the Lord. And he says in verse 4, Do not incline my heart to any evil thing, to practice deeds of wickedness with men who do iniquity, and do not let me eat of their delicacies. You know, this verse where he's asking God to incline his heart in the direction of righteousness, it reminds me of the Lord's instruction in what's known as the Lord's Prayer, where the Lord taught us to pray, Do not lead us into temptation, but deliver us from evil.\nAnd you see, beloved, and I say this to you gently, I say it to help you, to encourage you, and knowing that for the decades in which I've been a Christian that I've failed in this more than I have succeeded. But for us to recognize that this is the way that God tells us to pray. He's instructing us to pray in a way that would increase our sanctification, and that we would be mindful of our hearts that are prone to wander, our hearts which are so easily tempted to sin, our hearts which are so easy to betray trust, and to sin against others and sin against God in a multitude of ways, recognizing that we have a heart that still, even as believers, has remnants of sin like that that can flare up at any time. Scripture teaches us to proactively ask for God's help in advance, saying, God, keep me away from that sin and increase righteousness in me. This is the mark of true godly praying. This is the mark of those who are walking with God, that they desire that enough to pray for it. And so you see, as I've said many times when I've taught on prayer, when it comes, you know, a lot of times when people realize, oh, I've fallen into a time of prayerlessness, I need to pray more. I've said for years, and I'll say it again tonight, that's not where you really want to start, to just start praying more. What you need to do is to step back and consider the entire attitude of your heart, what should be the priorities in prayer, not simply to go in and start repeating the same rote prayers or memorized prayers or just going through the same prayer list again and again and again, as if simply punching the prayer time clock was enough to satisfy what God requires from us and wants from us and invites from us in prayer. No, we have to go and say, okay, what are the priorities of God here?\nAnd where am I, you know, what are the vulnerabilities? What did the Lord teach us to pray? He taught us to praise God and, you know, our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be your name, your kingdom come, your will be done, a prayer of worship, a prayer of submission, submitting ourselves to the will of God, and then going on, Lord, provide for my needs today, forgive my sins as we forgive our debtors, and do not lead us into temptation but deliver us from evil.\nYou see, my whole point in that extended sidebar there is that God has taught us how to pray, and we need to contemplate that and internalize it and let it come back out of our mouth after we've internalized it in the way that we pray to him. It's obvious that David had meditated deeply on the holiness of God, the law of God, and that this is what we see coming out in the inspired writings that the Spirit of God has left for us. And so, go back to verse 4 with those things said. David here, again, we're in the middle of a prayer for sanctification. Verse 3, God, keep me from sinning with my mouth.\nAnd then, God, going deeper, work in my heart, work in my affections, work in my inner man, work in my conscience. Make my conscience sensitive to sin, even if it's already very sensitive, Lord, keep my conscience pure and clean that I would not be inclined to break your law. And so, verse 4, do not incline my heart to practice deeds of wickedness with men who do iniquity. And, you know, just to clarify here, David is not concerned that God would prompt him to do something evil, so God, instead of leading me into evil, instead lead me into something righteous.\nThat's not it at all. James says that God does not tempt anyone to sin. And so, it's not that we don't need to pray that God would, you know, would prompt us to do evil things.\nRather, what David is saying in a negative way is this. He's simply asking God to control the first motions of his heart, that the impulses of his heart would be inclined toward godliness and not toward sin. He's asking God, work in my heart, sanctify my heart in the deepest recesses of who I am. God, I ask that your Spirit would be creating righteous desires in me, creating godly affections in me so that the course of my life is guided by an inner control center that is pursuing after you. In other words, God, here's my heart, oh take and seal it, seal it for your courts above. That's the spirit of what David is praying here. And so, as he goes on there in verse 4, he says, don't incline me to be with men who do iniquity, do not let me eat of their delicacies. What's he saying there? Well, often the wicked prosper, the wicked become wealthy and enjoy some of the finer things of life, and those sensual luxuries that they sometimes enjoy can be outwardly appealing, saying, oh, if only I had that.\nLook how they eat, or look at what they drive, or look at where they live. Divorced from the prosperity of the wicked that we see described in Psalm 73, that's where the psalmist in Psalm 73 went astray. He saw the prosperity of the wicked, and he was jealous of them, and he started to want that. And he nearly stumbled badly, as you read in Psalm 73. David is ahead of the game here in Psalm 141. He's ahead of the curve of where Psalm 73 came in, and he says, God, I want you to incline me away from all of that. Like Daniel, when he was taken off to Babylon, he said, he didn't want to eat the king's luxuries. He said, just feed me the vegetables.\nI'll be fine with that. And so David here in verse 4, he is renouncing, he is rejecting the carnal lifestyle that would tempt him away from obedience and sanctification. He's saying, God, my heart might be otherwise inclined to go after the things that wicked people enjoy, and there's a certain sensual appeal to it. There is a passing pleasure to sin that the book of Hebrews describes. David says, I don't want that passing pleasure. I want to live a life that is righteous and pleasing in your sight.\nAnd so you see just the deep godliness that was marking David as he's praying in this way. And he's mindful of the fact that, in the language of 1 Corinthians 15, that bad company corrupts good morals. Bad company corrupts good morals. David says, keep me away from the people that would corrupt my morality.\nAnd we hardly need any illustration of the fact that this is a very real danger for young and old alike. You need to guard who your friends are, especially you young people, as you're kind of setting the course for your future life. You need to choose your friends wisely. You need to avoid those that are obviously loving evil, that are disobedient and outwardly defiant to their parents.\nYou need to stay away from friends like that and not drink it in. Scripture warns us not to associate those that are given to anger lest you learn their ways and become like them. So we need to be discerning in our friendships, discerning in our relationships, discerning over what we choose to pursue with our life. David goes on and he takes it even a step further as we read in verse 5. He says, let the righteous smite me in kindness and reprove me.\nIt is oil upon the head. Do not let my head refuse it, for still my prayer is against their wicked deeds. What David is saying here is, God, I am willing to receive correction from godly people. He says, let righteous people smite me in kindness and reprove me. If there is something wicked in my life, if there is something that is askew in me spiritually, O God, I pray that there would be righteous people in my life who would reprove me and rebuke me for it. They will be doing me a benefit. They will be giving me a blessing if they recognize sin in my life and reprove it in a way that restores me to the path of righteousness.\nThat's what he's praying here. And what we see in this is that part of sanctification, and you know, if you remember David, you remember when Nathan came and rebuked him about his sin with Bathsheba, and David heard it and repented. The prophet came and rebuked the king, and the king responded to it.\nWell, part of sanctification is accountability to spiritual authority, beloved. And Scripture speaks about this often even in the New Testament. Look over at Proverbs chapter 1. Proverbs chapter 1 verse 7. This is actually an essential element of the fear of the Lord, which we so recently studied. The fear of the Lord, it says in Proverbs chapter 1 verse 7, is the beginning of knowledge. Fools despise wisdom and instruction.\nYou want to be able to identify a fool? It's someone who gets angry when he's corrected, someone who lashes out when spiritual accountability is brought to his or her life. Proverbs chapter 10 verse 17 states it in the positive and the negative. Verse 17, he is on the path of life who heeds instruction, but he who ignores reproof goes astray. And this is fundamental to the entire Bible, beloved. If you'll look over at 2 Timothy chapter 3, let me show you something significant from 2 Timothy chapter 3 verses 16 and 17.\n2 Timothy chapter 3 verses 16 and 17, such a familiar text. All Scripture is inspired by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for training in righteousness. Beloved, part of biblical instruction and part of the purpose of God giving us the Scripture is to teach us in the right ways of doctrine and of godly living, but it's not just that. Scripture is given to reprove us when we go astray, to correct us. In other words, what you're doing is wrong, here is the right way to live, here is the right thing to believe, so that it trains us to walk in righteousness. Fundamental, essential to Scripture in a signature text about the authority of the Bible, the apostle writing under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit tells us why God gave us the Bible. And it is not only to teach us, but to reprove us and correct us morally so that we would grow in sanctification. And sometimes that correction comes through reading Scripture itself, but it also occurs, beloved, in the body of Christ, and it's one of the key responsibilities of elders to lead people and to exercise pastoral care and oversight in that way. It's worth expanding on this thought just a little bit.\nLook, I say this more often than I should probably. I've been in ministry for almost three decades now. There's a lot of history in a lot of places that cause me to say what I'm about to say. Outwardly, outwardly, the pattern in every church that I've been in is that people come and they say that they want Bible teaching, and they want fellowship, and it seems like that they are eager to embrace a biblical ministry, and they may even pay lip service to the importance of unity in the church. But the truth comes out when they resist accountability, when they reject reproof, when they refuse correction that comes to them through Scripture, through elders, through fellow believers in the body. This happens all the time, beloved, and it is a serious problem in the church of Jesus Christ. We need to recognize that Scripture is given in order to reprove and correct us, and the mark of one growing in godliness is one who, like David in Psalm 141, has the humility to say, I will receive the correction from the righteous.\nWho are you to question me is not words that come from the mouth of a sanctified heart. We're still in 2 Timothy 4, and for those that are in leadership, there's a grave responsibility to take these kinds of matters seriously. 2 Timothy 4 verse 1, after having just said what he said about the inspiration of Scripture, Paul tells Timothy in what are essentially his dying words biblically, he looks at Timothy as he's handing the spiritual baton to the next generation. As he's handing the baton, his apostolic ministry is coming to an end.\nTimothy will not be an apostle. He just has to build on biblical principles, and he receives the baton from the hand of the apostle Paul, and this is not a lighthearted event. Paul says, I solemnly charge you in the presence of God and of Christ Jesus, who is to judge the living and the dead, and by his appearing in his kingdom preach the word.\nBe ready in season and out of season. In other words, at all times. And what is the minister of the word of God? What does Paul tell this minister of the word of God to do with it? He says, You reprove, you rebuke, you exhort with great patience and instruction. He says, Timothy, it's vital that you do this. The advance of the kingdom depends upon you doing this.\nWhy? Verse three, For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine, but wanting to have their ears tickled, they will accumulate for themselves teachers in accordance to their own desires, and will turn away their ears from the truth and will turn aside the myths. Timothy rebuked them, reproved them, exhort them. There is a biblical responsibility upon spiritual leadership to exercise that function among the people of God. Now, scripture balances that, tells us in 1 Peter 5 that leaders are not to lord it over the flock, but there is a difference between lording it over and just abandoning the responsibility altogether. And so we have a responsibility as believers that we see illustrated in the life of David to receive correction as part of living the godly life. With that said, go back to Psalm 141. David, how does David describe that kind of rebuke coming to him? Well, remember, he wants to be sanctified.\nThat's at the core of what he's saying here. God, I want to be a holy person. I want to be godly. And so anything that contributes to my godliness is something that I welcome, even if it's when someone is confronting me. And so he says, it's like oil upon the head.\nDon't let my head refuse it, for still my prayer is against their wicked deeds. He says this rebuke is like oil upon my head. In the day, that oil would have had healing power. It would have had restorative power. It was medicinal. It improved. You know, when a head wound was treated with oil, it had a healing function. It smoothed it over.\nIt softened the wound and aided the restoration of the flesh. What David is saying is that in my desire for godliness, this kind of rebuke that encourages me in the direction of righteousness, it has a healing effect on me. I realize that the Lord is at work sanctifying me, and he embraces it. And while the rebuke might initially sting, David says, Lord, don't let me reject it. Don't let me harden my heart.\nDon't let me be a fool who despises instruction. Don't let me be like that, O God, because at the heart of it, I want to be sanctified. And so his commitment is to reject wicked deeds of any sort.\nYou see it there at the end of verse 5. Still my prayer is against their wicked deeds. I don't want their wicked deeds to invade my life.\nI don't want their ungodly attitudes to take root in my own heart. So, Lord, whatever it takes, whatever it takes to cultivate that in me, that's what I'm asking you to do. Send it through your word.\nSend it through a messenger to me. Send it through providential circumstances. Whatever it takes, Father, I want to be on the path of righteousness.\nSo it's kind of a close personal question to ask yourself, isn't it? Is that what I want? Is that what I... Do I somehow pray for that?\nIs that a trademark of the way that I... the way that I submit myself to the Lord? Make me godly? Not make me prosperous. Not make it easy. Not... not make it easy.\nNot take away the thorn. You know, Paul prayed that way three times, and the Lord said, My grace is sufficient for you. Paul said, Okay, then I'm well content with weaknesses and insults. As long as your grace is with me, that's what I want. And so David has explored and prayed thoroughly about his own sanctification. And that's really important to remember when we go to this third and final point for this evening. As he turns...\nIt's actually the third point out of four. We see in the next section a poignant prayer for justice. A poignant prayer for justice. David is about to pray in another, you know, in another strong fashion against his enemies. Understand that you must read these following verses in light of the humble cry for sanctification that he had just made. At the same time as we move into verse six, the psalm at this point becomes much more difficult to interpret. You read verse six and we find this. He says, Their judges are thrown down by the sides of the rock, and they hear my words, for they are pleasant. As when one plows and breaks open the earth, our bones have been scattered at the mouth of Sheol.\nIt doesn't have to do with anything that was going on beforehand. On this verse and those that follow, the 19th century commentator J.J. Stewart Perrone says this. He says this verse, difficult in itself, but still more difficult because it has no very obvious connection either with what proceeds or with what follows.\nThe illusions are so obscure that it is impossible to do more than guess at the meaning. In other words, he wrote a commentary, it's like this on the psalms. He comes to this passage and he scratches his head, and I don't know what this means.\nNow, he goes on and gives some suggestions along with other commentators, and so we can't be dogmatic in what we're about to say here. But if you remember a context that in these four surrounding psalms and even in this psalm itself, David is praying for help against his enemies. That guides us and shines some light on the difficulty of the passage. It seems to me that in this passage, David is asking for a dramatic punishment against his ungodly enemies. Look at it there in verse 6.\nIt's an abrupt shift from his prayer for sanctification, admittedly, but in verse 6, remember the enemies are in the background and are prompting the urgent prayer. So that, he says there in verse 6, their judges are thrown down by the sides of the rock. It's like he says, throw them over a cliff.\nThrow them over a cliff. And there's biblical warrant for thinking about that kind of imagery. It's what Jesus' enemies wanted to do to him in Luke chapter 4.\nThey wanted to throw him over a cliff. And you'll find a similar judgment taking place in 2 Chronicles chapter 25. Actually, let's look at it.\nWe have just a moment here. 2 Chronicles chapter 25, just to point this out to you. Now this is in a passage that comes after David. 2 Chronicles chapter 25 verse 12. The sons of Judah also captured 10,000 alive and brought them to the top of the cliff and threw them down from the top of the cliff so that they were all dashed to pieces. They exercised judgment against their enemies and they, you know, in the course of war this was the way that they destroyed those particular enemies. It was a judgment on those people that they were thrown over the cliff.\nAnd so David's words here in Psalm 141 verse 6 seem to be in a kind of a prophetic way and preparing the way for the judgment of his enemies. God, let the time come when they are thrown over a cliff. Let their judgment come. Let the wickedness that they are doing be stopped as in a manner consistent with them being thrown over the side of a cliff.\nThat seems to me to be the best understanding of it. And he says, they hear my words. My words are pleasant. His words are pleasant because they are true and they're pleasant in the sight of God. What David is saying about his enemies are true. His words are pleasant and therefore, God, come to my aid.\nKeep me and judge them. So in verse 7 he gives the reason for the judgment if to follow this train of thought. He says, as when one plows and breaks open the earth, our bones have been scattered at the mouth of Sheol. What he's saying here is that in the past, before my prayer, these enemies had inflicted carnage upon the people of God.\nAnd so he says, God, our bones have been scattered. They've inflicted destruction upon us and they've done so in a wicked way. So I ask you, God, to boomerang the justice on them. Deliver me and judge them and protect your people in the process. Let the judgment be thorough upon them. And that seems to be a good way to understand this most difficult text.\nWe'll come to our fourth and final point here. If you're taking notes, you can write this, this is a closing prayer of trust, a closing prayer of trust. David, having briefly considered his enemies and asking for God's action against them, he comes full circle once again and quiets his soul and returns to his trust in God.\nLook at verses 8 and 9. He says, for my eyes are toward you, O God the Lord. In you I take refuge. Do not leave me defenseless.\nWhen he says my eyes are toward you, he's expressing his faith and his dependence upon God. I'm looking up to you. I don't have the ability to help myself here. And so I look to you and I dependently wait on you to help me. God, you have the power to protect me.\nI'm asking you to use that power to keep me safe. And so he expands in verse 9 and he says, keep me from the jaws of the trap which they have set for me and from the snares of those who do iniquity. He says, God, the wicked have many ways to endanger me and to cause me to stumble.\nThey've set multiple traps in order to catch me in their plots. And so what he's saying here is, God, I'm asking you to guide me safely through them all. There's just such a tender spirit to this psalm, isn't there? As he asks God in a humble way, come and help me. As he humbly asks God to work in his heart and to guard his lips, God, I want to be a godly man in the midst of this. There's the flash of judgment against the enemies, but he comes back and he, you know, this is a man that's a king.\nDavid was a king and a warrior. And he entrusts his heart in such a humble way, saying, God, I'm just looking to you for my help. He's done with self-reliance and asks the Lord to provide for him. And the deliverance will show that God has been on David's side. Look at verse 10 as he concludes this psalm. He says, let the wicked fall into their own nets while I pass by safely. Once again, you see the principle of boomerang justice. He says, God, they are wickedly planning to cause me harm.\nLet it fall on them. Reminds me of Haman in the book of Esther. They built up the big gallows to hang Mordecai on.\nHaman ended up being the one that was hanged, and Mordecai was promoted to a place of prominence. That's what God does in his providence. That's how God protects his people. And that deliverance shows that God is with his people to help them, even in their times of danger. As we close, you know, and we contemplate everything that David has said and what we've seen here, let's close by turning to the book of Hebrews, chapter 4, and to just bring the spirit of Christ to bear upon it and the blessing that is ours to see that the becoming of Christ has broadened and deepened the foundation of the confidence that we have when we seek the Lord in our times of trouble and distress. Hebrews, chapter 4, verse 14, reflecting on the work of Christ on Calvary, the fact that he's ascended into heaven where he intercedes for us at the right hand of God. We have a brother in heaven who intercedes for us continually at the right hand of God, a brother who loved us enough to lay down his life for us. That's the precious intimacy that we have with the Lord Jesus Christ, one who is glad to be our great high priest and paid the price to do it. Verse 14, Therefore, since we have a great high priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus, the Son of God, let us hold fast our confession. For we do not have a high priest who cannot sympathize with our weaknesses, but one who has been tempted in all things as we are, yet without sin.\nHere are the words that I would leave you with as we close tonight, brothers and sisters. Therefore, let us draw near with confidence to the throne of grace, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need. Let's pray together. Father, surely we live in a world that assaults us, that causes us difficulty both within and from without. We come in this evening and ask you, Father, at the throne of grace, in the name of our Lord Jesus who purchased access to you and your holy presence for us, in the name of our great high priest, in the name of our brother in heaven, in the name of our Lord, in the name of our Savior, in the mighty name of Jesus Christ, Father, I ask for each one here, each one with a different kind of need for sure, but each one feeling the need in relationships or other matters of earthly concern. Father, some struggling mightily with temptation and brought to the point of almost complete discouragement because it seems like the sin is so difficult to overcome and tender hearts crushed under the weight of the disappointment and the shame that they feel in it, Father. For each one like that, Father, in the room and outside it, we pray and draw near with confidence that you will hear our prayer and that you will grant this promised mercy and help each one to find the grace that they need in their time of respective need. We ask these things in the name of our Lord Jesus.\nAmen. Well, friend, thank you for joining us on Through the Psalms.

{"id": "3828", "text": "Diversity & Inclusion ‘A Must For Tech Leaders’: UnTapped Tech Breakfast Features Vancouver Changemakers\nJUNE 26, VANCOUVER—For Lilian Umurungi, Human Resources Specialist at Capcom Studio, there is a simple reason for diversity in the workplace: “It’s less boring.”\nUmurungi was one of four panelists at the UnTapped Tech Breakfast organized by Open Door Group last Thursday, where employers and community leaders gathered to hear about diversity and inclusion initiatives in the technology sector. She was joined by Briana Sim, co-founder and COO of Radical I/O; Christin Wiedemann, Chief Scientist and co-CEO at Professional Quality Assurance Ltd.; and Gary Birch, Executive Director of the Neil Squire Society.\nAlthough diversity helps a business’ bottom line, the panelists were passionate about diversity and inclusion work for other reasons. “It’s about creating a community of shared values,” said Sims, whose company has reached gender parity. For Birch, who has been in a wheelchair since age 17, it’s about “making a fuss” and advocating for oneself so that others may also benefit.\nFor a company wanting to diversify their workplace, recruitment practices are a crucial place to start. “Words matter,” said Wiedemann, and both Sims and Birch also advocated for replacing long requirement lists with more friendly, open wording. At Capcom, Umurungi explained that they run job postings through an app that looks for gender neutral language.\nBeyond written postings, job interviews must also be reimagined. “Look for the potential in the ability of a person,” said Birch. Likewise, Sims looks for life experience in an interview along with certifications. Umurungi allows anyone interested to tour Capcom’s work space and meet employees before an interview to ensure a fit on both ends. The composition of an interview panel can also impact diversity, and Wiedemann reminded the audience that unconscious bias can affect people hiring others similar to themselves. “Homogeneity keeps us within boxes,” she said.\nEmployers may improve diversity through better hiring, but inclusion is an ongoing, active process. As Wiedemann put it: “Diversity is being invited to the party—inclusion is being asked to dance.” Asking employees to dance, so to speak, means a reflection on workplace culture. “[It’s a myth] that there aren’t qualified women for tech jobs,” said Sims, but not a myth that tech workplaces are male-dominated and often exclusionary for women. Wiedemann constantly asks employees with barriers what they need, recognizing that situations can change daily and that certain barriers are invisible. “The genius in the room is…the person who asks the questions,” said Umurungi.\nAccommodations for employees with barriers do take extra effort, but technology can help. “[It] allows people to define their own work environment,” said Wiedemann. Panelists spoke of technology facilitating more flexibility for women with young children and supporting employees with physical disabilities. Further, an employer committed to an inclusive workplace will likely have employees that are committed long-term, said Birch—grateful for the opportunity to work after years of struggling to find the right fit.\nAlthough leaders in the field, the UnTapped panelists also shared mistakes they’d made throughout their careers. “I wish I was less nice,” said Wiedemann, explaining that people will always come up for excuses regarding why they can’t do diversity and inclusion work. For Sims and Umurungi, connecting sooner with others doing similar work would have expanded their networks and increased support. This solidifies the importance of the UnTapped Series as one such network.\nWe respectfully acknowledge the work of Open Door Group & Untapped Awards takes place across British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, and Ontario — the homelands of over 500 distinct Indigenous nations and cultures.

{"id": "3839", "text": "Kerry Popko was hoping to end her high school rodeo career with clean runs at the National High School Rodeo Association national finals July 20-26 in Farmington, New Mexico.\nWhile she was successful in not knocking down any poles during the first Pole Bending go-round, her final high school rodeo ride saw Popko herself end up on the ground after her horse stumbled in deep dirt.\n“It wasn’t the way I wanted to end it,” Popko said.\nAlthough Popko did not place in the primary competition, the California team won the NHSRA volleyball tournament and Popko was selected as the most valuable player.\nPopko also took home a $500 scholarship from the national organization, giving her three high school rodeo scholarships for the academic year and five total youth rodeo scholarships.\nThe cowboys and cowgirls who place in the top four at the state level in each event earn a berth to the NHSRA national finals. Popko, who was a senior at Fallbrook High School during the California High School Rodeo Association District 8 season, finished third in the CHSRA state finals June 17-22 in Bishop.\nThe top five finishers in the district point standings for each event are invited to the state finals, and Popko had finished fourth in the District 8 Pole Bending standings.\nThe trip to the NHSRA national finals was the second for Popko, who also earned a trip to the national finals in 2006 as a sophomore. Popko and her 16-year-old horse, Banjo, began the 2008 national finals with a run of 20.669 seconds. “It was a nice run. It wasn’t just a clean run. It was fast,” Popko said.\nPopko’s first run July 20 was also the first Pole Bending run of the national finals. Her lead held briefly and she settled for seventh in the performance and 28th among the 173 pole benders who had times in the first go-round.\nDestri Devenport, who lived in Bonsall from 1998 to 2003, had a time of 20.410 seconds on her first Pole Bending run to take 17th in the go-round and third for the July 22 morning performance.\nThe competitors are split into six performances for each go-round, and the mirror format meant that Popko did not run again until July 26, giving Popko and Banjo five days between runs.\n“He didn’t get to move around a lot,” Popko said.\nPopko made occasional 6 a.m. practice rides during those five days, but Popko and Banjo couldn’t prepare for the deep ruts in the dirt they encountered at the July 26 performance. The dirt was dragged after every ten riders, and since Popko was the final rider she was the tenth after the drag.\nBanjo tripped as they were approaching the first pole. “He tried to save himself after he tripped,” Popko said. “It threw everything off.”\nPopko initially was worried about more than the stumble. “His knee got extended, and I thought he was hurt,” she said.\nPopko knew she wasn’t going to complete her run and prepared to dismount. “My foot got stuck,” she said.\nThe dismount didn’t go as planned. “I gracefully hit the ground,” she said.\n“I didn’t even feel like getting back on the horse,” Popko said. “It was a long walk back to the gate.”\nPopko had never previously fallen off her horse. “It happens to everybody,” she said.\nPopko’s lack of a time in the second go-round placed her 161st in the average among 178 contestants with times for at least one run. She was third among the 20 contestants with only one time.\nDevenport hit a pole in the July 24 evening go-round to incur a five-second penalty. She placed 86th in the average.\nThe national finals includes a volleyball tournament with teams from each state. For the first time in the tournament’s history, California took home the championship. “We always lose in the first round,” said Popko.\nThe two-day tournament saw California play three matches July 22 and five matches July 23. The matches involved a best-of-three format with games being played to 11 points during the initial rounds and to 15 points during the quarterfinals, semifinals, and finals. The matches were played on a grass court.\nPopko’s father, Gene, served as California’s coach. “I just gave suggestions,” he said.\nGene Popko had previously won championships as the boys volleyball coach at Inglewood High School. For the past twoyears he has been an assistant coach for the Escondido Adventist Academy boys team. Kerry Popko played volleyball for Fallbrook High School.\nThe 5’6” Popko was a defensive specialist on the Fallbrook High School volleyball team and during her club career, although the California team at the NHSRA tournament didn’t have official positions. Popko was positioned in the back row for the NHSRA tournament. “I cleaned up being the defense and the server,” she said.\nCalifornia lost no matches and only two games during the tournament. One of those losses was a 15-1 defeat in the first game of the semifinals against North Dakota, after which the Californians learned to hit the ball to the boys rather than the girls on the Peace Garden State team. California won the final two games against North Dakota and then swept Nebraska in the finals.\n“It was really cool to win,” Popko said.\nThe California players and Coach Popko received pins for their championship. Ariat donated certificates for belts and Wrangler provided the players with jeans.\nPopko was selected as the tournament’s most valuable player by the team parents.\nPopko was one of eight California competitors to receive a $500 scholarship.\n“I’m really happy for it. It’s really going to help me get where I’m going,” she said.\nThe national scholarship application process included a biography, a 100-word essay, and an interview with two out-of-state judges. Popko had previously received a $1,000 scholarship during the CHSRA state finals, a $500 merit scholarship from District 8 at the district awards banquet, and a $750 Zak Family Ranch Scholarship at the California Junior Rodeo Association banquet in January. The CJRA banquet also included $300 scholarships to each year-end event champion, giving Popko that amount from her 2007 Pole Bending championship.\nPopko had also written essays for her previous three championship-independent scholarships, and those essays focused on her relationship with her horse and her accomplishments in rodeo. The essay for the NHSRA scholarships addressed how the scholarship would make an effect on the recipient, and Popko once again utilized her horse in the essay, noting that reduced tuition expenses would translate into more money for feed and for gas to make the weekend trips to see Banjo. “It would help me and my horse come together, and I could spend more time with him,” she said.\nPopko will be attending California State University Long Beach and will major in communications. She plans to pursue a career in communications or public relations.\nWhile the top four finishers in the state qualify for the national finals, those who finish fifth through tenth are invited to the Silver State championships in Nevada. Popko competed at Silver State in 2007 as well as at the NHSRA finals in 2006 and 2008. Popko had been an English rider and had participated in equitation, pleasure, and hunter/jumper competition before her seven years in Junior Rodeo and four years of high school rodeo. Popko served as the 2006-07 CHSRA District 8 queen and was the 2007-08 District 8 student vice-president.\nPopko’s Fallbrook High School extracurricular activities included serving as the school’s Associated Student Body public relations commissioner for 2007-08, leadership in the school’s Link Crew which helps incoming freshmen and in the Breaking Down the Walls program, and participation in the school’s Invisible Children chapter.

Kazimierz Laski, one of the survivors from Poland who is arriving from Austria, will be present, along with family and friends of the survivors and the rescuers. Zofia Wroblewska-WieWiorowska’s and Albertus and Margaretha Haverkort’s children will receive the awards on behalf of their late parents, from Chairman of the Yad Vashem Council Professor Szewach Weiss.\nThe ceremony will take place in the Garden of the Righteous at Yad Vashem.\nFrom the Fall of 1940 until September 1942, Anna Wolfowicz and her daughter Irena lived in the house of Anna’s father, Dr. Tendler in the Ghetto of Zelechov, which is near Garvolin in Poland. In September 1942, at the time of the liquidation of the Zelechov Ghetto, the grandfather was murdered and Anna and Irena fled to Warsaw and found a hiding place in a Women’s Shelter with the aid of a school friend of Anna’s - Zofia Wroblewska-WieWiorowska from Czestochowa who worked at the shelter.\nZofia hid Anna and her daughter in the Women’s Shelter for two years and also helped Kazimierz Laski, Irena’s boyfriend - and eventual husband - to acquire forged Aryan papers and a hiding place in their basement in Warsaw.\nIn the Fall of 1944, with the start of the Warsaw Uprising, the Shelter was closed and Anna was moved to a forced Labor camp, and managed to survive the war. Her daughter Irena remained in Warsaw and was saved due to her forged papers. Kazimierz Laski, was wounded in the battle of Warsaw when he fought in the Ludova Army, yet he survived the war. According to his testimony, Zofia also helped other Jews.\nAlbertus and Margaretha Haverkort\nAlbertus and Margaretha Haverkort lived in the city of Sassenheim in the center of Holland. Albertus, who was a member of the local underground movement in Holland helped Jews in many ways including finding hiding places for them, and also hid six Jews in his family’s house and looked after their needs. In June 1943 Albertus was arrested for his underground activities and taken to the Vught concentration camp where he was tortured and killed in August 1944. Of the six Jews whom he hid, only three have been identified: Jo Karp, who stayed there until Albertus’ arrest, and Ida and Abraham Faerber who hid there until the end of the war.\nRecently, the Haverkorts’ son Henk found a Certificate of Appreciation from Keren Kayemet L’Israel in his parents’ house which was awarded for a tree that was planted in the Land of Israel immediately after the war in the name of Albertus Haverkort by Abraham Faerber - dedicated to “the help that the Haverkorts provided in those dark days of the Nazi occupation.” Henk decided to try to locate the Faerber family, and with the help of Mrs. Ruth de Jong, placed an ad in the newspaper of the Dutch community in Israel. Alice Lieberman-Faerber, the daughter of Abraham and Ida Faerber read the advertisement and contacted the Haverkort family.\nMore information about the Righteous Among the Nations program >>>", "scores": {"score": 3, "score_transform_1": 5, "score_transform_2": 5, "score_transform_3": 0}}
{"id": "3899", "text": "According to the Washington Post, the on-line cost of hiring a hacker to break into someone’s e mail accounts is now down to $30. And hackers have an almost 100% success rate. But the majority of the buyers from these hackers are actually boyfriends, girlfriends, or spouses. The point is, that for your on-line banking, or anything on-line, you need a better password than most people have! Because the most common password is still 1234 and that’s nuts.\nWhen is a deal actually a deal when we’re financing huge amounts of money? Here, and in the U.S., I keep seeing ads for houses and lots that are supposed to be incredible deals at 50% off. Off what? I’ve seen these ads in Ontario, and for resorts in BC. Lots that were originally listed at $500,000 are now half price. But that’s a phony figure, because the original price of the lots are just made up, and hoping that someone will pay it. What matters is what the house or the lot is appraised at TODAY, not what it’s listed for. Whether you’re selling your home, your car, or anything else, it’s the TODAY value, no what it was somewhere in the past! Careful with that, and don’t get trapped in the hype of an advertisement.\nKelly Blue Book just published their 2010 list of vehicles with their retained value and depreciation: Less than HALF of all new vehicles this year are projected to be worth 20% or more after five years. That is a staggering figure. The brands that will best hold their values:\nNumber one is Lexus, followed by Toyota (and that’s not accurate anymore with their current problems) and Honda. The only European brand in the top tier of vehicles that hold their resale value is BMW, which is fourth, and Subaru rounds up the top five.\nOverall, the average vehicle will be worth 32% of new vehicle price in five years. So remember that the longer you keep the vehicle, the less it matters. But the shorter buying cycle, or anyone fleasing…I mean leasing the vehicle, the more you will feel some real financial pain of paying for the depreciation.\nHave you heard of the Visa Black credit card? Well, they just sent me an invite. It’s a great looking, high quality, wedding-type invitation. But inside, it’s just another credit card application with great marketing.

Isn’t it the yummiest way to break your fast?\nMelons are now mostly available round the year.

Warning sign is the dark yellow urine which indicates that you are lacking in the liquid intake and need to increase the amount of water and fruit juices from the iftar time till Sehri. We have for you some fruit juice treats and a few delicious drinks recipes to keep you going this Ramadan. Diabetic patients or people suffering from any other health issues must consult their doctors before opting for sweets and juices. Keeping a balance in everything is important to stay healthy and fit.\nCool sweet soothing mango juice which can be made in no time. Prepare the mango puree and freeze it for later use in Ramadan. This can save your time for ibaadat and provide you with a mango chiller in no time just before Iftar.\nTake good sweet ripe mangos. Peel them and dice into small pieces which are easy to blend. Pour in some water, sugar if needed and mango chunks in the blender. The puree is now ready which can be mixed with crushed ice and some chill water when you need to serve your juice.\nIf you want to freeze your puree for a couple of days and prepare a refreshing mango squash or a mango cooler, we have another recipe for you.\nYou need 3 medium sized mangos diced in small chunks to be added in a saucepan with about 500 ml of water. Bring to boil and when it starts boiling cover the lid of the saucepan while turning down the heat. On low heat let the mangoes simmer for about half an hour and check with a fork if the mango chunks are soft enough. If the mangoes turn soft before the stated time you may take the saucepan off the heat.\nNow blend the liquid with the chunks in a blender after it cools down a bit. Add 1 small pinch of salt as a taste enhancer and sugar according to your taste while blending. Strain the juice to remove the concentrated puree and leftovers if any. Refrigerate and serve chill. You may add water according to the desired consistency.\nRefreshing lemonade can easily be prepared without any hassle. You can prepare lemonade in the afternoon and refrigerate it for a cool drink at Iftar. It helps in controlling blood pressure and is said to be one of the best solutions of dehydration.\nPreparing lemonade is very simple. You just need to blend water, lemon juice and sugar with crushed ice and serve with some mint leaves as a garnish.\nGoing out for a walk at night in Ramadan or have planned an outing at night? Try coconut water instead of a fizzy drink which will cool your system and re-hydrates your body. It also helps in making your immune system strong in summers.\nWe are lucky to have watermelons available throughout the year now. This fruit is a great source of vitamins and has a great cooling effect. Watermelon helps in protection from cold and provides energy. It is a good way to stay hydrated and is easy to prepare. Watermelon juices are said to be the most summer friendly drink. If you have the Apple juice machine in your kitchen then watermelon juice is a 5 minute job for you. Just cut your watermelon removing the hard green covering and squeeze the chunks in the machine. Here you go! The juice is on its way to make your iftar special. You may add tiny frozen watermelon chunks in the juice just before serving. Another idea is to pour some watermelon juice in an ice tray and let it form ice cubes. Add these watermelon ice cubes in the juice to beat the heat.\nYou can also prepare the juice in a blender. For that you need to cut the watermelon chunks and remove its seeds. Now add them in the blender with some sugar or honey and blend well will crush ice.\nYou may also prepare cucumber juice, peach juice, pineapple juice and carrot juice to keep you hydrated and cool in Ramadan. Avoid drinks with caffeine as the withdrawal symptoms while you are fasting may cause headache. Caffeine drinks in Sehri may make you feel thirsty soon. So this Ramadan, try to add more fruits and juices in your diet and learn how fruits and juices can benefit in Ramadan.", "scores": {"score": 3, "score_transform_1": 5, "score_transform_2": 5, "score_transform_3": 0}}

{"id": "3972", "text": "RECENTLY I had just delivered a pile of The Light newspapers to a shopkeeper, ‘Janet’, who displays them on her counter for customers to take, when an elderly woman came in. As soon as she caught sight of the papers she erupted in sheer fury. ‘What on earth are you doing promoting that awful paper?’ she demanded of Janet. ‘It’s nothing but conspiracy theories! It says that the vaccine is killing people! It is dangerous in the extreme. It’s evil and vile and makes out that governments are bad and are knowingly harming people.’ She uttered much else besides and with each exhortation she worked herself up further into a sorry state. ‘I’ll never set foot in this shop again,’ were her parting words as she stomped out.\nJanet, somewhat shell-shocked at this outpouring, didn’t say a word in reply. She had previously told me that one or two customers had said they didn’t like the paper (to which she had replied: ‘Well, you don’t need to read it, then’) but it didn’t take long for her monthly batch to be taken by enthusiastic readers. She had never seen this customer before and had never encountered this level of hostility.\nI made an instant decision to leave the shop and catch up with the woman, as I could see she was distressed. In my most sympathetic and concerned demeanour (genuinely felt) I asked if she was ok. She began to regale me with the same vitriolic invective she had been using in the shop. Over the years I’ve learned that the only way to deal with people who are so hyped up is to let them vent their feelings, be patient and not be in any way argumentative or confrontational. Letting people talk themselves out is the only way they will calm down and then, perhaps, you can converse with them on an even keel.\nAfter some minutes she was beginning to settle down. She asked me if I had read The Light and if I had what did I think of it. I’ve been in similar positions before and have gradually realised that rather than an absolute defence of the paper and presenting a counter-argument, a more subtle and thoughtful response is always more productive.\n‘I have seen this paper before,’ I replied, ‘and yes, it definitely does present alternative views to the mainstream. My own opinion is that “truth” is a slippery business in the modern world and I don’t know whether we can expect the truth from any source. Do you think we get the truth from the mainstream media?’ Her reply to this was interesting: ‘There’s no doubt the media exaggerate and mislead us to some extent.’ She told me about her position as a local politician, her involvement in the decisions made over the last four years and how it hadn’t been easy. I realised why she had been so upset.\nNow we were getting on to common ground. Job losses, businesses closing, the choice between heat and eat, constant wars and fearmongering, the insecurity and anxiety of modern life, particularly for the young, NHS waiting lists, technology leaving millions behind and much else besides. I suggested that in view of the aforementioned it might not be a surprise that more people were prepared to consider ‘conspiracy theories’ as their lives had been so seriously impacted, while those who were super-wealthy seemed to benefit more and more. She certainly didn’t disagree with this. I must have chatted to her for 15 minutes and we were certainly on the same page regarding most things.\nI brought the conversation to a conclusion and we parted with a handshake. My softly, softly approach may have planted a seed: who knows? But it is, in my opinion, the only way of dealing with people who cannot comprehend an alternative to that in which they have been indoctrinated.\nAs TCW has reported, on December 4, Andrew Bridgen co-ordinated and chaired a presentation at Portcullis House: ‘An address by doctors and scientists regarding the Covid pandemic and its consequences’.\nSixteen MPs attended and most seemed genuinely startled to hear the facts as presented. How, Ian Paisley asked, would MPs such as he manage public fear once his constituents were made aware of the truth imparted to them?\nHow indeed? And is it now the case that most MPs are simply too afraid to contemplate the truth, fearing the repercussions when the public finally find out the extent of the harms they have been subjected to?\nThe woman I spoke to had been instrumental in the enforcement of covid policies. However, she impressed me with her decency and her sincere belief that what she was doing was right. This is what I mean when I say ‘good people do bad things’. They do it out of ignorance and a lack of basic research, possibly because they have been systematised for so long.\nPerhaps this goes some way to explain the anger shown by this woman when seeing the newspaper. Maybe deep down her conscience was pricked and the revelation of what might be true was too much for her. When the truth is established, there will be an awful lot of soul-searching and I do believe there will be very many people who will find it extremely difficult, if not impossible, to come to terms with their actions over the covid years. Many of us will need to be compassionate, understanding and forgiving, but considering the harms done, particularly if we have been directly affected, will we be up to the task?", "scores": {"score": 0, "score_transform_1": 0, "score_transform_2": 0, "score_transform_3": 1}}

{"id": "4012", "text": "Riding a motorcycle is certainly an exhilarating experience. It’s almost as if you’re flying through the air at top speeds, knowing that no one can catch you. You’re all alone with the road, and your thoughts, and for some people, it’s as if you’re having a spiritual experience. If you’ve just started to ride bikes, and you don’t feel like this about riding whatsoever, don’t worry, you will soon. Riding a motorcycle can seem tricky when you first get on one, but with these tips, you’ll feel like you’re flying with the best of them.\nBeginners Guide to Motorcycle Riding\nFirst Things First\nThe most important thing to remember when you get on your bike is to strap on your helmet. You may think that all motorcycle helmets for sale on the market are good to use.\nHelmets don’t look too cool, even though there are some pretty wicked ones out there, but they can truly make a difference between life and death. So make sure you’re wearing your helmet, or you might have to worry about something other than looking cool, such as having your brains smeared all over the concrete. Now let’s get to the fun stuff!\nLearning to Turn and Lean\nWhile you’re riding a motorcycle it’s important that you understand how the turning works. The faster you’re going, the more you, and your motorcycle, need to lean into the turn. It’s also important for you to understand that different bikes lean differently. For example, sports bikes make sharper turns, so you have to lean into them more. If you’re a bit nervous about leaning into a turn, then perhaps you should consider taking a class for motorcycle riders.\nIf you want an easy technique for going through turns, which you most definitely do, it’s important for you to smooth out the radius of the turn. This means not making extreme changes in the turn, and making sure that you keep a steady radius throughout the first half of the turn.\nKeep this in mind: you want to approach most turns from the outside, with the bike on the inner side. As the turn ends, you’ll want to gradually widen your track.\nDo NOT Brake on a Turn\nBraking hard during a turn can cause you to crash your motorcycle. It’s better to just go with a slower speed, until you get used to how your bike rides, and how you should properly take turns.\nBe a Defensive Driver\nAs you already know, riding a motorcycle can be extremely dangerous, especially if you’re not paying attention to your surroundings. Watching the other vehicles around you will prepare you for any dangers lurking around the corner. A lot of cars simply don’t pay attention to motorcyclists, so you have to pay enough attention for everyone. Just be mindful about your surroundings at all times, and you could prevent a major accident from happening.\nChoose the Right Clothing\nWhen it is time to talk about the clothing for riding motorcycle, jacket comes first. In order to be effective, that motorcycle apparel should come with a CE safety rating. You want it in the elbows, shoulders, and back. Some jackets also fit chest protectors to protect your ribs, heart and lungs – again, look for that CE rating.\nFollow the Two-Second Rule\nThis rule refers to the amount of distance you should be behind other drivers on the road. This means that your bike requires two seconds to catch up with the other vehicles. If you’re closer than two seconds away, you need to back off a little bit. If a car in front of you stops short, then you and your bike are going to be in the back of their vehicle.\nKeep Your Heels In\nIf you ride a sports bike, you’ll notice that there are small diamond-shaped metal plates. Use these! Putting your feet on these plates can give you better control and more stability while riding. All you need to do is move your feet closer to the bike, until your heel is pressed up against the plate. You’ll see the difference in your riding immediately! Also Motorcycle exhausts system should be up to date.\nTight on Bottom, Loose on Top\nThis means that you want your legs and thighs to grip the bike. This will help you stay on the bike if you accidentally ramp a hill going 70 mph. You also want to keep the top half of your body nice and loose at all times. This will give you better control of your handlebars if you start to lose control in a turn.\nKeep Your Visor Closed\nIf you’ve already ridden a motorcycle before, then you know how uncomfortable it can be to have a bug fly into your face at 80 mph.

{"id": "4128", "text": "Heading south on Highway 99 out of Vancouver, Canada in a faithful, but beat-up old Ford Ranger during an extra cold January day, I asked a couple of questions that scared me, but were formational for my journey into pastoral ministry:\n“Where am I weak? Where do I need to grow?”\nI was heading back from sitting in on a couple of Michael Goheen’s classes at Regent Seminary with my pastor, who was completing his MDiv. My official title was “Executive Assistant,” but if you know me and my organizational skills you would laugh. The title should have been, “guy who is trying to figure out how to be a pastor,” but since that’s not very official sounding, I was an EA.\nTheologically Astute and Blind Spots Galore\nSee, ever since I got saved in my early 20’s, I was always pretty theologically inclined. I enjoyed learning about God, his attributes, and his ways. I had thrown myself into study within the first month or so of meeting Jesus and felt pretty well rounded in my understanding and my abilities to apply theology in a pastoral setting. Youthful confidence or pride would be a good way to sum it up.\nAnyway, I knew I had blind spots. I knew there was no way I was ready to enter pastoral ministry until I had a trusted friend, pastor, and guide to challenge me in my growth. So I asked, “Where am I weak? Where do I need to grow?”\nIf you are an aspiring pastor, new pastor, or young pastor you need to ask these questions too.\nFind a Trusted Guide\nI was blessed to have a pastor who cared about me, not just as a project to get another church planted or another pastoral candidate into ministry, but one who truly cared about me, invited me into his family, and spoke into my life at every level.\nI trusted my pastor not to misuse my desire for guidance to push his will into my life or affirm me in ways that wouldn’t have been helpful, but to speak lovingly and truthfully into my soul.\nIf you are growing, you’ve got to find a trusted guide to do that for you also. Seek them out, pray to the Lord to provide them for you, and develop a relationship that enables you to trust in their guidance. It will serve you well.\nDo What They Tell You\nThis should go without saying, but once you find that trusted guide and ask your questions, you need to be diligent about doing what they tell you.\nIt might seem overwhelming to begin with, but that should be a sign of good advice. If you are truly weak in an area, it’s going to be overwhelming when you think about growing there. It will be challenging, but that’s a good thing. Commit yourself to that growth.\nHaving the integrity to commit yourself to follow the advice of your guide is a good mark of character that will see you, not just through this time of growth, but future times as well.\nAsk Again Every New Season\nIf I’ve learned much in the past eight years or so since I first asked those questions it’s this: with each new season of life and ministry there are new areas that are revealed to me about where I need to grow. Make a practice of it. You aren’t likely going to identify all of your weaknesses and growth areas, so keep asking, keep growing, and keep developing as a follower of Jesus and ministry leader.\nYour congregation and those that you lead, or will eventually lead, will be blessed by it.", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

{"id": "4220", "text": "Questions About UNH, Answered by an Admissions Officer\nThis article was written based on the information and opinions presented by Karoline Goulart and Aja Altenhof in a CollegeVine livestream. You can watch the full livestream for more info.\n- What Were Some of Your Favorite Moments at UNH?\n- Are There Any Fun Campus Traditions at UNH?\n- Can You Talk About Some of the Clubs at UNH?\n- What Are the First-Year Dorms Like?\n- Can You Clarify the World Language Requirement at UNH?\n- Do You Have Any Advice for Students Interested in UNH?\nIn this article, we will be sharing some students’ questions about the University of New Hampshire (UNH), and the answers provided by Karoline Goulart, Associate Director of Admissions at the school and a UNH alumni.\nWhat Were Some of Your Favorite Moments at UNH?\nWhen asked about her favorite moments at UNH, Karoline shared several experiences that particularly impacted her. According to Karoline, many of her favorite memories related to the day-to-day happenings of being a college student and being able to live in the same building as some of your closest friends.\nAcclimating to College\nKaroline shared that as a first-generation college student, she did not know what to expect about the college experience or how to make friends. While this was stressful in the beginning, she remembered that in her first week at school, UNH hosted a variety of different socials where students had the opportunity to meet in the lobbies of their dorms and participate in different activities.\nAt one of these socials, she, along with other students, painted bricks meant to be used as doorstops to encourage them to keep their doors open and to meet new people. She remarks that this was a “really fun, low key way of meeting people.”\nBeyond these initial experiences at UNH, Karoline shared that she appreciated the long lasting friendships that she created at school. From having ice-cream movie nights in the dorms, or making plans to eat together in the dining hall throughout the week, these moments with friends at UNH are what Karoline misses the most about being on campus.\nAre There Any Fun Campus Traditions at UNH?\nOften, prospective students are curious about campus traditions at UNH. When asked about these traditions, Karoline shared several fun events that she experienced during her time on campus.\nWhen students first move into campus, UNH hosts “Wildcat Days” which is essentially a large carnival for students. At Wildcat Days, students can participate in different fun activities like getting a massage, bouncing in a bouncy house, listening to live music, going to a comedy show, and eating snacks like fresh popcorn.\nDuring the first week of school, UNH holds an event called “University Day,” which is a big, community-wide barbecue. At this event, the school shuts down both ends of Main Street, and lines it with different food vendors. Students can have everything from burgers and wraps to french fries, ice cream, and cotton candy. Additionally, each UNH student organization has a table where they give out swag items and encourage students to join their organization. This event is a fun tradition and an awesome way to visually see all of the different ways in which you can get involved at UNH.\nFinals Week Traditions\nUNH has several traditions associated with finals week. Before finals week, they host a late-night pancake breakfast for students, where students head to the dining hall to share in a fun meal.\nDuring finals week, UNH has traditions to help students de-stress called “Frazzle-free Finals Week.” For this tradition, they have special activities in the library, like bringing in puppies for students to interact with, giving out cookies, or the “Primal Scream,” where students gather to all scream together and release stress.\nCan You Talk About Some of the Clubs at UNH?\nAt UNH, there are many clubs to choose from. When asked about her involvement at UNH, Karoline shared that the main club she participated in was Mosaico, UNH’s Latinx student organization. She joined during her sophomore year after seeing a small Brazilian flag on a flier in the UNH student center. It was important to Karoline to find a community that reflected her identity.\nBeing involved in Mosaico was a great opportunity for Karoline as she was able to hold a leadership position, becoming chair of the club for two years. Through that experience, she coordinated various cultural events for the campus community, like Brazilian Carnival Night, the Latin Heritage Luncheon, and workshops. Additionally, through Moasico Karoline met friends from around the world and learned about different cultures.\nIn addition, Karoline worked for the Office of Multicultural Student Affairs and coordinated the events for them. She was also part of some campus Christian organizations and participated in residence hall activities.\nWhat Are the First-Year Dorms Like?\nMany students are curious about first-year dorm options at UNH. Karoline suggests that you first consider the following questions: “Who are you and what’s the easiest way that you make friends? Where do you feel most comfortable?”\nFirst-Year Residence Halls\nAt UNH, students have the option of living in residence halls where all residents are first-year students, and most of these are larger halls. These residence halls tend to be better spaces for students who like busy places. Karoline lived in one of these residence halls during her first year, and found that it was a good place for her to get used to what the university was like and familiar with different resources on campus.\nSmaller Halls and Themed Housing\nIf you don’t want to live in a first year only hall, you can choose a smaller hall or a themed residence hall. Smaller halls in particular are good for students who prefer quiet communities and smaller places. Themed residence halls are good options for students who find it easier to make friends with people who share common interests.\nAt UNH, every residence hall, no matter what type, will always have other first year students living there. What is most important to consider when exploring first-year housing options is what setting you’re most comfortable in.\nCan You Clarify the World Language Requirement at UNH?\nWhen asked about UNH’s world language requirement, Karoline shared details about this policy. At UNH, a world language is not required as long as students have 15 year-long units of core courses.\nFor example, if a student has four years of English, four years of math, and four years of science, they already have 12 units of core courses. After this they would only need to have three social science courses to meet the requirements.\nWhile two years of world language courses is generally the minimum for most universities. UNH is moving away from this because they know that many high school students have different interest areas and some high schools are removing their language classes.\nAdditionally, UNH considers the level of the language that you’ve taken. If, for example, you took level two-Spanish, then this counts for two years of world language.\nDo You Have Any Advice for Students Interested in UNH?\nMany students are interested in advice for the UNH application process. Karoline advises that students start the college process early because the college search can sometimes be overwhelming. Additionally, participating in activities like virtual information sessions are really helpful in narrowing down which schools will be a good fit.\nIf you can visit, Karoline highly encourages that you do this. Visiting campus can be a great way to get a sense of whether or not the campus feels like a place where you belong. When visiting campus, pay attention to the little things. Are the people friendly? Will they hold the door open for you? It’s the little things that really make a difference, and you can use those notes to narrow down your list.\nFinally Karoline shared that at the end of the day, no matter where you go, you will be successful as long as during your search, you use the resources available to identify schools that have opportunities you’re interested in.", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}

This follows the Society’s experts’ participation in panel discussions, arranged by the Science Council, at the three main political party conferences this season.\nLabour Party Conference\nDr Curtis Dobson, Director of the Medical Device Biology group and Enterprise Coordinator at University of Manchester, brought his first-hand experience of building a successful biotech business on the foundation of his basic neurobiology.\nThe twelve-year genesis of his first enterprise convinced Curtis that if we are to fully realise the social and economic potential of our research, our researchers need practical support and assistance in the complex task of translating the science and building a business. Even though subsequent spin-outs have been more rapid, indicating a better overall environment, the need remained his top priority for whoever is elected in 2015. As BBSRC Enterprise Champion for 2013 his is an important perspective. The macro statistics of the value of science to the economy and society is built of many such building blocks, each has to succeed to achieve the overall outcome.\nConservative Party Conference\nAt the Conservative Party Conference Professor Tim Dafforn, Entrepreneur-in-Residence for Synthetic Biology at the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS) and Professor of Biotechnology at University of Birmingham, also highlighted the need to provide practical support to researchers, where time and funding were key.\nHe said that resource is a major issue; the lack of time academics have to sufficiently develop the commercial aspects of new ideas, along with appropriate finance in the early stages of the commercialisation process was hindering the potential of future bio-technology spin outs. Tim also spoke of the need to work collaboratively to train researchers with entrepreneurial skills; since there is a lack of skilled entrepreneurs required to launch enterprises successfully from the knowledgebase. As an Entrepreneur-in-Residence, Tim aims to develop a fuller understanding of these challenges over the next 12 months. He will be discussing these issues with over 400 researchers, and learn from them how to formulate new strategies to catalyse the translation of life sciences research.\nLiberal Democrat Party Conference\nAt the Liberal Democrat meeting in Glasgow, we were represented by Professor John Coggins, Council Member of the Society of Biology and Emeritus Professor of Molecular Enzymology University of Glasgow. John has a special interest in knowledge transfer and in science education and communication.\nAt the meeting he championed the importance of funding for specialist training to fill crucial skills gaps in STEM. He highlighted the need for new models of capital investment in infrastructure and equipment that allowed the time necessary for returns, and that this may need to be incentivised. Alongside every high tech infrastructure-dependent project there are highly skilled people needed to run and maintain vital kit, and such expertise is in short supply and poorly encouraged. Procurement policies were raised here too and different models discussed including that of the US government.\nThe Science Council meeting series titled ‘Creating jobs and wealth from investment in science and innovation: ensuring everyone benefits’ brought diverse audiences and key MPs to each event and alongside the Society, the Royal Society of Chemistry, and the Institution of Chemical Engineers.", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

{"id": "4250", "text": "If you manage to get out of slavery — through escape or through emancipation; through the legislative or revolutionary end of the institution itself — what does your life look like?\nUnsurprisingly, the answer will depend heavily on circumstances. If you escape all the way back to a foreign homeland, you might re-enter normal life, albeit perhaps with physical and/or psychological scars. If you escape, but either can’t reach your foreign homeland or have none to offer you refuge from the society that enslaved you, then you might spend the rest of your life looking over your shoulder, wondering if agents of your former master will someday find you and drag you back.\nBut even being freed legally doesn’t necessarily mean you’re safe. In the U.S., where slavery was heavily racialized — much more so than in ancient forms of the practice — Black people prior to the abolition of slavery could be at risk of re-enslavement simply by dint of their appearance. Freedmen and freedwomen, or even Black people born free, were sometimes kidnapped and sold by racists who didn’t give a damn what their legal status was. The kidnapped individuals weren’t White; to the people perpetrating these crimes, that was justification enough.\nThis points at the importance not only of the legal framework around slavery in a given culture, but of the entire ideological basis underpinning it. Chattel slavery in the New World was ultimately predicated on a belief system that placed Europeans at the top, and all other races beneath them. We live with the legacy of that system today, in the form of White supremacy; it ensures that after individual emancipation, or even after the abolition of slavery as a whole, significant inequality remains. Anywhere that slave status is founded on a clear demarcation between the enslaving population and the enslaved one, and the assumption of innate inferiority on the part of the latter, you’re likely to see a similar dynamic.\nBut that’s not the only approach. While the Romans were hardly free of bigotry, their sense of supremacy was cultural more than it was racial: though it is often not depicted this way, Rome was a multi-ethnic society from the start, welded together through the adoption of shared customs and a web of legal rights. The magnitude of the difference can be seen in the fact that most Roman ex-slaves received citizenship — in a society where that status was emphatically not granted to every freeborn subject of the Republic or the Empire. Freedmen were barred from holding public office (though they could vote), but their descendants were not, and some even in the first generation amassed stupendous amounts of wealth.\nOf course, it wasn’t all sunshine and roses. Overly successful freedmen were sneered at as nouveau riche, and many elite Romans thought that slavery left behind a kind of moral taint that made freedmen less trustworthy. Even apart from that prejudice, a manumitted slave was expected to maintain a close — and distinctly subordinate — relationship with their former master: men became their political clients and supporters, and sometimes owed set amounts of labor, while unmarried women often wound up with their ex-master as their legal guardian . . . or as their husband.\nStill, it’s relevant that it was vastly more possible for freed Roman slaves to assimilate into regular society than those in the U.S. They were judged more on the basis of their behavior than their appearance: did they act like Romans? Reverting to native customs or showing up their supposed social betters attracted disapproval, but a hardworking and courteous individual who displayed the correct sort of piety could fit in pretty well. And although the first emperor, Augustus, passed laws to limit how many slaves could be freed at once and to bar their children from marrying into the senatorial class, there was never any attempt to wholly subjugate freedmen and keep their descendants in a menial state.\nSo for individuals, life after slavery could run a gamut from “you might be re-enslaved at any moment” to “this is actually a pathway to legal rights and financial success.” But what about mass instances? What happens when a whole population is freed at once, when slavery itself is overthrown through war or the passage of laws?\nAs I said in the previous essay, our examples here are extremely skewed towards recent history, because true abolition — not just exempting some people from slavery, not just morphing one form of unfree labor into another, but the absolute end of that practice — is largely a recent phenomenon. And because of that recent skew, we’re looking very much at Western colonial slavery, which tended to overwrite local practices with a big fat marker labeled RACE.\nWhich means that post-abolition society has rarely done a good job of anything resembling integration for ex-slaves. On the contrary, the U.S. promptly scrambled to maintain segregation and inequality any way it could, whether through interfering with Black participation in politics, economic maneuvers designed to impoverish Black families, cultural messaging that reinforces the lie of Black inferiority, outright violence, or other means. We’ve touched on these topics before, e.g. when discussing democracy and the right to vote; laws stripping that right from felons, coupled with an unjust justice system that preferentially targets Black citizens, are still staining our society a hundred and fifty years after slavery went away. The institution is gone, but the prejudice that held it up remains.\nI’m not aware of any counter-examples where slavery was built not on such profoundly racialized principles, and then was fully abolished. (A few Chinese emperors tried, but it didn’t stick.) As a result, we may not have any large-scale, real-world models for what the aftermath of that kind of abolition would look like — though if there’s one I’m missing, let me know! It would undoubtedly cause economic upheaval, just as in real history, since a great many slave-owners would be unprepared to pay wages to their former property, and might well look for ways to force those people into some kind of client status. But the ripples of that upheaval would, I suspect, pass far more rapidly. Even if slaves were branded or otherwise marked, their children would bear no visible sign of slave ancestry, making it far more difficult to impose social and political disabilities on them as a class. Not impossible — witness the difficulties faced by the descendants of “untouchable” castes in certain parts of Asia — but harder.\nIt’s an experiment I hope we never run outside of fiction.", "scores": {"score": 4, "score_transform_1": 5, "score_transform_2": 5, "score_transform_3": 0}}
{"id": "4254", "text": "Big update covering June, July & August – lots of pics and videos!\nIn early June 3M Open surprised Brax with an end of chemo party where they officially named her the 2021 3M Open Junior Ambassador. The party was held at TPC and included an amazing guest list of people who have played a critical role in her cancer journey. Brax could not stop smiling and was very much looking forward to the golf tournament at the end of July. #golfthatmatters\nSchool ended June 10th and that Sunday TB1F held the First Annual Putt Fore Patients at BMW of Minnetonka. This event was dreamed up by Brax since she did not think it was fair that only the parents could go to galas, etc. She created this family friendly event to help brighten the days for patients and families at Masonic Children’s Hospital. The event raised over $50,000 and is looking to be bigger and better in 2022.\nAfter all the hard work that went into Putt Fore Patients Brax was able to sneak away to Florida for a long weekend and relax. Her cousins were also there on vacation and the girls loved being able to spend time with Brooklyn & Landon. Brax & Bry were so excited to swim in the pool, go to the beach, and eat food from some of their favorite non-Minnesotan restaurants.\nOn a sad note we had to say goodbye to our family dog and everyone’s favorite family member Vinny at the end of June. When Brax was first diagnosed we made Vinny promise to not leave us until she finished her cancer treatment. He held up his end of the deal and then we had to let him go. We will always love and miss him – he was the best dog/fur baby.\nCarousel Motor Group and TB1F held a toy drive to kick off a 5 year commitment to the 5th Floor Toy closet at Masonic. Brax spent all of her time at Masonic on Floor 5 once she was diagnosed with cancer. Drive to Donate was a great success and is helping to further Brax’s mission of brightening the lives and providing distractions for the children at the hospital.\nAfter cancer and covid kept us apart Brax was finally able to see some of her family that lives in Arizona. We had a BBQ at our house and it was so great to see family, some of which we had not seen since Brax was diagnosed in early 2019.\nBrax and the entire family had the best week at the 2021 3M Open. Brax kicked off the tournament with a charity golf challenge that benefited Masonic Children’s Hospital with a check for $80,000. Brax and Bry had a full itinerary for the week and they loved every minute of it. Some of the highlights include touring the TaylorMade truck and having a custom driver made for her. Attending the “Share My Passion” Girls Golf Clinic with Annika Sorenstam and attending the Executive Women’s Day event. Brax was able to work with fellow ambassadors Kyle Rudolph & Josh Duhamel to highlight so many of the fun things that were going on at the 3M Open. Her favorite was the “Wrapped in Happiness” exhibit that featured artwork from Masonic patients on giant golf balls and tees. Brax and Bry were asked to color what makes them happy on the tee markers on Hole 13 and Brax also designed the pin flag on that hole as well. It is all part of the 3M Open’s partnership with Masonic children’s Hospital #golfthatmatters. Brax was even able to film a segment for the PGA at that hole (video below) and meet one of the pros playing in the tournament. The girls loved attending the Compass Celebrity Challenge and getting to meet the celebs on the green after the final hole – definitely a once in a lifetime experience. TB1F hosted patients and families at the tournament and the girls loved seeing friends and meeting new ones as well. Finally, they simply loved golf cart rides with many of the amazing staff members at 3MOpen.\nThe 2020 Tokyo Olympics would be exciting for any gymnast to watch but when you have a friend competing at the Olympics it is absolutely amazing. Twin City Twisters very own Grace McCallum competed for Team USA and brought home a Silver Olympic Medal. Kind, Humble, Olympian are just a few words to describe this amazing young women. We are so proud of our Amazing Grace!\nMeet Ranger Six and Riggins West the two newest additions to the Battaglia family. They have been keeping us all busy but it is so great to have a dog – two dogs – in the house again.\nAfter over a year long wait TB1F was finally able to host the 1st Annual Champion’s Cup. It truly was a “Night to Brighten Days” and everyone had a blast raising money for TB1F’s mission. We raised over $115K and are looking to expand on that next year – we can’t wait to hold this event again!\nUncle Tom and Auntie Laken were finally able to get married after a few Covid delays. The girls were both in the wedding and loved seeing family from both the Battaglia and Docter side.\nThe girls were honored to partner with CUB and star in a commercial that will help raise money for the University of Minnesota Masonic Children’s Hospital. The girls had a blast on set with Goldy and the amazing team they were able to work with.\nThe girls were both so thankful to be able to do normal kid stuff this summer. Tubing with their cousins in Duluth, Fast Track pool parties, hanging out with friends, and going to Bunker Beach were definitely some of the highlights. We are so thankful for the little things and being able to just be a normal kid once again.\nSeptember Updates coming soon! But check out a couple bits of info that we wanted to get out ASAP.\nWe did a limited release Childhood Awareness T-shirt again this year and we asked our good friend, neighbor and cancer warrior Bella to design this years shirt.

Below is an\nupdate and request for further action.\nAs you read this, 1,200 police in\nriot gear are descending upon Gangjeong village, the site of resistance to the\nUS/ROK naval base; 500 are from the mainland peninsula and 700 from Jeju.\nLast week, undercover police\narrested three leaders. They\nreleased village Chief Kang Dong Kyun, but Brother Song Kang Ho and Ko Kwon Il\nstill remain in prison along with peace activist Choi Sung-hee, who has been in\nprison since 19 May 2011\nThe villagers and activists say\nthat they are ready for nonviolent resistance, including the forceful removal of\ntheir bodies from Gangjeong village.\nThey are there to protect the land and defend the rights of the villagers\nto preserve their community and way of life.\nPlease, take three minutes and do\nthree simple actions:\n1. Contact Un General Secretary Ban\nKi Moon and let him know that he cannot ignore the grave human rights\nviolations taking place in his homeland against the villagers of Gangjeong\n2. Email the International\nSecretariat of Amnesty International and urge them to send human rights\nmonitors to Gangjeong Village immediately: https://www.amnesty.org/en/contact\nPlease forward this petition to\nfive friends and family. Four\nAmericans will be traveling to Gangjeong village on July 28 . That\nmorning, we will hold a press\nconference outside of the Blue House and deliver this petition to the\nKorean President Lee’s administration. We need to have 10,000\nsignatures. As of now, we have nearly 2,300. You can help us reach the\n10,000 signatories goal by\nThursday, July 28th. https://signon.org/sign/save-jeju-island-no-naval?source=s.em.cr&r_by=367997\nIf we want world peace, we must\ntake action together as a global community to save this island, an ecologically\nmajestic UNESCO world heritage site, from becoming a naval base that stages Aegis\ndestroyers in preparation for war.\nHere is an excerpt of a letter from Brother Song in prison:\nIf the Navy and government listened\nto local residents and proceeded with proper steps, the villagers would not\nhave fought against the naval base construction for five years. The Navy pushes the construction of the\nnaval base regardless of the destruction of the Gangjeong community. Not knowing the law, more than fifty\ninnocent farmers became law-breakers and were punished. More than 50 million won [Korean\ncurrency] has been paid in fines. And\nI also went to prison for the first time in my entire life. I was a cowardly young man, hiding\nmyself in the times of military dictatorship during the 1970s-1980s. For atonement, I served in places lie Aceh\n[an autonomous region under Indonesian rule], Haiti, and all kinds of conflict\nareas over the world. Now I am\ntrying to stop the insane construction of this naval base for the sake of the\njustice of our nation and the peace of Northeast Asia, as well as to keep the\npromise to the global society of preserving the ecosphere.\nPlease take action now. We must spring into action now.\nThe Global Campaign to Save Jeju", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

Earlier studies have shown that pastoralist mobility offers significant production advantages and enables pastoralist herds to access the best-quality grazing during the rainy season as they selectively target the new, more nutritious growth. Mobility also allows pastoralists to minimize time spent in difficult conditions (mud, flies, and overcrowding or overgrazing), while also maintaining dry season pasture and fodder reserves.

Some of the devices at risk of compromise are those that you might not immediately think about, including routers, network switches, and firewalls, all for the express purpose of stealing information, spying on your infrastructure, and infiltrating your network at their convenience. Therefore, you need to take measures to ensure that even your minor devices are secured.\nIn this case, it’s best to implement patches and security updates from the device developers.

{"id": "4420", "text": "This is a question our experts keep getting from time to time. Now, we have got the complete detailed explanation and answer for everyone, who is interested!\nCustomers can enjoy five delicious and festive holiday beverages this year including the Peppermint Mocha, Toasted White Chocolate Mocha, Caramel Brulee Latte, Chestnut Praline Latte, and Eggnog Latte. Starbucks confirmed to Delish that the Gingerbread Latte has been removed from the holiday menu in the United States.\nAt Starbucks, how do you place an order for a gingerbread latte?\n- Order a large Cinnamon Dolce Latte.\n- Include two doses of white mocha syrup in the mixture.\n- Add a pump of chai tea concentrate.\n- Request some nutmeg to be sprinkled in there as well.\n- You might ask for some nutmeg to be sprinkled on top for an extra kick of flavor.\nIn the year 2020, will Starbucks ever again offer the gingerbread latte?\nThe Gingerbread Latte was discontinued after the 2018 holiday season, and Starbucks has announced that it would not be sold in any of their stores in the United States in 2020. This is the second consecutive winter that this has happened.\nDoes Starbucks have gingerbread syrup?\nThe Gingerbread Syrup from Starbucks has just the right amount of flavor… The Gingerbread Syrup sold at Starbucks has an excellent flavor profile.\nHow much are Starbucks secret menu drinks?\n- Butterbeer Frappuccino: .89. …\n- Priced at .95, the Shamrock Shake Frappuccino…\n- Churro Frappuccino: .15. …\n- Ferrero Rocher Frappuccino: .95. …\n- Priced at .45, the French Toast Frappuccino is…\n- A Refresher on Valentine’s Day would set you back .45…\n- The price of a Dragon Drink is .15…\n- Pink Starburst Refresher: .45.\nA Barista Teaches You How To Make A Gingerbread Latte At Home, Just Like At Starbucks\nWe found 17 questions connected to this topic.\nWhere can I find the ingredients for a gingerbread latte at Starbucks?\n- Chestnut Praline Latte\n- Blonde Espresso.\n- Chestnut Praline Syrup.\n- Toffee Nut Syrup is the syrup.\n- Heavy Whipping Cream.\nThe absence of the gingerbread latte at Starbucks begs the question: why?\nBut, there was one beverage that was noticeably absent from the menu this year: the Gingerbread Latte. This is the second year in a row that this has occurred. Starbucks removed the well-known beverage from their menu before the previous holiday season so that they could place more of their attention on developing new beverages.\nWhat does Starbucks gingerbread Latte taste like?\nThe Gingerbread Latte tastes like Gingerbread.\nIn point of fact, it has the flavor of ginger and nutmeg. The ginger gave me a high.\nWhat kinds of seasonal beverages does Starbucks 2020 provide this year?\n- The holiday meal for 2020 features a greater number of successes than failures. I have spent the last ten months in a small town that boasts two restaurants. …\n- Eggnog Latte. …\n- Chestnut Praline Latte and Caramel Brulee Latte. …\n- Peppermint Mocha. …\n- Toasted White Mocha. …\n- Cranberry Bliss Bar®, as an added bonus\nHow many pumps of gingerbread syrup are there in a latte?\nFor a Tall, ask for one pump; for a Grande or Venti, ask for two pumps; and for an extremely sweet drink, ask for three pumps.\nIs Starbucks gingerbread Latte vegan?\nGingerbread Latte: The Gingerbread Latte will make a limited-time return, and for the first time ever, you’ll have the opportunity to order it in a vegan version. This offer is only valid for a short period of time. The distinctive espresso from Starbucks is combined with gingerbread syrup and steamed milk to create a beverage that is both sweet and delicately spicy.\nI’m curious about the calorie count of a gingerbread latte.\nThe Gingerbread Latte comes in at an impressive 260 calories and 11 grams of fat per serving. If you compare that to some of the more calorically dense items on the menu, such as the chichi Caramel Bruleé, which has 350 calories, and the milkshake-like Eggnog Latte, which has 360 calories, the figures speak for themselves.\nWhich holidays do Starbucks employees receive time and a half?\nThe holidays of New Year’s Day, Martin Luther King Jr. Day, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas Day are all holidays that Starbucks honors. Retail hourly partners receive a bonus payment equal to 112 times their regular hourly rate of pay for any hours performed throughout the course of these holidays.\nWhat is the most popular seasonal beverage sold at Starbucks?\nTo put it more succinctly, the chestnut praline latte is the best Christmas drink that Starbucks has ever produced. This beverage has a flavor that reminds one of Christmas. According to the description of the drink, a standard latte is transformed into a delicious treat by the addition of the flavors of “caramelized chestnuts and spices.”\nHow do you order holiday beverages that are good for you from Starbucks?\nYou can save between 80 and 110 calories by requesting either very little whipping cream or none at all; the exact number will depend on the size and flavor of your beverage. That is not a trivial amount. You may also request that your beverage be prepared “light” or “thin.” This basically essentially denotes that the beverage will be prepared with nonfat milk and will not contain any whipped cream at all.\nIs the eggnog latte at Starbucks a nice drink to get?\nIf you enjoy drinking eggnog on its own, you should give the latte a shot as well. Rich and creamy, it is made with steamed eggnog and espresso. Texturally, it is just like the eggnog you sipped as a child when opening stockings. However, flavor-wise, it is as if the steaming and heating of the eggnog strips it of its properties that are similar to melted ice cream.\nAre you able to recommend the gingerbread lattes?\nThe coffee flavor was barely detectable, despite the fact that it was still absurdly sweet. It tasted more like gingerbread spice hot chocolate than coffee. It was far more pleasant with whatever kind of topping that you could think of.\nIs Starbucks caramel brulee latte sweet?\nThis sweet latte did not live up to expectations… If anything, it has a little more smoky flavor than the standard Caramel Latte, which makes perfect sense given that brulée is the French word for burned. In the realm of baking, this term most commonly refers to the process of caramelizing sugar using a torch.\nDoes Starbucks drink Christmas?\nStarting on November 6, Starbucks locations in the United States and Canada will be decorated for the holiday season. This will coincide with the return of seasonal flavors such as Peppermint Mocha, Toasted White Chocolate Mocha, Caramel Brulée Latte, Chestnut Praline Latte, and Eggnog Latte. These flavors will be available in hot, iced, and Frappuccino blended beverages.\nWhat does gingerbread latte smell like?\nGingerbread Latte is a floral fruity gourmand fragrance for ladies that was created by the company Bath and Body Works. The Gingerbread Latte was first introduced in the year 2016. Gingerbread, pear ice cream, and orange peel make up the top notes. Milk, brown sugar, and vanilla make up the middle notes, and whipped cream, sandalwood, and musk make up the base notes.\nIs there a gingerbread latte available at Dunkin’ Donuts?\nThe Gingerbread Latte offered by Dunkin’ Donuts comes with a drizzle of caramel and may be purchased for the suggested retail price of .99 for a small, 10 ounce serving of hot beverage. A small (16 oz.) Iced Gingerbread Latte may be purchased for the suggested retail price of .49, and it comes topped with whipped cream and caramel drizzle. The size of the beverage is considered to be modest.\nIs it already the evening of Christmas Eve?\nThis means that your worker is eligible for “time and a half” pay for the hours worked that are in excess of 40 during the week of customary paid holidays such as Thanksgiving, Christmas, or Day 1 of the New Year. These holidays include Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Year’s Day. You are required by state law to pay your employee overtime for a period of two hours.\nDo Starbucks staff get free drinks?\nNo one at Starbucks has to worry about going hungry while they’re on the job. In addition to receiving one free item of food and multiple free drinks during each shift, team members are eligible to receive a discount of thirty percent off the price of food and drinks when they come in during their off days. In addition, during the holiday season, they are eligible for even better deals.\nWhich holidays need an extra hour of work?\n- New Year’s Day.\n- Sunday is Memorial Day.\n- Celebrated on July 4th.\n- The day of victory\n- The day of labor.\n- It’s Columbus Day!\n- Veterans’ Day.\n- Thanksgiving Day.\nHow can I order a slim gingerbread latte?\nGuiltless Gingerbread Latte\nWithout making any other adjustments, reducing the size of your beverage to an 8-ounce cup and ordering it “short” will immediately save you 150 calories. Don’t just leave it there. In order to save an additional 50 calories, ask the barista to omit the whipped cream from your drink and instead choose almond milk instead.", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

{"id": "4437", "text": "President Joe Biden officially announced he plans to seek reelection in an online video message that indicates he plans to wage a social issues-focused campaign that presents unrestricted abortion-on-demand and same-sex marriage as “our rights” to “personal freedom.”\nBiden chose to launch his reelection campaign, not with a traditional campaign speech, but with a previously recorded video posted online around 6 a.m. Tuesday morning. Abortion is among the ad’s first political messages, as the camera pans a protester holding a sign that reads, “Abortion is healthcare.”\nThe campaign video, which cites no presidential accomplishments in the president’s tenure, seemingly seeks to paint Republicans as extremists who threaten America’s spiritual health. “When I ran for president four years ago, I said we were in a battle for the soul of America. And we still are,” Biden says. “The question we’re facing is whether in the years ahead whether we have more freedom or less freedom, more rights or fewer rights.” But, the president asserts that “MAGA extremists are lining up to take on those bedrock freedoms,” including allegedly “dictating what health care decisions women can make, banning books, and telling people who they can love all while making it more difficult for you to be able to vote.”\nConservatives say the ad shows Biden’s newly discovered focus on social issues. “Five seconds. That’s how long it took Joe Biden to endorse abortion in his new campaign ad,” noted SBA Pro-life America. “It’s what he’s running on. It’s what he stands for: taxpayer funded abortion on demand up to birth.”\nBiden’s reference to “banning books” apparently refers to outraged parents’ efforts to remove books heavy with graphic depictions of sexual acts from public school libraries serving children under the age of 18. Among these titles is “Gender Queer: A Memoir” by Maia Kobabe, which “has detailed illustrations of a man having sex with a boy,” as well as “fellatio, sex toys, masturbation, and violent nudity.” Another book that frequently generates parental outrage, “Lawn Boy” by Jonathan Evison, “describes a fourth-grade boy performing oral sex on an adult male” and remembering the experience fondly. The content of books that parents removed from Florida school libraries proved so sexually explicit that TV networks cut away from a press conference in which Florida Governor Ron DeSantis (R) showed their contents publicly. One such concerned parent pushed back against such characterizations, telling “Washington Watch with Tony Perkins” last July that removing pornography from school libraries is “not Kristallnacht.”\nBiden’s campaign appears to have adopted the talking points offered last summer by a Beltway Democratic polling firm, Hart Research Associates, which advised Democrats to attack “Republicans’ culture war attacks on schools” and accuse the GOP of “banning books and censoring curriculums,” while reassuring voters that Democrats want to “put politics aside.”\nBiden’s launch video also appears to indicate that he will highlight his signature accomplishment of the so-called “Respect for Marriage” act, which imposed a nationwide redefinition of marriage on all 50 states. As he refers to “telling people who they can love,” the camera features Jim Obergefell, the plaintiff in the 2015 Supreme Court opinion that invented the right to same-sex marriage. Swing-state voters in Ohio rejected Obergefell in a landslide loss last November.\nThe ad says Biden intends to advance “personal freedom,” to “protect our rights,” and “to make sure that everyone in this country is treated equally.” As president, Joe Biden attempted to impose a COVID-19 vaccination mandate on every employer with 100 employees or more, doubled fines for travelers who refused to wear masks, and shoehorned discriminatory race- and gender-based equity policies into every aspect of government.\n“I know America,” Biden insists in the ad.\nBiden’s campaign intends to enroll inner-city Christians in his coalition. Near the end of the video, a shorter-than-normal screen cut featured two shots containing a cross-shaped Baptist church sign and a black minister opening his church door, separately.\nCritics showed no surprise that the president chose not to highlight his record, which has included inflation unseen in 40 years, a poorly executed withdrawal from Afghanistan, and divisive efforts to brand his political opponents as incipient domestic terrorists.\n“This particular president has been a sad story for the United States,” Rep. Dan Bishop (R-N.C.) told “Washington Watch with Tony Perkins” on Tuesday. “We’re exposed to so many weaknesses in consequence of it abroad.” The last 27 months have inflicted “debilitating damage,” Bishop stated.\nEntirely apolitical figures have criticized Biden’s promotion of gender ideology, threatening to cut off school lunch funding to schools that refuse to give men access to women’s private facilities and the “right” to compete against females in sports. “More and more women are realizing their biological reality is being attacked by politicians pandering to their base instead of protecting women’s rights,” said 12-time NCAA All-American swimmer Riley Gaines. “Protecting the girls’ and women’s sport category is common sense and should not be a partisan issue.”\nWhatever issues his handlers highlight, Joe Biden faces an uphill battle in 2024. Biden currently has an approval rating of just 39%, according to the latest Reuters/Ipsos poll. A new CBS News/YouGov poll shows that 72% of Americans say the nation is “out of control,” and 71% say it’s Joe Biden’s fault.\n“In terms of inflation and other problems in our economy, it’s time to turn a page,” Bishop told Perkins. “But he’ll do what he’s going to do, I guess.”\nA whopping 70% of Americans, including 51% of Democrats, say they do not want President Biden to seek a second term in office.

Now that the assessment has been in place for about five years, researchers worked to examine whether it is an effective tool for assessing aspiring teachers. They concluded that the results are not always reliable or precise, with potential negative impacts on teacher candidates. Until these issues are further analyzed and resolved, the researchers suggest that the edTPA should not be used for high-stakes decisions for individual teachers.\nWhy This Matters in Minnesota\nThe Professional Educator Licensing and Standards Board (PELSB) is currently undergoing rulemaking for teacher preparation unit and program regulations, which are the requirements all teacher preparation program providers must meet to prepare candidates for teacher licensure in Minnesota. One of the proposed regulations would keep the edTPA as the board-adopted teacher performance assessment required for licensure, as well as one of the measures for program effectiveness. Given the results of the study, PELSB should reconsider adopting the edTPA until the issues are further analyzed and resolved.Read the full report", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}

{"id": "4476", "text": "By Avalon Vowles, Second Year Theatre and Performance\nMost of the time, debut albums can be hit or miss; a substantial number of successful bands and artists have weak and meagre beginnings.\nI recognise that this is a topic subject to opinion, but I believe these albums paved the way for the future of their genres by originating a sound that was new, rousing, and revolutionary right from the get-go. We must acknowledge their humble origins. These artists did it right the first-time round.\nThe Velvet Underground and Nico - The Velvet Underground (1967)\nSurging with nihilistic and avant-garde commotion, The Velvet Underground’s 1967 debut album is arguably a fundamental influence on countless sub-genres in the rock and alternative scene: namely krautrock, punk, garage, and shoegaze.\nUnder the management of iconic pop-artist Andy Warhol, this hybrid art-rock album enthuses themes of sadomasochism, drug abuse and general experimental deviancy with mesmeric melodies and rhythms. Recorded with the primary formation of the band (Lou Reed, Sterling Morrison, John Cale, and Moe Tucker) and joined by German singer Nico, I honour the album for its tangled instrumentation, which is pleasurably accompanied by Reed’s dispassionate and relinquishing voice.\nIt speaks for the untamed sensibilities of New York City, and although it is noted for its controversial lyrics, a few of the songs provide a tender complement to its overarching umbrella of merciless concerns, such as 'Sunday Morning' or 'I’ll Be Your Mirror'. Aching with distortion, drones, and detuning, songs like 'Venus In Furs' and 'The Black Angel’s Death Song' will equally hypnotise and violate you, making it an intrinsic selection for my top five.\nGrace - Jeff Buckley (1994)\nGrace is not only the debut album of Jeff Buckley, but also his only full studio album. Wistful of failed relationships, desire, and loss, this harrowing 1997 album is eternally hungry and energetic.\nConcocted with ingredients of classical, jazz, grunge and so much more, the album rose considerably in critical reception after the early death of Buckley, with his tragic passing amplifying its emotional significance for listeners. Buckley’s soul-stirring lyrics, along with his four-octave vocal range, generate an evocative and tender intensity delightfully bathed in vibrato. Songs like 'Mojo Pin' and 'Grace' are distinguished by howling guitars which jangle their way through intricacy and complexity.\nThe opening harmonium chords on 'Lover, You Should’ve Come Over' were enough alone to warrant this album in my top five; Buckley passionately yearns his way through the song, lamenting on dying emotion and lost love. His atmospheric songs of lust and heartache will enchant you, as the album’s journey lulls you into drowsy relaxation before throwing you back into its exhilarating hubbub of noise. Better put in Buckley’s own lyrics from the song 'So Real', the album ‘sucked me in and pulled me under’.\nSongs of Leonard Cohen - Leonard Cohen (1967)\nAged 33 and already established as a Canadian novelist and poet, Leonard Cohen decided to venture into the occupation of music and thankfully got caught in the introspective web of New York City’s folk scene. Wrapped in a sensitive blanket of nostalgia and longing, Songs of Leonard Cohen was released in 1967 and is an immensely reflective and poetic debut album which explores life’s quarrels of romance, religion, politics, isolation, and loss.\nCohen masterfully plays the heartstrings on the guitar of the soul in songs like 'Suzanne' and 'So Long, Marianne' and narrates to the listener an acoustic story of woe in his gravelly baritone voice. Nancy Priddy furnishes a selection of the songs with haunting, feminine backing vocals which supplement Cohen harmoniously. It is notable to mention the range of instrumentation which colours the album, with added flute, mandolin, jaw harp, violin, and an assortment of Middle Eastern instruments.\nThis album compels you to doze in the evening sun and bask in its sentimental lyrical and musical beauty. It is an album which I believe probably has life’s answers hidden in its melodies.\n#1 Record - Big Star (1972)\nAlthough American rock band Big Star were only originally together for four years in the early 70s, their formative accumulation of work never ceases to inspire and influence preceding generations.\n#1 Record is a debut album enthused with the authentic essence of rock and roll and power pop, as the band tightly weave through robust and intoxicating riffs that establish their tough rhythmical sound. The record’s driving power is best heard in full, with each song congregating together to form a complete and seminal sound.\nThe ingenious duo of Chris Bell and Alex Chilton share the song writing credits equally, as they alternate vocals on each song, collectively showcasing a detailed and impressive thick bed of vocal harmonies. 'Thirteen' and 'Watch The Sunrise' serve as an innocent reminiscence of the fragility of youth, through tight harmonies and bright acoustic twelve strings, where songs like 'Feel' and 'The Ballad Of El Goodo' rapture into an upsurge of riffs, rhythms, and refrains. Emerging out of Memphis, Tennessee, but immortalising themselves as rock and roll revolutionaries, this album is a testament to classic rock and its ceaseless splendour.\nFive Leaves Left - Nick Drake (1969)\nEnrolled at the University of Cambridge and just 20 years old, Nick Drake met American producer Joe Boyd and consequently Five Leaves Left was the first product of their friendship.\nMoody, morose and melancholy, this album is an acoustic masterclass as Drake’s fingerstyle techniques sway gently on a riverbed of dense and rich strings. Encircled by an ensemble of instrumentalists, Drake recorded this album live along with the string section and that atmosphere resonates into the organic and sonorous final product.\nActing as a grievance of England’s doldrums, Drake’s lyrics are pensive and contemplative as he troubles over ephemeral happiness and ruminates in the dark corners of the mind. The numerical rhythm of the double bass and the precision picking of the acoustic guitar on 'Cello Song' entwine mythically with Drake’s velvety voice as the cello fluidly twirls in and out. Songs like 'River Man' will wash over you in a mediative wave.\nHis wickedly plaintive folk stands the test of time, as the album still feels fresh and pertinent. It is an album worth listening to loudly in headphones, and is well deserving to be in my top five.\nFeatured Image: Ozgu Ozden | Unsplash\nWhat's your favourite debut album?", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

{"id": "4541", "text": "For all us Floridians, there is no denying it – SUMMER IS HERE. The heat is already overwhelming, the insects are feasting, and the pool is as mainstream as the couch. In addition to adjusting to the change in weather ourselves, our pets are going through a period of adjustment too. I see an influx of “summer” emergencies starting now, and it can be stressful for us and for our pets. I’m a firm believer that summer pet safety is all about education and prevention. So I want to share my most commonly seen pet emergencies this time of year and how my pet parents can avoid trips to see me with 7 summer safety tips for dogs and cats.\n7 Summer Safety Tips for Dogs and Cats\n1. Heatstroke in Pets\nHeatstroke is by far the most upsetting summertime emergency I see. If not treated quickly enough, this devastating complication can result in death. Heatstroke is a condition caused by the body overheating, usually as a result of prolonged exposure to or physical exertion in high temperatures.\nImagine wearing a fur coat during the summer and sitting outside for an hour or so. That is what it is like for our pets. Make sure your pets have access to shade, water, and a cool area. Try to pick times of the day that are not so hot, such as the early morning or evening, for walks. Always carry a water bottle for your pet.\nIt is important to note that Brachycephalic breeds (dogs that have a flat and wide skull shape, such as bulldogs, pekingese, and pugs) and overweight dogs are more prone to heatstroke. Extra preventative measures should be taken for these dogs during hotter months.\n2. Cookouts and Food\nSummer is great for BBQs, and I certainly love hosting, but these cookouts can be harmful to our pets. I see a lot of upset stomachs during the summer because of table scraps and foods that guests give pets. Dogs and cats are used to eating the same food every day. Their gastrointestinal tracts develop a natural flora, or bacteria, that specifically digests their regular food. When they get something that they aren’t normally accustomed to, such as burgers or hot dogs, they can develop severe inflammation with vomiting and diarrhea. It can also lead to more serious conditions such as pancreatitis.\nIn addition to an upset belly, many foods in large quantities are toxic to our pets, such as grapes, onions, garlic, and raisins. Grapes and raisins are safe for cats, but keep onions and garlic away from them.\nSome cookout foods can also be a risk of choking or obstruction such as corn on the cob, fruits with pits, and foods with bones, toothpicks, or skewers. I have surgically removed all of these items from a pets’ intestines. Surgery can be very costly and stressful.\nMake sure to talk to any guests, especially kids, before summer parties. Remind them not to feed your pets any food. You want to enjoy the party, too, not spend it looking after a pet with an upset stomach.\n3. Hot Sidewalks and Pet Paws\nBlack pavement (or asphalt) can get very hot and can harm your pets’ paws. Avoid these areas during the hottest times of the day. Or ask your dog walker to keep your pet on the grass.\nAnother common injury I see is ripped or torn paw pads. Many times, dogs will run around excessively in circles on the pavement. This behavior causes torn paw pads. Check paw pads often for injury during the hot summer months.\nPools and lakes are great exercise and great fun for our pets. Keep in mind that not all dogs can swim. Some may not like water at all. Certain breeds, like pugs and terriers, often have trouble swimming. If your pet is not accustomed to swimming, watch them carefully when they are outside near the pool. I do see drowning emergencies at the hospital, which can be very scary.\nI will never forget when I was 7 months pregnant and my 140 pound Saint Bernard, Dory, fell into the intercoastal waterway. Dory does not swim well. My adrenaline took over, and I somehow hoisted her up onto the dock with no injuries for anyone involved. Since then, we have installed a baby gate that protects the kids and pets from the pool and intercoastal.\nIf your pets enjoys the water, use an ear cleaner with a drying agent after swimming. Ear infections are very common.\n5. Parasites, Bee Stings, and Snakes\nWe see ticks and fleas all year round in south Florida, but these pests are worse during the spring and summer seasons. I see more pets during the summer with bee stings and snake bites. Please refer to my blog on Springtime Pet Hazards for more information on these parasites and insects and how to protect your pet.\nMany dogs are terrified of the loud sounds of fireworks. These fears can present with mild signs like hiding or more severe signs like destruction, shaking, and harming themselves. I see many of my clients right before the Fourth of July for sedatives for their pets.\nIf your pet has a fear of fireworks, prepare as best you can. Take them to a place where the fireworks cannot be heard. If that is not an option, your veterinarian can prescribe medications for anxiety and fear.\nFor all of us Floridians, June officially kicks off hurricane season. Hurricanes are a very real and scary threat in Florida during the summer, and preparation is crucial. Make sure you:\n- Arrange for a safe haven for your pet in case of evacuation.\n- Have emergency supplies and travel kits ready.\n- Choose designated caregivers if you are unable to care for your pet during a hurricane.\n- Make sure your pet is microchipped.\nVisit the Red Cross for more information and details on preparing for hurricane season with your pets.\nI hope these summer safety tips for dogs and cats will keep your pets safe and healthy during the summer months. Summer is a time for water sports, cookouts, family, fun, and relaxation. Prepare as well as you can, and avoid these common pet emergencies. You will help keep summer fun and laid back for you and your pet!", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}

{"id": "4583", "text": "As people continue to prioritize their health and wellbeing, natural health supplements have become increasingly popular. From turmeric to black seed oil, many natural ingredients are believed to have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties that can benefit the body in various ways. One product that combines several of these natural ingredients is designed with True Liposomal Technology, which provides increased absorption, bioavailability, and intracellular delivery. This technology involves encapsulating the active ingredients in tiny spheres called liposomes, which can pass through cell membranes more easily and protect the contents from being broken down too early.\nLet’s take a closer look at the natural ingredients in this product and how liposomal technology may enhance their benefits.\nTurmeric Root Extract (Curcuma longa)\nTurmeric is a spice commonly used in Indian cuisine, and its active compound curcumin has been studied for its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. However, curcumin is not easily absorbed by the body and can be rapidly metabolized and eliminated. Liposomal technology may help improve the absorption of curcumin, allowing it to remain in the body for longer periods and potentially increasing its effectiveness.\nLuteolin is a flavonoid found in many plants, including celery, broccoli, and peppers. It has been studied for its potential to reduce inflammation and protect against oxidative stress. However, like other flavonoids, luteolin can be difficult for the body to absorb. The use of liposomes may help improve the bioavailability of luteolin, allowing it to be more easily absorbed and utilized by the body.\nNigella Sativa and Nigella Glandulifera (5% Thymoquinone)\nNigella Sativa and Nigella Glandulifera are two plants commonly used in traditional medicine. Both contain the active compound thymoquinone, which has been studied for its potential anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anti-cancer effects. However, thymoquinone is also poorly absorbed by the body. Liposomal technology may help improve the absorption of thymoquinone, allowing it to more effectively exert its potential health benefits.Shop now for ATLANOVA Liposomal Sleep Complex!\nIn summary, the combination of turmeric root extract, luteolin, and extracts from Nigella Sativa and Nigella Glandulifera may provide various potential health benefits. The use of liposomal technology may help enhance the effectiveness of these ingredients by improving their absorption and bioavailability. If you are interested in trying a natural health supplement, consider exploring products designed with liposomal technology for enhanced delivery.", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}

{"id": "4631", "text": "When you create a role and configure access permissions, you need to test your role settings to ensure that users in that role can see and do exactly what you want.\nYou can accomplish this in one of the following ways:\nTip: You can also test your app as a specific user.\nTo test as another role, you need to be one of the following:\nAn app manager\nIn a role with Admin or Admin, Sharing permissions\nIn a role with Basic, Sharing permission\nWhen test as a role, you see only what users in that role see in your app: including the app home page, the list of available reports, and the records and fields that users in that role can view and modify. When you test as a role, you use the app, so any changes that you make while testing are applied to the app. (When testing as a user, you can’t make changes to Quickbase data, like adding, editing, deleting, importing, or creating new tables. As a result, you may not be able to completely check a workflow when testing as another user.)\nException: If you belong to a Quickbase group with Admin; Admin, Sharing; or Basic, Sharing permissions, some of those permissions may be retained during the temporary role change. In this case, we recommend using one of the other ways listed above to test role settings.\nVarious aspects of Quickbase access controls can affect how temporarily changing to another role behaves:\nMultiple roles: If you belong to multiple roles and temporarily change your role, you belong to the temporary role only until you return to your former roles. For example, if you are in both Project Manager and Team Member roles in the application and temporarily change to a Viewer role, your only role in the application is Viewer while you test the application.\nNote: The Everyone on the Internet option is just a group within Quickbase; one that allows people who aren't signed in to Quickbase to view data in your apps. See the exception noted above if you are testing a role while part of a group with Admin, Sharing or Basic, Sharing permissions.\nTarget Group membership:A Target Group is set per user on the Manage Users page and specifies which group's records you can see or modify when you are in a role whose View Records and/or Modify Records table permission is set to Group's Records. If you change to a role in which a table's permissions are set to Group's Records, you will not be able to view or modify records in that table. If you set the Target Group for your user while in a temporary role, Quickbase does not support that action, and automatically returns you to your former role.\nTo test your app as a role or user\nClick the user drop-down. You can choose to test the app as \"A Role\" or \"A User.\"\nAfter you select a role or user to test as, you’ll see a message in the header and in the menu indicating that you are testing:\nClick End Test when you're finished testing.\nMobile web preview\nWhen testing as a user or role, you can check how the app appears in a browser on a mobile device.\nOn the right side of app pages, click the Mobile web preview icon:\nA panel appears where you can see how elements of the app, such as home pages, tables, and reports look on a mobile device. The preview changes as you navigate through testing the app.\nNote: Mobile preview is not currently available for use in Microsoft Internet Explorer.\nCreate a secondary user account, either by creating a new user profile or by registering for Quickbase with an alternate email address, like your Gmail or Hotmail account. Share the app with your alternate account in the role you want to test. Sign out and sign back in as your testing persona. Access the application and make sure you see what users in that role should see.\nAsk a few potential application users to test the application. Share your application with them in the role you want to test. Watch over their shoulders as they navigate your application. Make sure they see what you want them to see.\nAlso, take this opportunity to get feedback on your application. Do your testers find their tasks easy to accomplish? Does your setup make sense? Could you design the application differently to help them out? Use their feedback to make changes. The more people like your Quickbase application, the more likely they are to use it.\nGuide your users by annotating your data-entry forms with help popups that tell users how to enter information. Also, customize your app's Home page to include instructions and quick links to important features. You can even write a guide for your application. Let Quickbase help you compose an attractive web page and post a link to it on your application's Help panel.", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}

{"id": "4645", "text": "So in this book Nic Bishop, photographer extraordinaire, takes pictures of spiders and some of them even live with him and his wife. Yikes! He really is an incredibly talented nature photographer. Cari reviewed his book Nic Bishop Frogs and a new book about butterflies & moths will be coming out this spring.\nNote about spider pictures: We understand that many people are let’s say less than fond of spiders and might be a bit jumpy. So other than the book cover we won’t be putting other pictures of spiders, although we will put links to some pictures so for those of you who are brave, curious or click happy you can check them out.\nCari: One night I couldn’t sleep after getting up with my baby so I decided to go upstairs for a little while and when I went back down guess what I saw on the floor? A Black Widow Spider. Yikes!!!!! So I thought, “Great I have no shoes on if I try and get my husband up he will hear the panic in my voice and come running out and step on it.” So, me being a resourceful person I went upstairs and grabbed the first thing I could see that might work – an empty sour cream container. Which amazingly worked and of course it woke my husband up with all the pounding on the floor and he comes running out. I’m shaking and he says, “what are you doing?”\n“I just killed a black widow spider.” he looks down and sure enough belly up a nice red hour glass.\nSo of course I couldn’t sleep and went back upstairs and thought oh I’ll just do some blogging. The first blog I go to visit, had this book: Nic Bishop Spiders. It totally freaked me out. (Obviously I got over it enough to get it from the library).\nHolly: I liked the book. I really liked the blue tarantula . . . cobalt blue tarantula.\nCari: We liked that one too. Especially the one where it is molting.\nCari: Did you read it with your kids?\nHolly: Yes, we all read it together after I’d read it to my toddler several days in a row for nap time story- his choice. his favorite spider, again and again was the green lynx.\nCari: I wan’t going to read it to my daughter because I thought she would freak out from the pictures that are amazing and so realistic.\nHolly: I think it gave my youngest son chills. It gave me the chills.\nCari: My daughter saw the book and asked to read it. She said she liked the book and that there was a spider that reminded her of her dad. A little puzzled I asked her, “Really?”\n“Yeah, mom I want to find it.” She then turned to the page of the huntsman spider. Apparently, she heard it as the husband spider, and since it’s green and her dad likes green . . .\nHolly: I love the the things kids think of!\nCari: I liked that each page had some facts about the spiders.\nHolly: This is a Robert S. Sibert Award book. I remember what fascinated me is all the things he does to get the pictures and his wife even goes with him.\nCari: Yeah I’m not sure if my husband was in that line of work that I would be so willing to go with him. The pictures are freaky. It’s amazing so many different types of spiders in his book doing different things.\nHolly: I liked the wolf spider page a lot. I had one for a pet in second grade. I think it died because I didn’t catch enough flies.\nCari: Did she have babies?\nHolly: She died right after she had the babies and I got distracted. I kept her in a big white plastic peanut butter bucket. I really like the jumping spider fold out part.\nCari: Yeah me too.\nHolly: I loved that he photographed a spider in the act of molting.\nCari: Amazing how many different types of spiders there are and how large and small some of them are, but most large ones don’t live where I do. Thank goodness!\nAnd now for a trip down memory lane . . .\nCari: Remember when I had a dream that a spider was on your stomach and I saved your life by killing it with my bare hands?\nHolly: Very well . . . actually, all I remember is being awakened in the middle of the night and seeing this hand coming down. “Whack! Whack!” By the third hit my brain responded and my hand stopped yours midair. I’m pretty sure my stomach hurt the next day.\nCari: But weren’t you grateful I was willing to go to such lengths to save your life? It was a big spider, a tarantula size spider.\nHolly: Yeah, sure. . . but remember in real life, you weren’t even willing to kill the Black Widow outside your daughter’s room bare handed? You had to go get a sour cream container. Does that mean I’m more important than them?\nCari: Nope, sorry. I think it means I’m a grown up now and have greater powers of reasoning – especially when I’m awake.\nHolly: I’m not so sure about that. (chuckle, chuckle) Do you remember the spiders in our basement growing up?\nCari: Those things were creepy.\nHolly: Yep. I remember telling Mom and Dad that these spiders weren’t your ordinary spiders. If you saw one and left the room to go get a tissue, when you came back it would have disappeared. Completely.\nCari: Yeah, so then you started trying to trap them, so you could figure out what kind they were.\nHolly: I remember being so frustrated when everyone would tell me they were just common garden spiders. I mean, come on! I had a pet spider for like two whole weeks in second grade. Doesn’t that mean anything?!?\nCari: Ummm. No comment.\nHolly: (sigh) Thanks for the vote of confidence. So, anyway, I searched and searched with my specimens by my side, ready to compare. I never could find a match.\nCari: I left for college so I didn’t have to deal with them anymore. Except in the summers when I came home to work.\nHolly: Our brother (yes the blanket lover) would go fetch me jars when the spiders came running out. We trapped them and then I’d study them. I thought that maybe they were brown recluse spiders, but they never had a violin shape on the top. I finally gave up and went to college myself.\nTwo years go by . . .Cari and Holly are now roommates at college.\nHolly: Guess what! I picked up the school newspaper on the way home today and . . .\nCari: Anything good?\nHolly: Just this amazing article on the front page. Did I tell you I was right, or what?\nCari: (gasp) Those are the same spiders in Mom and Dad’s basement.\nHolly: Yep, they’re called hobo spiders and they are poisonous and practically blind, but they do sense vibration. That’s why they always disappeared when you walked away- they could sense. your. every. movement.\nCari: (shiver down the spine) What a comforting thought.\nHolly: So, I picked up extra copies to send to Mom and Dad. I can’t wait to tell them! I finally have proof!\nCari: I can’t wait to go home this summer and sleep with the spiders, that will be so fun! Not! (editorial note: once upon a time it was popular to say not after things you didn’t really mean)\nThe next summer . . .\nCari and Holly getting ready for bed, brushing their teeth, washing their faces, etc.\nCari: (ear piercing scream followed by a single bounding leap onto the countertop)”There’s a spider Holly! A spider!”\nHolly: (also jumping onto the counter) “Where? Where?”\nCari: (trembling and giggling) “Over there! Crawling towards the tub!”\nHolly: “Hey K! (our basement brother) bring me a jar!”\nK: “No way! I’m not coming in there- there’s a spider in there. A Hobo spider. I’ll stay right here in my room, in the very middle of my bed, thank you very much!”\nHolly: (muttering) “I’m not getting on the floor – those things have no vision! He might run right at me and he’s fast! Aha! The toilet plunger! Okay Cari, I’m going for the plunger” (can we say Owen and Captain Plunger here?).\nCari: “Good idea.”\nHolly: I’ve almost got it. Just another inch. “There! Okay, I’ve got the plunger, now I just have to trap the spider.”\nCari: “Just cover him with it, then we know where he is.”\nHolly: “Okay, done. Now what?”\nCari: “Let’s go get a piece of paper and slide it under like you do with the jars. Then we can shake him up and . . . we can’t drop him into a jar.”\nHolly: “Yeah, he’s probably hanging upside down in there with no intention of dropping anywhere.”\nCari: “Dang it. We can’t squish him in there either.”\nHolly: “At least we know where he is. But we can’t just leave him there.”\nCari: “Yeah, the little boys might try to play with the plunger. that would be dangerous.”\nHolly: “In more ways than one.”\nCari: “I can’t remember how this story ends. . .”\nHolly: “Me either.”\nCari: “I don’t want to be the heroine this time.”\nHolly: “Oh puhlease! Do I have to do all the dirty work?”\nCari: “Pretty much. I’m the oldest that makes me the boss.”\nHolly: “Could this be an indication of how the story ended? You probably sat on the counter and screamed while I went and got a shoe, and then shook the spider loose and smashed him to smitherines.”\nCari: “That’s sounds about accurate to me.”\nHolly: “We did learn some good tips for spiders that ended up coming in handy. At least for me. I got married the next year and always slept with slippers under my pillow so I could put them on without having to shake them out first. My first two years of married life were spent in spider infested basements. I once found a really big one- we’re talking 2 1/2 inches in diameter floating in the toilet when I turned around to flush.\nCari: Oh, spare us the details!\nHolly: Did I mention I’m a little nervous about spiders?\nCari: Why would you be nervous about them. I mean, come on! You had a pet spider back in second grade. (snicker)\nHolly: Yeah, well usually that’s enough to calm the tremors, but we just moved into Mom’s basement last week while we look for a house to buy.\nCari: The basement. Eww! Gross. Good luck! Say hi to the spiders for me!\nHolly: Thanks. I’ll be sure to send them your good wishes. I’ve sent 4 to a watery toilety grave so far- after squishing them of course. I don’t plan to make them suffer.

{"id": "4650", "text": "How to Make a Standpipe in a Spring Pond\nA standpipe is used to control the level of water in ponds. It serves as an adjustable drain, allowing the pond owner or manager to drain any water above a controllable level. By adding a sleeve---a larger pipe capped at the top end that fits over the standpipe---you can drain water from the bottom of the pond. Water will enter the assembly between the sleeve and the standpipe at the bottom and rise to the opening of the standpipe. When properly constructed, the standpipe can serve as an important management tool for a small pond.\nInstall a drainpipe from the deepest portion of the pond to the drainage area. Size the pipe to allow the pond to drain in an appropriate time. A small pond can drain in a day or two with a 4 inch pipe. Larger ponds can use pipes as large as 1 foot in diameter. Keep in mind that a large pipe may flood the drainage area. Spring fed ponds---ponds with natural flowing underground water sources---are continuously replenished and may require larger drainage pipes.\nAttach a 90 degree swivel fitting to the end of the drainpipe. Depending on the amount of mud in the bottom of the pond, it may be advisable to attach this fitting before placing the drainpipe. The swivel function of this fitting allows control of the water levels that will be drained.\nAttach the standpipe to the swivel fitting. The standpipe, when standing straight up, should be at least as high as the high water capacity of the pond. As the standpipe is pivoted on the swivel fitting, the top of the pipe drops to lower levels, allowing the pond to be drained to any desired level. Attach a rope or chain system to the standpipe to allow control of the standpipe position. Make sure this is secure; if the standpipe inadvertently falls down, the entire pond will drain.\nOptionally, fit a sleeve over the top of the standpipe. A sleeve is simply a pipe with a diameter larger than the standpipe that is capped at the top end. Water enters the standpipe assembly at the bottom between the standpipe and the sleeve and is forced up by water pressure then flows through the standpipe. This allows removal of water from the bottom of the pond, which is usually of poorer quality than water near the surface, and is useful when you are only partially draining the pond\n- A properly placed standpipe sets the maximum depth for the pond. In spring fed ponds, water may continuously drain through the standpipe. If you use a sleeve on the standpipe, the water will be removed from the bottom of the pond.\nKeith Allen, a 1979 graduate of Valley City State College, has worked at a variety of jobs including computer operator, medical clinic manager, radio talk show host and potato sorter.

Additionally, compressing images and using the correct file format can significantly improve page loading speed, which is another factor that search engines consider when ranking websites.\nFor videos, using a video sitemap and adding relevant keywords to the title and description can also boost your website’s SEO. Overall, optimizing images and videos is an essential aspect of on-page optimization that should not be overlooked.\nThe Importance of Optimizing Images\nWhen it comes to optimizing your website for search engines, images are often overlooked. However, they play a crucial role in your website’s organic ranking. Not only do images make your website visually appealing, but they also contribute to user engagement, which is an important factor in search engine algorithms.\nIn addition, optimizing your images can also improve your website’s load speed, which is another important ranking factor. A fast-loading website not only provides a better user experience but also signals to search engines that your website is high-quality and well-maintained.\nMoreover, with the rise of image and video search engines, such as Google Images and YouTube, optimizing your images and videos can also help you rank higher in these platforms and drive more organic traffic to your website.\nTips for Image Optimization\nImages play a crucial role in website optimization, as they are visually appealing and can make your content more engaging. However, they can also slow down your website’s loading speed, which can negatively impact your organic ranking. To optimize your images for SEO, here are some tips you should keep in mind:\n- Choose the right file format: The most commonly used image formats for websites are JPEG and PNG. JPEG is best for photographs, while PNG is better for graphics and images with transparent backgrounds.\n- Compress your images: Compressing your images reduces their file size without compromising on quality. This can significantly improve your website’s loading speed.\n- Use descriptive file names and alt text: Make sure to use relevant keywords in your image file names and alt text. This helps search engines understand what your image is about and improves your chances of ranking for those keywords.\n- Optimize image size: Images that are too large can slow down your website’s loading speed. Resize your images to the exact dimensions you need for your website.\nIn conclusion, optimizing your website’s images and videos is crucial for improving your organic ranking. By following these techniques, you can not only boost your website’s SEO performance but also provide a better user experience for your visitors. Remember to regularly review and update your images and videos to ensure they are still relevant and optimized for search engines. With these strategies, you can drive more organic traffic to your site and achieve better rankings in search engine results pages.", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}

{"id": "4735", "text": "As the saying goes – spring is just around the corner, and there’s something in the air that makes me want to get out my seed packages and a bag of soil and plant something!\nIn the 1980’s, when I started gardening, shopping for seeds and plants was not nearly as interesting as it is today. Tomato hybrids like Better Boy and Early Girl were at the height of popularity and there were usually only 5-6 varieties of tomato plants available at garden centres. The choices in other vegetables were even more limited. With a resurgence of interest in open-pollinated and heirloom vegetables, shopping for plants or seeds today is becoming so much more exciting! Tomatoes and most other vegetables come in every size, shape and colour, and the flavours are just as varied. Purple potatoes, watermelon radishes, lemon cucumbers?! The hardest thing is not going home with many more seeds or plants than you need.\nStill, we apparently have nowhere near the abundant choices that we once had. It’s estimated that over the last century, something like 90% of our seed biodiversity has been lost as large seed companies took over ownership of seed stocks and let unusual varieties dwindle in favour of the most popular commercial varieties. The National Geographic infographic below, illustrates the scope of the problem.\nTo get some insight into this issue, join us on Wednesday, February 27 at the TRU Alumni Theatre for a screening of SEED: The Untold Story. It’s a beautifully crafted and visually stunning documentary following some of the world’s most passionate and dedicated seed savers as they battle to preserve some unique and valuable seed varieties. It’s both an inspiring story and a call to action. Following the movie, we will have a panel discussion and Q&A with some local seed champions to help us learn what we can do to help save our remaining food biodiversity.

But it does mean that approaching with caution is a necessity.\nDon’t be concerned if most of the companies out there are too complex for you to understand comfortably. This is how it should be. If you cannot predict the next major fashion trend in women’s leisurewear or forecast the success of a drug pipeline for a biotechnology company, then these are not the sort of markets you should get involved in.\nAfter all, these sorts of complicated problems materially impact the earnings of a lot of the businesses in the market generally. When you come across a business like this, move on! There are far too many fish in the sea for you to get bogged down by one business.\nCan you get a grasp of the main industry drivers within 10 minutes and how the business makes money? If you can’t, the idea is not for you, and you need to move on to the next one. It doesn’t need to be mega difficult. The easier you can make it for yourself, the better.\nYou May Like to Read: A Practical Guide to Building Generational Wealth\nBuy Stock with the Plan to Hold onto It Forever\nAnother tip for high-net-worth investors is to purchase stock as if you are planning to hold onto it forever. If you’re not thinking about owning a stock for 20 years, you should not be contemplating the ownership of it for 20 minutes. If you have done the job correctly when purchasing common stock, there should never be the right time to sell.\nThis is a mindset and approach that is going to bring you a lot of success as an investor. The buy-and-hold mentality is effective because it is difficult to locate exceptional companies that continue to have a bright future in the long term.\nMoreover, quality companies increase their value over time and bring in high returns. When it comes to a wonderful business, time is only ever a friend. After all, fundamentals can take a lot of years to influence the price of a stock, and only investors who are patient are going to be rewarded.\nLast but not least, the enemy of investment returns is trading activity. If you are always purchasing and selling stocks, this is going to eat away at returns in the form of trading commissions and taxes.\nInstead, you are usually always going to be better off buying right and sitting tight. After all, the stock market has been created to transfer money from those who are active to those who are patient. It certainly pays to be a patient investor.\nLearn How to Determine News From The Noise\nThe final tip when it comes to investing is that most of the news out there is simply noise, not news. Every day, investors will have financial news hitting their inboxes. You can easily fall into the trap of being lured by the headlines and information. However, a good investor will brush off most of the news that falls into their inbox. This is because it’s usually noise, not news.\nWhen it comes to financial news, only around one percent of the financial news you consume should result in any sort of investment action. You then have 99 percent, which is simply conversations and headlines that are designed to generate buzz and trigger your emotions.\nRemember, financial news outlets are always looking to blow up issues. After all, this is how they remain in business. The stock market is manic-depressive! As an investor, you need to ask yourself whether a news item is really going to have an impact on the long-term earning power of the company in question. If the answer to this question is no, then you should probably do the opposite of whatever the market is doing.\nAs the stock market is a dynamic and unpredictable force, you need to learn how to be extremely selective about the news you choose to listen to. You need to be even more selective when it comes to the news you choose to act on.\nAs you can see, there are a number of advanced investment strategies that you can make the most of as a high-net-worth individual. We hope that the advice that has been provided in this blog post will help you to maximize the cash that is available to you. After all, it’s all well and good to have a lot of money, but you need to make sure that this money is working for you.\nYou May Like to Read: Know the Future Value of Your Investment", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

Up until that point, I had only seen the Rockies from a long distance because we lived within visual sight of them due to their sheer size.\nSurprisingly, up to that point I had only been as close as the foothills that were close to the Rockies, but paled by comparison to the big guys.\nThe experience of a family trip through the Rogers Pass portion of the Trans Canada Highway was a completely different experience because nothing quite prepares you for an up- close- and- personal- view of the Rockies.\nThat’s why I never got tired of that road and I have driven though the Canadian Rockies many times since that first trip as an eight year old. It is awe-inspiring any time of the year and it lacks only one component: I would love to do the trip in an old car, possibly even a 1960 Dodge.\nI rode through the Rockies as a young kid with my older sister Shona in a 1966 Plymouth Valiant during the Summer of Love in ’67 and I drove through the Rockies as a young adult in my brother’s TR6 during two summers of temporary love that took place in the early 80s.\nSandwiched in between those classic runs were several trips taken at different times of the year in my 1971 Duster.\nHowever a TR6 was a great way to make those journeys fun and the destination even more fun if one takes into account the shallow nature of holiday weekend free-for-alls in the Okanagan Sun Belt.\nSpontaneous reminiscing brings me back to the notion that I need to take the trip in an old car that was built in an era long before modern technology and creature comforts made the journey far too easy on the drivers and passengers.\nI want to push an old vehicle to the very edge of its comfort zone and headlong into a new experience on a highway that is a veritable roller-coaster ride through the king of the mountain ranges, the Rocky Mountains.\nThat’s why I want to test out how an old school power-train handles upward portion of the big hills and how an old school drum brake system handles the downward portion of the same big hills. I want to push my old car’s comfort zone with an ancient car cooling system that is tested by steep inclines and a car air-conditioning system that consists of an open vent window.\nEssentially I want to test the original equipment steering and suspension system on an old car against tight mountain curves and steep mountain passes. Hundreds of thousands of old cars have done the trip already over many decades since my first childhood Rocky Mountain car trip, but almost all of them have long since departed every road, let alone the mighty Rogers Pass.\nMost of them are simply part of somebody’s childhood memories, not unlike my own.\nHowever I want to re-visit that childhood moment in a very real and gut-wrenching way–less a carload of kids like my first trip through the Rockies.", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}

I have used kodi and plex but they get messy with trying to automatically catalogue shows and have a lot going on. I figured I could get the very essence of them distilled down as I don't really expect much from something like plex. I just want to be able to download shows and movies and play it on my phone at home.\nWith that very simple idea, I figured I'll make a site that serves mp4 as that is natively supported by all the browsers. The first version of the site took the form of just being a listing of directories with mp4s at the ends of them. It was cumbersome but it worked and I happily used it for quite some time.\nAfter almost a year, I decided to take a stab at making it look pretty! I also took this chance to learn css grid and flexbox properly which I think worked out great. I learned quite a bit and I'm still learning new things. So far I was able to get away with not even using media queries to get responsiveness thanks to the following article.\nOne of my initial ideas to make my plex clone was to use the file system as the source of truth. I was going to just query and transform all my downloaded files into a format that I could then use on the front end. This was not too much work as I recursed down the directories and built up an in memory database. This way the system would be as up to date as possible without me having to do anything.\nThis quickly got messy with way more code than I expected being written. There was probably an abstraction that I could have added that would have made this idea worthwhile but I quickly gave it up and went the traditional route of setting up a database that stored the metadata about each directory. The metadata is entered manually as I add shows and movies, I also download the posters and banners and update the descriptions. I also clean up the folders so that seasons are laid out how I want them to be. This is all very much extra steps but for now its fine. I don't download enough or have enough content that this is impossible.\nSwitching to using a database ended up being a good idea, it simplified the code drastically and a lot of the junk I had written could now be deleted. It's not news but databases are better than ad-hoc databases!\nI think there is a way to get around using a database as after all I rely on sequelize to do all the complex work and that's why I think the database is simple.

{"id": "4935", "text": "Chapter 1030: A Single Strike Reaps\nQin Yi intently observed Li Luo. Although the Other Li Lingjing was at the Lesser Heavenly Resonance Tier, it possessed strange abilities that multiplied the difficulty of dealing with it, so it was much more difficult to kill when compared to enemies of a similar level. If Li Luo wasn't able to kill it with a lightning-fast strike, it may very well transform back into mist, making it incredibly daunting to deal with.\nLi Luo appeared before the Other while Qin Yi watched nervously.\nAt this point, the Other also realized the dangerous situation it was in. It directly smashed the water replica to pieces with a single strike, then the face on the back of its head began to howl, murmuring some ambiguous words.\nThe effect of its enchanting voice was to throw off one's focus and addle the mind.\nHowever, a fiendish howl similarly echoed out from Li Luo's scarlet bracelet, breaking through the chant of doom.\nThe Other immediately began to retreat, and the pale visage on the back of her head opened its mouth. In the depths of the shadowy mouth were a pair of pasty, white hands that were forming a seal.\nWhite flame spewed out a moment later, and numerous faces with pained expressions could be seen within it. The faces began to devour each other at breakneck speed and very quickly merged into a pale, nine-fingered bone palm that burned with ghastly flame, directly facing off against the brunt of Li Luo's attack.\nLi Luo could sense the immense corruption contained within the palm. A normal Lesser Heavenly Resonance Tier cultivator would not dare to collide with it head-on.\nHowever, his gaze showed no hint of retreat, only turning more focused and icy.\n\"Unclean creature, I won't let you abuse Cousin Lingjing's image any longer.\"\nHe snorted lightly as he hacked downwards. With a thought, the Myriad Resonances Dragon Fang Sword Formation in his body activated and the Water and Wood Dragon Fang Swords hummed. Two tyrannical sword energies surged forth and bolstered his strike.\nAs the blade descended, it cleanly struck the nine-fingered bone palm.\nThe moment of collision was not an exaggerated scene full of explosions. Instead, the blade cleanly carved through the object like a hot knife through butter.\nLi Luo's figure ethereally flashed forward, appearing behind the Other as the killing intent within his eyes gradually faded.\nThe blade was slowly sheathed away. The bone palm suddenly broke apart, and a thin, bloody line appeared on the Other's neck. Two dominating sword energies were wreaking havoc within its body, and in the short span of a few breaths, the Other's body violently exploded with a bang, turning into countless squirming blood worms which melted into blood energy before completely dissipating.\nLi Luo exhaled deeply as he cut off the connection with the fiendish energy he had just utilized.\nAfter dealing with the Other, Li Luo turned towards Qin Yi. The latter was idly staring at him, as though shell-shocked by that crisp and stunning strike. When she finally realized that Li Luo was watching her, she regained her usual sense of calm and said with relief, \"Dragon's Head Li Luo, you have yet another outstanding result added to your amazing combat record.\"\nLi Luo shook his head. \"Without your assistance in containing it, I could not have done so with a single strike.\"\nThen he quickly took out the Blackwood Feather Fan and activated it, causing two streams of white light to appear around himself to hurriedly bolster his resonant power recovery. This was a dangerous environment, so he had to maintain peak condition at all times.\nJust as Qin Yi spoke, her gaze suddenly changed as well. She had felt a disturbance within the blood mist a distance away.\nShe swiftly rushed forward and stood by Li Luo's side. Lifting her palm, the Boundless Heavy Ocean Pearl floated above them, transforming into a screen of water that protected the duo.\nLi Luo frowned. \"Could it be that after dealing with the Other's clone body, we attracted the attention of the even mightier true body?\"\nAs the two watched in trepidation, the blood mist rippled and several figures milled out, shooting wary glances at them.\nWhen both sides realized who they were looking at, they felt equally shocked.\nThese people were not foreign to him. It was Li Lingjing, Lu Qing'er, Li Fengyi, Li Wuyuan, Zong Sha, Zhu Zhu, and their other familiar friends.\n\"Qing'er, Second Sister, Cousin Lingjing?\"\nWhen the two sides met, they seemed a little taken aback. However, they did not approach each other; they remained vigilant instead. It seemed like the other party had already had a taste of the Others' transforming antics.\nLu Qing'er's cautious gaze was focused upon Li Luo as she asked in concern, \"Are you alright, Li Luo? We felt strong undulations of energy and rushed over.\"\n\"We just encountered an Other that had adopted Cousin Lingjing's appearance. However, we managed to kill it,\" Li Luo explained.\nLi Lingjing's gaze turned frigid upon hearing this. The two sides then probed each other with further questions until they finally confirmed each other's identities. Although the Others could adopt the appearance of their friends, one could discover flaws if they inspected them closely.\nThis led both parties to heave sighs of relief.\nWith most of the group gathered, Li Luo's tense body relaxed slightly as he asked, \"What happened here?\"\n\"Damn it. We have no idea how an Other appeared. Its strength exceeds the rules of the Spiritual Resonance Cave, reaching the Greater Heavenly Resonance Tier. Only when everyone worked together in a grand battle were we able to force it to retreat. However, it created this blood mist that covers the skies and the ground, scattering the groups. It has repeatedly ambushed us with the aid of its transformation abilities, and the number of casualties were tremendous by the time we were able to regroup once again.\" Zhu Zhu's expression was steely green.\nThe rest looked gloomy as it seemed they had suffered greatly as well.\nLi Luo glanced around him and realized that the group had shrunk significantly. Only some of the elites from the different powers had managed to survive.\nThe bright side was that Li Fengyi and Li Jingtao were unharmed.\nLi Lingjing hefted the Aquamarine Bamboo Python Staff and fell silent after gazing at Li Luo. \"You should never have left the thatched cottage.\"\nWith the protective wards of the cottage, the Other would not be able to harm him so long as he remained inside.\n\"You dumb brat. You could have sat there safely, so why did you run out!?\" Li Fengyi angrily shouted as she smacked his shoulder.\nThey had experienced the sheer terror of the Other, and even with the addition of his Lesser Heavenly Resonance Tier strength, they probably wouldn't be able to tip the scales in their favor.\nLi Jingtao also sighed.\nLi Luo instead flashed the most radiant smile he was capable of. \"Aren't you aware of my personality? How could I sit idly? Saying all of this is useless now. We just have to decide how we can deal with the Other.\"\nZong Sha from the Heavenly Origin Ancient College smiled bitterly. \"Although the Other has Greater Heavenly Resonance Tier strength, I think it's limiting itself. The reason it has continued to entangle itself with us is not because its afraid of our numbers. Instead, I have a feeling it's toying with us. In its eyes, we are just a group of trapped mice, capable of entertaining it.\"\nZong Sha's blunt words caused the group's expressions to turn ugly. It was clear that they all felt the same way.\n\"Damn it! How could an Other appear in the Spiritual Resonance Cave? What are the Duke experts outside doing?!\" Zhu Zhu berated.\nThis was a question no one could answer. It was the first time such a strange development had happened.\n\"Huh. Is the blood mist fading?\" Jiang Wanyu suddenly asked.\nThese words caused the group to feel a sense of surprise. The all-encompassing blood mist was indeed dissipating gradually.\n\"What is going on?\" The group stared at each other with uncertain expressions. The Other had not been injured, but the blood mist was disappearing. This abnormality must have been intentionally caused by it.\nHowever, the group did not have to wonder for too long. They could hear the sound of liquid flowing from afar.\nAs the sound got louder, the strong stench of blood wafted over as well.\nEveryone knew that something was not right, so they hurriedly gathered together, their eyes focused upon the direction of the sound. A few moments later, their eyes shrank. A towering river of blood was rushing towards them from the mist. The blood river curled up into a wave a hundred feet tall, smashing the void apart.\nWithin the blood river was a single blood lotus, on top of it was a handsome male garbed in white. He was looking at the crowd with a compassionate gaze.\nHis shiny, bald head was laced with blood-red lines that squirmed like wriggling worms. They gathering atop his head and gradually penetrated his flesh before transforming into two bloody, curved horns that made him resembe a devil. At the tips of the horns were two chalky white eyeballs that swiveled, causing a chill to run down the spines of everyone present.\nHowever, what was most terrifying about the Other was not its appearance. They could distinctly feel that the energy it was emanating was increasing in intensity.\nIn the short span of a few dozen breaths, it surpassed the Greater Heavenly Resonance Tier.\nDirectly stepping into the Duke Stage!\nWhen faced with this jaw-dropping pressure, a few of the less resolute individuals fell onto their butts, their expressions in complete despair. This was a Duke Stage Other!\nHow were they going to stop it?\nThis was essentially a death sentence!", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

Well, this game isn't a typical strategy where the player pumps out tens of the same units. No, every soldier here has his own name, looks, rank and abilities. Each soldier who dies during a mission will be lost forever. Your team truly is indispensable, as the only truly new recruits that we will gain will be apemen, who will never compare well to human soldiers - who by the way gain experience during the course of the game. Those are the bare facts.Storyline\nThe whole story begins somewhere within Siberia, where a guy called General Emerson finds a very interesting device and brings it back to the USA with him. In time American scientists working on it finally figure out what it is: a fully functioning time machine, which can send anything placed within it a couple of million years back in time. They also discover a very interesting mineral which they call siberite, and which is told to be able to cure the world's energy problems. Immediately a problem emerges: the mineral's only source is believed to be in Siberia, firmly under Russian control. American leaders therefore hatch a cunning plan. They send an army expedition back in time to extract the mineral from Siberia and move it to the Alaskan mainland back when the Bering-Alaska land bridge still existed. If they succeeded, the Americans would be within possession of the most potent energy resource in the world, which would secure their domination.\nHowever, there is a problem. The first American soldiers who arrive at their destination back in time end up none other than under fire by what seems to be very angry Russians. Russians who have also arrived back in time, but from the a different timeline...\nOne has to admit at the very start that the storyline is a strong side of the game. It is climactic, complicated and quite realistic. The storyline is also non-linear with many details in the campaign changing depending on the player's actions, up to and including the campaign endings.Graphics and sound\nThe graphics engine might not be the best looking game out there, but it is nonetheless detailed. Units are detailed, while the pre-rendered terrain is more than just eye-candy and actively influences warfare. Small things such as single trees impeding line of sight is something that most games never take into account. Ingame music changes based on what is currently happening on the screen, building suspension. While in a forest one can not only see but also hear it. Overall the audio-visual part of the game stands on a good level.Gameplay\nThe game is played in real time. A pause option is available, during which a player can plan his units' actions carefully. The interface is intuitive with a very short learning curve, so even a new player can be in the midst of the game very quickly. There is always something happening on the screen, however thanks to the reports of your units in battle, chaos doesn't occur all too often and the player can respond where necessary. This is of course a good thing, as units in Original War are never expendable. By far the main thing bases are used for are research of new types of armament, and building vehicles for your units to improve their damage and chance of survival. This means that bases in general aren't large, but small and provisional. Often times they are completely dismantled and rebuilt somewhere else during the course of a mission. Due to their provisional character, bases are rarely absolutely critical to the flow of the mission. Your soldiers can often time simply rebuild somewhere else, resources permitting. This of course is not the end of the list of innovative features. Original War offers many fresh, new things, giving a breath of fresh air to the stale RTS industry.Verdict\nOriginal War is innovative and (as the name implies) original. It can easily rival the best strategies of all time, despite its putting pressure on single player mode. Its feel, gameplay and low price make for a great package for any player. If you're ready to go back in time, make a trip to one of the shops listed below.", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

Make self-care a priority.\nSetting boundaries with others is another crucial aspect of integrating healing into your daily life. It’s important to prioritize your own needs and feelings. Don’t be afraid to say no or take time for yourself when necessary.\nPracticing self-compassion is also essential.

Take the time to prioritize your well-being and make self-care a regular part of your routine.\nIncorporating self-care rituals into your routine\nEmbracing self-care rituals in your daily routine can be transformative.

By consistently incorporating self-care practices, you create a safe and nurturing space for your inner child to thrive.\nHere are three self-care rituals to consider:\n- Mindful Meditation: Take a few minutes each day to sit in stillness, focusing on your breath and grounding yourself in the present moment. This practice calms your mind, reduces stress, and cultivates self-awareness.\n- Journaling: Set aside time to write down your thoughts, feelings, and experiences. Journaling allows you to express yourself freely, release pent-up emotions, and gain insights into your inner world.\n- Nurturing Your Body: Engage in activities that promote physical well-being, such as exercise, healthy eating, and getting enough rest.

These will be explored in the subsequent section.\nSetting boundaries and practicing self-compassion\nSetting boundaries is crucial for nurturing self-worth and maintaining healthy relationships. It involves clearly communicating your needs, limits, and expectations to others while respecting their boundaries as well. By setting boundaries, you create a safe space for yourself where you feel valued and protected.\nThis process may require you to say no, which can be difficult, but it allows you to prioritize your own needs and prevents resentment from building up.\nPracticing self-compassion is equally important. It entails treating yourself with kindness, understanding, and forgiveness, especially during times of struggle. By being gentle and compassionate with yourself, you cultivate a positive self-image and develop the resilience needed to navigate through challenges.\nAs you establish healthy boundaries and nurture self-worth, you are on the path of celebrating your journey of healing.\nCelebrating Your Journey of Healing\nCelebrate how far you’ve come on your healing journey, cherishing each step along the way. It’s important to acknowledge and honor the progress you’ve made in healing your inner child.

Sharing your story not only allows you to reflect on how far you’ve come but also provides inspiration and encouragement to others who may be on a similar path.\n- Express gratitude: Take a moment to express gratitude for the progress you’ve made. Write a gratitude journal, thanking yourself for the courage and resilience you’ve shown. Cultivating an attitude of gratitude can amplify your joy and appreciation for your healing journey.\nEmbrace the opportunity to celebrate your journey of healing. Remember, each step forward is a testament to your strength and resilience.\nFrequently Asked Questions\nHow long does it typically take to heal your inner child through shadow work?\nHealing your inner child through shadow work varies for each individual, making it challenging to determine a specific timeline.

{"id": "4984", "text": "Feeling a little tired today then, wanna sit down and do nothing?\nSo read this while you still have the strength left too – it may help explain why…\nSee every day, you waste yourself a little more, and every day the cost gets a little higher, so you get a little ‘older’, because you are LEAKING, and that ages you in every sense of the word, but WORSE – it attracts PARASITES. See Parasites are the real reason you are LETHARGIC ALL THE TIME – one of the greatest curses of the modern age – your natural vim and vigor as a child has gone, yet you are still young and there is nothing wrong with you.\nSee, you are getting slower, dumber, duller, uglier, all whilst not having a clue what to do about it, you even lack the energy to try to fix it even though you KNOW what is happening at an instinctive level – YOU HAVE BECOME LETHARGIC.\nWhatever any friend or health professional tells you, being Lethargic for no reason is NOT NATURAL, it is a symptom of something else, something bad. See, you can never stop leaking itself, that’s normal – leaking is living, but you CAN stop parasites, indeed you HAVE to. Parasites will NEVER stop feeding on your ‘leaks’ until you are dead, opening up those taps so your gift literally drains out of you…\nNow lethargy is a VERY old Greek word we have via French Latin that actually means – ‘inactive through forgetfulness caused by a hidden reason’. Get that, it means something in the black felt background of life is ‘eating you’, and over time lethargy becomes a habit YOU ACCEPT – hell you are just tired and need to relax, do some more of those negative behaviors, that make you even more lethargic.. get it? It’s a negative feedback loop, it’s bloody deadly – it’s so deadly that toward the end you will be so drained it will even take your ability to ‘think’, to remember who and where you are. It will take your consciousness in time, even your sense of yourself.\nLethargy is the beginning of a slow unpleasant death for the gifted. Worse it will ‘show’ on you – yep, old wives tale or not, the state of your soul starts to show on your face from your late 20s, should you be gifted. If you do nothing then the very troubled amongst you will end up looking like fairy tale monsters, no matter how pretty you start out as, and that’s just too sad.\nI know – it’s hard to believe that the number 1 reason you, with all your amazing ancestral gifts, do not feel more energetic, more spiritual is actually your loss of ‘yourself’, your GIFT every day VIA PARASITES, but it’s true. This pointless loss turns you from something pretty special into something pretty nasty. You become ‘repulsive’ in a spiritual sense, indeed over time you become covered in Parasites, which some of us can sense, even ‘see’ – you actually become repellant instinctively to other gifted folks as you have a bad ‘taste’ or ‘smell’ at a spiritual level, which can be overpowering up close.\nEven worse than that, eventually YOU MAY ACTUALLY BECOME A PARASITE yourself to survive in a symbiotic sense, you actually have to engage in Parasitic behaviors to keep going.. it becomes a ‘food chain’. But don’t relax.. it may not be your fault, but it is your problem. And it’s a big one.\nBut there is hope, real, absolutely genius hope written down long ago and far away by the ancient Daoists no less, hope that WORKS. See this Parasite thing is VERY common amongst the unschooled gifted of the world, it’s SO common you could almost call it a ‘rite of passage’ – you sort of have to go through it. Teachers like me even use it to actually spot the unschooled but highly gifted, its one of the biggest tells there is, cause it’s almost a guarantee. But… be SUPER clear here, BEING a happy, usually repeat PARASITE in yourself is NOT what I mean – the Gifted ATTRACT Parasites, they only start to ACT like one to survive, only nasty little animals are parasites in themselves, driven via the taste of the ‘magic of it’. The Gifted on the other hand usually hate themselves for it, in their more ‘Reflective’ moments, should they still have any…\nNow, this is a longer, sharper Post designed to get you to ACT. NOW. Yes, you are special, gifted, but you won’t be much longer if you keep doing this stupid shit… So never feel a moment’s hesitation in killing parasites, of all and any kind, because once they become established in your life it really is ‘you or them’. So the trick to dealing with them is not only to ‘smoke out’ the ones you already have but immediately dispose of any new ones that come into your life. If you don’t they will just keep coming, cause they ‘sense’ the ones that are already there, they sense that you are already a victim, that you ‘accept’ being a victim, you are so stupid you actually think there is some benefit to being a victim, you think getting them to ‘like you’ by keeping them happy is the best way, the only way you know how to deal with this..\nIt’s not – you are being CONNED, that way is the road to your very own personal hell. But for now, to focus your motivation for the rest of this post, know this – whenever you engage with a parasitic behavior whatever else you are doing will FAIL in some way – see all that ‘Being’ you ‘should’ be directing at what you are actually doing, that you NEED FOR that activity you are ‘willing’ to succeed, actually goes to the parasite instead, because parasites ‘weaken you in the moment of action’. That’s why parasites love the big moments in your life, even if you don’t recognize them, as so much more of your valuable ‘effort’ is waiting there, all nicely packaged and ready to be hoovered up by the greedy little bastards…\nKey Lesson – You need to become aware and get rid of as many Parasites in your inner and outer life as you can, period. All this spiritual work you are going to do is going to go way faster and way better if you simply start to snuff out what is eating you already are a priority – you may already have so many parasites that it will feel amazing to get shot of them, make a huge difference to your life too. Yes, parasitic thought-forms become an external reality once they are strong enough through emotional repetition, it is a key indicator. Your parasites are ALWAYS in you at the start, before they grow to dominate your life in many ways, but it’s important NOT to identify with your Parasites – they are NOT you, they are ON YOU. Be clear – YOU leak, do everything from stupid little habits to full-blown self-destructive crap but it’s the Parasite that makes those leaks routine, ‘normal’, make them disappear, unconscious. It’s your parasites that scream at you for more, that fight you when you try and stop, that threaten you when you decide to stop. Make the change – without them, changing your life would be child’s play, with them it becomes a pointless descent into mediocrity.\nThis is a Key Lesson for the Gifted only, one that everyone one of us has needed at some time or another. See, I’m STILL not going to develop you but it is time to start to ‘husband’ your Gift, look after it a little, conserve yourself.. You do this starting to get rid of what is depleting you all the time, what is sucking the life out of you, making you dumber, while at the same time starting to protect yourself from the same shit happening to you over and over. It’s wise to put it in your mind now, as some find them the most difficult aspect of this spiritual stuff, as it’s just too hard for you…’you’ are just too NICE.\nLater in this post, I’ll help you with the top 3 Saviours of your Gift that help against parasites: engaging with Groups of Gifted People, Cleanliness, and Novelty. These are major lifelong activities that you will come to understand intuitively once you start in earnest.\nNow before we start know this about Parasites, the most important thing to remember – All parasites, in whatever form you choose to identify them, are about CONTROL, they actively try and control you, manipulate you to get what they want. Whatever the approach they use or ‘end game’ behavior they want from you is, ultimately THEY MUST CONTROL you to achieve it. When you have parasites, when you are infected by them, you must SUBMIT to this control for it work for ‘them’, you must go along with it. Over time the CONTROL they have over you is all they need, it BECOMES THEIR END GAME – you become a ‘puppet’. If they DON’T TRY AND CONTROL YOU IT VERY UNLIKELY THEY ARE A PARASITE.\nNo one voluntarily submits to being controlled for no reason, for no benefit, so the 2nd most important thing to know about Parasites is they use DECEIT, they use LIES, and they USE FEAR to achieve that level of control. This is usually based on representing either themselves or the approach or the end game activity of the parasite as being of BENEFIT to you. IT NEVER IS, it is always a con. TO BE CONTROLLED IS TO BE FED ON, TO BE A FORM OF FOOD, it is a process that eats you.\nAnd to make the above work they must be invisible, so know the 3rd most important thing – they must disappear – your parasites have to hide in your mind, in your life, behind other things, behind genuine real things, things you think are GOOD in some way, by appearing to be like them or by being totally unconscious. Parasites are here for the long term, you have them for LIFE, so they get very comfortable, they must create this false SPACE to exist, a false part of you, of your personality which is NOT YOU. And once that space exists it attracts OTHER PARASITES. In an almost literal way, they construct a whole other building on the side of the house that is you, and fill it will cool stuff, so their friends will come, as this also strengthens them, helps protect them – they will work as a team, so if one can’t get you today another one will step in.\nBut worse, much, MUCH worse is this, the reason parasites are SO BAD for the gifted – OVERTIME ‘YOU’ BECOME ADDICTED TO BEING CONTROLLED. You like it, want it, you think it’s special. It’s not, BEING CONTROLLED IS DEATH ITSELF – parasites are the No 1 reason you are denied the power of your gift, that you cannot use it yourself, other things are taking it from you, STEALING IT. In the New Testament sense of it, Parasites are the ‘Thief in the Night’, the dark of your unconsciousness, of your habits and addictions. See, your desire to be controlled is not ‘you’ anymore, it’s the parasite pretending to be ‘you’ – it has ‘won’, you can no longer step back and ‘see it’ anymore. This is the goal of all parasites, to be so deeply embedded in your EGO you believe they are ‘you’.\nUntil, of course, someone comes along and explains this to you, then you can try to ‘go against it’, to stop ‘loving it’ because of the temporary ‘way it makes me feel’, to realize that is a con job. See, ‘you’ don’t actually EVEN feel that way, ‘it’ does… what you feel is its happiness at being ‘satisfied’. Yep, your Parasites are REALLY NOT YOU, but they can do a damn good impression of you, not that it is perfect of course. You can stop them when you know how, through seeing either the fake value they pretend to add or the fake pain they pretend to remove, which both end up simply in the feeling of relief they have temporarily stopped controlling you in some way, primarily the removal of the fake fear that is ‘anxiety’.\nNow I know that it is VERY HARD for you to get this intuitively – to accept it, as most folks consider their bad habits and addictions to be ‘weaknesses of character’, mistakes even, ‘hell they are my happy place, everything else is so boring’, you say. So know that they create that – normal life is NOT BORING for the gifted, it is a con job that is being ‘done’ to you. They are independent entities that have got ‘inside you’, connected up to some of your fundamental systems, and can now deeply affect your experience of the world through your senses and emotions. They can control you BUT they are not you. And you know this. See it is VERY COMMON for the gifted to hate themselves for doing something they now consider ‘disgusting’ JUST AFTER YOU HAVE SATISFIED THE ADDICTION. To not even recognize yourself, the person who wanted that as, temporarily, that artificial control has gone, the parasite is asleep so no longer cares what you do for now. That ONLY HAPPENS WITH PARASITIC BEHAVIOURS, it does not happen with anything else, and is one of the core ways to know, for certain it’s a parasite.\nAnything that tries to control you in this way is A PARASITE, and you must learn to spot this, initially in your own mind, in your feelings, in your thought processes. Fighting you parasites is ALWAYS ABOUT NOT SUBMITTING TO THEM ANYMORE – TO BECOME AWARE AND THEN STOP THE CONTROL. However, you have to stop this by changing your attitude toward them, because previously you have given yourself to them like it is nothing, you have done it automatically, out of habit, out of just being a fool, cause no one told you this at school…\nThe number 1 way this happens to you, the way they get to you, is by being NICE. So let’s start a BIG THING on the left-hand path – next time someone calls you NICE, kind, special, punch them in the face – they have just called you a ‘harmless fool’. Remember this – its fine to ACT nice for this reason, for that time, hell everyone has a life… however BEING nice is the kiss of death, so never let NICE be where you ‘live’, your character, what others expect from you, who you are, cause then you are a doormat, for every little rat to come and piss on.\nSee ‘they’ know you are ONLY being nice because you are weak and unable to defend yourself (even though you are blissfully unaware of that as you have been brainwashed by society), you have to be nice cause you don’t know how to defend yourself. BEING NICE as an attitude to life MEANS YOU ARE VULNERABLE to parasites because you ‘go along’ with their crap, you accept what is said and done at ‘face value’, you welcome it in because you TRUST IT, instead of testing it, being suspicious of it, and looking at what is behind it. See, being NICE ACTUALLY MEANS YOU ACCEPT EVERYTHING ON THE BASIS THAT IT IS GOOD because Society has bred you to believe this – ‘there are no dangers out there, we are civilized now, YOU CAN TRUST US’. Bad news, IT’S NOT, AND YOU CAN’T TRUST ANYTHING, WE WALK AROUND KNEE DEEP IN DANGER EVERY SECOND OF EVERY DAY, AND NIGHT. We are fooled by parasites, and many other things because we are NICE. To paraphrase the movie line – society has fooled you into believing the darker side of the spirit world does not exist, but it does.\nTo explain with examples – the main low-level ‘personal’ parasitic behaviors that gifted folks have are best referred to as Self Sabotage rather than Addiction or the other self-destructive types, unconsciously Antagonistic being another big one. There is a whole set of them but let’s just do the 2 really common ones – ‘obstruction’ and ‘prevarication’. Now here it’s important to get first that Parasites are ‘Organised’ and ‘Subtle’, they plan ahead – yes, they are sitting watching for their cue, for the usual opportunities to do stuff to you, BUT they don’t want you to notice, they don’t want you to see it, cause then you will fight. Parasites need to lead you there, to make this mistake or that one, they rarely just knock something out of your hands, much as that can start to happen when you have become very aware of them, and have a good defense for the subtle stuff.\nIt’s important to get this point overall because it means you can now know, you can detect them in ADVANCE – that you CAN SEE IT COMING. And that, ladies and gents, boys and girls and whatever else you style yourself as – IS THE TRICK TO DEALING WITH PARASITES.\nObstruction is the negative control of your actions to cause unhappiness, upset in the short/medium term – the main symptoms you experience are that you are clumsy/forgetful/fridge blind. All these occur because they, though your unconscious co-operation, have prepared a set of circumstances either seconds/minutes/hours before by getting you to do something ‘badly’, by preparing a scenario to allow you to be clumsy/forgetful/fridge blind – that shit does not just happen by itself. For example, you put something important down ‘thoughtlessly’ without noticing, which you then lose, OR you put something on a table in a dangerous position that you can easily knock over, or that is just in your way for something you ‘already’ knew you had to do in a moment. All of these cause momentary annoyance, an outburst of emotion, however trivial, that you are too weak to stop.\nPrevarication is the negative control that causes you to become stressed ‘later on’ for no reason, by stopping you from doing something important, you know you have to do, until the last min. Be clear this is not optional stuff, eg leisure activities, but stuff that directly affects your life and happiness, that there is no reason not to do. The driver of this is typically ‘I can’t be arsed’, or ‘Its hard’, neither of which are true in the specific case – you will make more trouble for yourself if you don’t do it and you can easily do it. The big tell for a parasite however is when you challenge yourself in this way but it still comes back to the way, ‘yes, but I’m too tired and need to watch screens, relax in some way, by doing nothing’. That’s a parasite – if you push yourself and question poor decisions that are very clearly wrong and you still argue it, then you know ‘it’s’ not acting in your best interest. As a sidebar know that MANY of your parasites use ‘tiredness’ as a go-to strategy to fuck with you, always be ready to push back against it – it’s a core form of the Lethargy process, a negative feedback loop that builds and builds.\nThese are your parasites preparing a way to achieve their goal. You learn to stop the issue happening by SPOTTING YOUR PARASITES PREPARING THEIR SCHEME, disrupting the little fuckers plan by ‘checking yourself in the moment of any suspicious activity’, got that – do a double-take that says..’woahhhhh, what did I just fucking do?’ when you notice you just did something STUPID unconsciously. Changing and preparing an attitude that says ‘I have these parasites, that do A,B,C, ALL THE TIME, so I NEED to stop that shit by always double-checking what I do that is related to these negative behaviors, AND crucially watching for ANY tendency to REPEAT the same patterns of behavior’.\nWith a little practice, it is actually quite easy to spot them, hiding in the shadows as you prop a dish up awkwardly, put a plate in front of the draw you are just about to open, drop your key on the stairs as you rush for the bathroom, or you suddenly feel overwhelmingly tired just are you start to open the 2nd letter that came this am. NOTICE THESE THINGS BY PREPARING AN ATTITUDE IN ADVANCE TO MAKE YOU NOTICE THEM. And then simply don’t do these types of things – go back and put right the ‘careless’ thing you ‘know’ will lead to the parasite’s ‘end game’ obstruction, prevarication goal, stop the little rodent’s ‘long con’ in its tracks. The parasite will even help you, by stepping up its game as soon as you fight, trying to get you to do it more, it won’t just give up – see parasites are not that clever, they are creatures of habitual patterns as that is all they know, particularly the small ones like these, they are scavenging food, they are not plotting to take over the world, just your dumb ass.\nIn this way, you start to fight… hell, you now know you ACTUALLY HAVE PARASITES, don’t you want to get rid of them, NOW? So know the above is your No1 ‘type’ of defense against the ‘dark arts’ of parasites you must develop this, and the more you do it, the more you will recognize the other, often much bigger ones, things like ‘crushing regret of the past’ (always pointless), ‘paralyzing fear of the future’ (always a fantasy), even those that come through parasitic people – see how you are manipulated, to see them coming… Easier to learn at the start, with the small stuff yes? So don’t see this as dorky and childish (another parasitic trick), see this as what it is – DEFENDING YOURSELF. Trust me in time it will take on a much bigger role in your life, but for now, know personal self-defense is an attitude that starts small and builds, best learn it the easy way via small stuff before you need to use it against the BIG STUFF…\nSo, the fundamental attitude of ‘the seeker’, and I’ve never met anyone who made progress on this path by not doing this – STOP TRUSTING YOUR UNCONSCIOUS SELF. Your ‘automatic pilot’ is corrupted – start to be suspicious of any and all actions, thoughts, and feelings that you have identified or think could be linked to parasites, and learn how to fight them. Yep, it’s about time you changed, as it’s the only way forward and the FIRST THING YOU DO IS TO CHANGE THE ROUTINES YOU AUTOMATIC PILOT USES VIA YOUR CONSCIOUS ATTITUDES TO SIMPLE THINGS, WHICH MONITOR YOUR UNCONCIOUS ‘ACTIONS’, TAKE BACK CONTROL. The only way to do that is to ‘check yourself’ when you do anything you ALREADY know is a common hideout for your parasites.\nKnow that right now the only real ability to change, to take back ‘control you have over yourself’ is through your pre-prepared ‘attitudes’ to a particular thing or circumstance, you can do nothing in the moment, it’s already too late – if ‘you’ try and do something new in the moment of the attack, try to ‘work it out’ via corrupted associative thinking it will just be another way for them to get to you. So just laugh at yourself instead, as ‘it’ has won this one, so use it as a reminder to construct a defensive attitude NOW – YOU MUST BUILD THE CASTLE WALL BEFORE THE ENEMY ATTACKS, NOT DURING THE ATTACK, SO YOU CLEARLY KNOW WHICH SIDE OF THE WALL ‘EVERYONE’ IS ON. Don’t worry about blocking out the good stuff with the bad when you start building these ‘wall’ attitudes at the start, fix it later – it is only when you have ATTITUDE ‘walls’ that you have a ‘castle’, something solid to defend and build – without walls its just ‘open house’ all day, everyday.\nHow to build defensive attitudes you ask? Ok very quickly… building conscious attitudes is a way to build unconscious defensive habits – the new attitude works by helping you ‘in the moment of the attack’, and eventually forms the defensive habit of ‘protecting you from those types of attacks all the time’, one leads to the other automatically, clever eh?. To build attitudes at the start you plan out in advance what you are going to do in response to a known set of ‘attack’ circumstances when they occur, plan out how you recognize it and react differently. Whatever stage of the parasites preparation you spot it at, you must define what the attack looks like, based on the 80/20 rule – select the most common type of circumstances first, and go to the root of them, as close to the start as you can. To build the new attitude you then focus on this specific attack type, defining a specific attack trigger for the specific type of, say, forgetfulness you have identfied, from a predetermined range of possibilities, say all the different ways you ‘prepare’ to lose things. Then you define a preset course of action, in terms of the specific corrective behavior for this type of forgetfulness – these actions stop the attack and hence stop the end goal of the parasite from happening. Sounds complicated, but it’s not, indeed it will become second nature for most gifted in a few days should you put the effort in at the start.\nBe clear – a defensive attitude is not a new personality, not a new belief or a goal, it is based on a set of instructions you follow when they are triggered by recognizing a potential parasitic attack before it happens. You can group these attitudes however you like, but at the start, it’s best to keep it simple until you learn to do it quickly. So a new defensive attitude toward forgetfulness say, when you spot the attack coming, spot yourself unconsciously preparing to ‘lose’ something later, then construct a set of instructions, a ‘protocol’ you follow to both stop the parasites preparation and then correct the unconscious behavior, therefore stop the parasites ‘end-game’ from happening. The key is to SPOT the attack happening at the START and then STOP the attack from being successful, so you can DEFEND YOURSELF. All defensive protocols (eg Stop Forgetting my Keys) start with the most common attitude trigger (eg dropping my keys) for one trigger circumstance (eg about to start losing my keys) and one corrective action (eg hang my keys on the hook), before you grow any number of protocols under that attitude to stop all the various types of attacks of that type (eg all the ways you forget things). Once you have a couple for losing your keys, say, you will find the same basic pattern and trigger types work on most other ones covered by the same Defensive Attitude, and you are simply changing bits of the detail of existing protocols. You will get much quicker at building them in a very short space of time, particularly when you have some confidence in them.\nGood and clever use of Defensive Attitudes can change your life VERY quickly, particularly with the type of parasitic behavior that upsets you the most, so don’t be shy about building lots of protocols, make a point of doing it whenever you ‘realize’ you forget something, say, that you don’t yet have a protocol for. Take a moment to identify all the stuff you normally forget for example and think back as to the sequence of events that often lead you to forget stuff, as you will find they are dominated by no more than 2 or 3 types of attack ‘pattern’, that are actually quite easy to remember. For example, unconscious placement of an important thing you then forget is by far and away the most common attack pattern in forgetfulness, but there are others, such as ‘mental block’ (you were sure to remember it consciously but the location is just gone ‘out of your head’) type of forgetfulness which tends to need quite a detailed protocol to fix, like a memory aid you make at the time because you ‘know’ you are going to forget it, as you have identified forgetting this type of thing already as a very common type of parasitic attack for you. However, try and focus on one type of defensive attitude at a time, at least until to notice a big decrease in that type of parasitic attack – get your defense up and running to a decent standard before you move on to other types of defensive attitudes, as this will help form the habitual aspect of that protocol behavior when you start to defend yourself automatically.\nThis system works for anyone who uses it correctly, however, a VERY common mistake is to start with BIG stuff before you have learned it well enough, ie to start with addictions or types of mental illness. DON’T – always start with very common small things, as it will help ingrain the key ‘trigger identification’ behavior in your mind. The best ones to use at the start are physical ‘ticks’, repetitive movements you do for no reason, ie swinging your legs, tossing a pen, clicking your knuckles etc etc, they happen all the time and are quite hard to fix so are a great way to learn. Annoying physical ticks are also great parasites to use because you cannot easily explain them, so it really brings home the point to most that it can only really be a parasite in a complex sense – you ‘think’ you feel ‘better’ doing physical ticks as an outlet for ‘nervousness’, BUT they are ‘comforting’ behaviors based on the removal of fake anxiety that something else (a parasite) has made you feel. They have NO VALUE IN THEMSELVES, they are a ‘Protection Racket’ type of parasite – it is saying to you ‘pay me this pointless behavior NOW or I will make you more nervous, as I have already led you to the point of feeling slightly nervous’, but all you are really doing is feeling ‘its’ relief at being fed – ‘you’ just lose…. get it? They are hard to fix as it can take most some time to understand and identify this parasites’ type of ‘preparation’ to push the tick on you, its plan to ‘get you to start the tick’, so you start by just stopping them every time you notice you have started. That is NOT a defensive attitude, that is losing, so use this shame of losing to drive you to think about what happens before you start the tick, so you can see it coming and hence develop the defensive protocol for it – YOU MUST SEE IT COMING TO BE ABLE TO DEFEND YOURSELF. Quick hint – all physical ticks are much more draining than you think because they are NOTHING TO DO with nervousness, it’s a total con… they are directly linked to a specific body position, a stance, usually a type of ‘sitting’ – yep, your parasite simply gets you to position your body in a specific way that quickly leads to the tick, nasty eh? So soon as you spot yourself positioning your body that way CHANGE IT, and the desire to do the tick will go away – stop the little bastard in his tracks. Believe in parasites yet?\nImportantly – 2 key things. Firstly, once you have ‘laid down’ a defensive attitude protocol NEVER CHANGE IT. Do not tinker with it in the moment, adjust it to suit this new idea you just had, as THAT IS THE PARASITE FIGHTING BACK – do it exactly as you set it up, every single time. Stick to it, it needs to be so ingrained in you that it becomes a permanent unconscious attitude, it becomes a GUARD DOG, one of many – you no longer have to consciously ‘mind your keys’, as you will find you do it ‘automatically’. See you are learning these attitudes the exact same way martial artists learn the body forms of their fighting art, by doing the same thing over and over again until it becomes habitual. The reason for this is that those skills HAVE TO BECOME HABITUAL TO WORK otherwise they are useless – there is no time to THINK when you are actually fighting, no conscious selection or pause for thought, what the fighter does is TOTALLY UNCONCIOUS, they fight automatically. It is exactly the same for you and your defensive attitudes, they are a spiritual martial art, burn them into yourself. Only this way will they still work when you are momentarily ‘absent from the wheel’, when you are very distracted, when you are drunk, when you are asleep because your parasite will wait for you in these moments…\nSecond, a defensive attitude is a defensive weapon, not an offensive one – it is a shield, a wall, a long spear. You can kill parasites with attitudes but it works overtime by starving them to death – they weaken, then die or leave. But well established or bad parasites, big groups of them won’t take this too well, they will fight back, and via this process, they become much more defined, they will ‘show’ themselves, their true colors – you will ‘realize’ them, develop a pattern in your mind through which you can ‘see’ them. This way you can kill them – use offensive techniques based on the identification, personification, and emotional weapons, as I will touch on below in this text. HOWEVER, at the start you HAVE TO STOP THEM ATTACKING YOU SUCCESSFULLY, you have to break the control they have, otherwise, you will barely know they are there, it is all just a ‘theory’. Once you can ‘see’ them, via defensive attitudes, you can kill them. Build your castle walls first, then next time they attack you can look down from the ramparts, in total and complete safety, and put a single, silver bullet through their nasty little heads. See the trick to fighting is NOT BEING ABLE TO LOSE, your ‘attack’ either succeeds or you miss – when you can defend yourself THERE IS NO RISK OF LOSING, and that’s when the fighting gets really easy…\nOver time you will notice you can grade your parasites in terms of their ‘power’ – most are small and can only act quickly in the moment, say you unconsciously dropped something, but some, particularly the sensory ones can affect your perception over a longer period of time. For example ‘fridge blindness’ is a powerful ‘gateway’ parasite, as it takes another level of power to stop you ‘seeing’ things, and often leads to much bigger issues if left unattended, but it can be beaten down quite quickly when you learn ‘how to see it coming’, just like all the rest. Hint – it’s a specific type of ‘urgency’ in yourself to find something, so look for it in yourself and don’t bother looking for anything important while you feel it, until you learn how to stop it. In time you will come to see that all parasites have a type of TENSION signature or shadow that can be used to detect them when they are active, when they are trying to control you in the moment, and this typically starts slowly and very subtly before the end game behavior is manifested in your mind. For now, always look for tension in yourself when you catch yourself wanting to do a parasitic behavior, then try and define the type of tension, physical or mental, dwell on it, turn it around a little in your mind, what it is, how does it look, sound, feel, smell, taste? Don’t worry that you see no causal connections between your nose or mouth, your parasite may still ‘be there’ in some way, find it… Use the state of your senses to help you see a ‘pattern’ for it, as that is an excellent way to create a pattern of inputs you can use to identify it. And then you can kill it.\nDon’t be shy about having a bit of fun with this process, help the change along by enjoying the ‘fight’ – recognize the sneaky bastards and beat those little freaks down, every time, as it will help you remember to do it, give you some satisfaction, some confidence in the process too. Feel the slight sense of VICTORY of it, the new ‘Power over Yourself’, you are now developing… Over time the construction of many defensive attitudes against all the different types of your parasites builds into the MASTER attitude of a ‘Fighter’, which becomes in time the attitude of the Aristocrat, becomes Noble. All of these exist in nature and are roles you should learn to play at the start, as they are going to be way more effective than the current collection of roles you have ‘fallen into’ over your life, and are just frankly holding you back. ‘Seriousness’ and ‘consistency’ come easily from these new roles, and that is what you will need for the rest of this, so start being suspicious – it will make you more aware, more conscious, more intelligent, and more able to defend yourself against parasites.\nSo, always TAKE A MOMENT TO CELEBRATE beating a parasite, feel the ‘win’ when you STOP the behavior BEFORE IT STARTS, even if it’s just a quiet ‘Yesssssss’ under your breath, (better a large grin and a loud ‘fuck you’ to said to an image in your mind but that is not for everyone). It will help on many different levels, but at the start it will help motivate you for the fight ahead – Power over Yourself comes much more quickly when you start to enjoy it, make progress, see the change, so always feel the thrill of the win, NOT the ‘effort’ of the struggle. This feeling of effort after success, the memory that the use of defensive attitudes takes effort again leads to ‘lethargy’ – the memory of even small efforts builds into a memory of bigger efforts that are ‘just too hard to try’, right now… so will demotivate you, and you will eventually give up because you are very weak at the start, unless you are ‘desperate’. However when you teach yourself to feel the ‘win’ instead you will be surprised by how quickly even the most arduous effort disappears and is replaced with a feeling of Power, even if you have rarely if ever experienced that feeling in life – you will be ‘inspired’.\nThe Left-hand path is ultimately about POWER, specifically the FEELING OF POWER, never forget that, as that is ultimately WHY IT WORKS – you will want to return to the feeling of power in yourself by choice, it will start to ‘dye your soul’. Power over Yourself is the best drug in the world because, unlike every other drug, it is A POSITIVE FEEDBACK LOOP – more you do it better it gets, and the better it gets the more you do it, it’s that simple and therefore it really is worth the effort at the start. So use it, be a HAPPY BASTARD to your parasites, start to ‘clean house’, no need to be morose or guilt-stricken (they are parasites, they are killing you), you are a fighter now, and that is the only way to fly… there is no need to ‘suffer from it’. In your external life, you may not be able to fight anything but ANYONE CAN FIGHT THEMSELVES – ENJOY IT!\nYeah… I know many of you will feel a little ‘overwhelmed’ at the start, that it all looks too difficult, it’s just another type of delayed gratification that’s just ‘too hard’ – to have to suffer in the ‘moment’ for some benefit ‘later’, like going to the gym or yoga class, dieting even, so I will give you some extra help with that at the end of this post. At the moment you have no feeling type reward to aim at, so it’s all just an intellectual exercise you have to force yourself to do. For now know that Forcing yourself, pushing yourself to do anything you ‘don’t want to do’ is the attitude of a SLAVE, and is what modern society has done to you – you accept being a slave, so you look at everything in that same ‘negative’ way, through the thick smoky prism of FEAR, continual low-level fear. And this ‘dooms’ you to repeating the same shit, over and over… indeed this slave mentality robs even the otherwise rich, famous, successful of any real joy in themselves, so they suffer on with ‘other fears’. This fear infects every aspect of your life and is one of the main reasons parasites find it so easy to ‘own your ass’ – they use your accepted, low-level fear, the fear of ‘how the world is’, on you every damn day, your whole bloody life becomes one, big, long ‘picking the lesser of 2 evils’ game, that you play unconsciously in your mind like is fucking normal.\nIt’s not normal, you are ‘entitled’ to your birthright, your ‘gift’, but these fucking parasites are taking it from you, and you just accept it as another form of slavery simply because it is ALL YOU KNOW. You are literally bred to BE A SLAVE by society on purpose, all of its touchpoints on your life emphasize this fact, ramming this fear or that one down your throat every second. BUT, you were actually born to be a fighter, a witch, a warrior princess, so it’s time to remember that, time to be ‘confident’ again…But that is some way in the future – the actual sense of Victory is a higher ‘conscience’ emotion and cannot be faked, Buddhists actually call it ‘Equanimity’, better ‘Serenity’, as you are so victorious nothing can touch you anymore (both these words have lost their original depth, this emotion is enormous compared to the trivia you feel), and starts as a powerful sense of ‘balance’, but don’t worry about that now, it comes when it’s ready so just try to feel the little win thrills for now, as that will help.\nFor now, just know that all those Zen warriors in Japan focused their whole lives on achieving this state for a reason – it is the core of Bushido, what it means to ‘live it’, indeed the histories are full of tales of some ‘to the death’ sword fight or other where one of the protagonists stops halfway and calmly asks, ‘what would you say at this moment?’, as a test of their mental state, to see if they have finally lost all fear of death. Long before that, the Roman army followed the Cult of Mithra, of the Mithradates Mysteries, the secret core of our old friend Zoroasters religion, the last mystery school to survive the decline of the Greeks into a ‘tourist nation’, because it focused on delivering this state to everyday soldiers, the state of the Unconquered Sun, and who stuck with it in secret for this very practical reason, long after the Roman empire forced everyone else to become Christian. These mystery school ‘initiations’ were arguably even more effective at delivering the shocks so prized by Zen to this day, but sadly the similarity of these 2 spiritual practices is lost on modern scholars, they don’t put all that bull washing, riding and killing together with the famous Ox herding images of early Zen. See, ‘once upon a time in the West’ we had our very own Zen, hundreds of temples and unground grottoes have been found everywhere, even under Christian Churchs no less, but in the 4th century, the newly powerful Christians reveled in getting their ‘own back’, and wiped Mithradates off the face of the earth by the late 5th… Yep, those Christians with their revisionist history books again and again in the West, much as they could not stop us celebrating Sol Invictus birthday every 25th December, and shaking hands as a formal greeting, and many other such newly ‘Christian’ rituals… Sadly these rituals have lost their original meaning, of what that original magic meant, but right now that is not important.\nFor now, just know that being a fighter is FUN, because the POWER of being a fighter will ‘pull’ you forward, all by itself, and when you make that leap, when you start to ‘chase the wins’ for that continual feeling of VICTORY, you will NEVER want to go back to being a ‘comfortable’ slave. See any sense of achievement you currently get as a slave is always about the relief of getting something done, of surviving it, of not failing this time, ‘you got through it’, so now you survive for another day, YOU CAN STOP NOW AND RELAX, ‘thank the lord I’ve finished, I can suffer less for a while’, like a good little slave… YOU APPROACH EVERYTHING WITH A SENSE OF FEAR. It is closely related to the mindset of the ‘villain’, of the petty criminal, about being ‘cunning’, being clever to ‘get by’, as a desperate slave, like your an extra in ‘Oliver Twist’, lying your way through life with the simple aim of not having to work anymore, of being a happy ‘pensioner’, like being able to stop having a life and relax is THE actually ‘goal of life’ – just a comfortable, pathetic death and a bit of stone with your name on.\nSo know that these are NOTHING TO TO DO WITH THE FEELING OF VICTORY – that is not what victory feels like, the ‘sense of victory’ happens by the removal of fear, you simply cannot feel it while you are still afraid. Right now even when you have ‘wins’ in your life you see them through the same fear prism, some of you even feel guilty about winning, it makes you uncomfortable, like someone may notice and decide to take it off you or fuck it up in some way, cause you are a slave, you have none of the freedom that power gives you, you are a victim, your default mindset is FEAR. However, much as this winning mindset, of the actual ‘need to chase the feeling of wins’ is not your current state of mind, trust me, its still there in all the gifted, waiting to be found, when you start to climb up ‘jacobs ladder’ rather than slide down it. For now know that winning in any contest where there is resistance, where you could easily lose is a good source of the feeling of a win, particularly gambling which is why so many unschooled gifted love it, should you allow yourself to feel it. Even beating your family at a board game can do this for you, just be conscious of the ‘next fear of not being liked’, by said family, does not come and fuck it up for you… In time you will see (very clearly) just how pathetic and pointless being a slave is, and I don’t just mean the knowledge that no one even notices you are alive, it’s more the fact that even you don’t even know you are alive. As the saying goes, to live in fear is to die many times over every day, but the free, the powerful, the victorious die only once…\nSo be a modern ‘Gentlemen’ or ‘Lady’ if you wish, sure, just carry a sword and learn how to use it too. Better still to be a little gangster – see gangsters don’t scare easy because they are not really part of society, they are outlaws cause they simply don’t drink the ‘Kool aid’ everyone is fed, cause they don’t want to play the slave game. Plus they already know you can’t trust anyone, hell they are gangsters, the least trustworthy folks on the planet, so they are suspicious of EVERYTHING. Yes, ladies and gents, boys and girls, you have got to get in touch with your bad self here, get a little badass, in fact, find that savage soul of yours and ‘man the fuck up’, cause ‘you’ need to start to ‘go against yourself’, against the PARASITES IN YOUR HEAD. And being nice ain’t going to work, being nice is what got your dumb ass here in the first place.\nThe number 1 way this behavior gets started before growing to dominate you is the desire to ‘get on’ with bad behaviors, habits, people or circumstances, to accept them, be ‘Liked’ by them. To be a ‘people pleaser’ is to be Nice with bells on, with bows and little hearts, it is a reflection of your inner state, your utter weakness, and stupidity. To ‘go along to get along’, to do a deal with your demons, both inner and outer, so you can think these things or people are going to behave, even that they ‘have your back’ – will be your friend and help you in this way or that, and its total crap. In the gangsta life they call this a ‘PROTECTION RACKET’, ‘Fire Insurance’, cause ‘they’ will burn you down if you don’t ‘pay them’ – ultimately the con works by paying them to protect you from them, you are just too stupid to see it, GET IT? It’s a CON, they don’t HAVE YOUR BACK, they are laughing at YOU and you know it – you are simply justifying being a slave to yourself or your circumstances, make you feel a little better about it maybe…\nIt’s totally unnecessary to be nice to as a form of exchange, see everyone knows you are ONLY being nice because you are weak, anxious, scared, stupid – you have been taught to have a victim mindset by society, to ‘do what you are told’, to ‘go along to get along’ and are fresh and ready to be pounced on by the rodents of your mind and the world… Remember this – Being nice has no value for the seeker – question everything, all the time.\nNow one of the big bad reasons you don’t already think this is another simple con – see maybe you ‘accept’ your glory days are already behind you… you ‘understand’ why you feel more fragile, more morose, more upset, more conflicted, more bored, more addicted, more painful, and way more confused. You ‘accept’ it because you are just ‘older’, you are just slowing down, aging disgracefully… Your wrong – being weak, compliant, eager to please in case everyone dislikes you, even though they are harmless trash you don’t even like IS JUST BLOODY STUPID.\nWhat.. you think often finding yourself being scared all the time of harmless things, NEEDING HELP but you not really know why is ACCEPTABLE? Hell, you probably need one form of drug or another just to cope with a difficult ‘conversation’, let alone anything genuinely scary. See, you tell yourself this is ok cause you don’t want to be a victim of ‘mental illness’, so you cope because you are still ‘strong’, whilst really not coping.. while hating every second of it, of trying to be ‘liked’. Be clear, sooner or later you won’t be strong enough to ‘cope’ anymore this way, sooner or later you will start to ‘fray at the edges’ and everyone will see it, except you…\nYou already know what or who they are in your heart, you already sense it in them and in yourself, you are already tattered and torn by this in your reflective moments. Yes, you have come to terms with your Parasites, why you have them. Maybe you were brought up poor and see that approach as the only way, as your go-to strategy to get on in life, you accept it, maybe you used to think that but are now too bloody weak to get rid of them. Maybe you have simply spent some time with other people already covered in parasites, maybe you don’t even remember how you got started with this habit or that one (very common) but now you are stuck with it.\nGET THIS – It doesn’t really matter why you are covered in parasites, you are unschooled gifted, this is the way it is for you.. what matters is that you realize what has happened and you start to make the change. If you don’t but do it anyway then you are most likely a Parasite yourself and should stop reading this now, maybe get yourself some therapy before your lack of ‘moral compass’ (as all the scum of the earth say at trial) gets you into more trouble than you can deal with, before you life consists of little more than waiting for the knock on the door, or listening to the ominous sound of metal doors slamming shut behind you. This is what you deserve…\nNow – next steps… So it’s important for you to ‘get’ upfront what we are talking about here, what the next step after you have committed to fighting your parasites is – you must see it on another level, not JUST the issue itself, you must see what is behind it. See this is about one of the greatest blessings the ancient Daoists ever gave us – the personification of all are draining behaviors, habits, relationships and circumstances as PARASITES, that feed on our Gift, both inside of us and out. Much as it is very rarely done even by 4th wayers these days, to see your bad habits and destructive patterns as bugs, worms, spiders, and in the Daoist sense actual combinations of bug types with names that are genuinely stomach-churning, is a key teaching for the Gifted, much as the Jews stuck to calling them Demons. (Don’t write in please, I know Gurdjieff used it in some of his one-to-one teachings..)\nBut be clear – this is not ‘just’ a conceptual exercise. Parasites in whatever form they take become real, whether as energetic thought forms in your head or external circumstances. If you prefer to see these things as figments of your imagination then fine, this lesson will still work, but it really is best to see these things, these parasites as REAL, because they are.. And the ones in your head and body are going to actually fight you to stay alive – fool you, lie to you, hurt you, whatever they can to survive one more day – you are their world, their host, you are ALL THEY HAVE, indeed some of the stronger ones have actually become you, your character, for no other reasons that you are too lethargic to stop them.\nTo repeat, it is not your fault you are lethargic, that is what these things have done to you – you are stuck in a negative feedback loop and need to change, need to step out of the whole symbiotic circle. Everyone has a problem with this at the start until you develop a sense for what drains you, against what protects you, even benefits you in the everyday world. Takes a while though, so to help out I’m going to tell you, here and now. See, if you don’t start to fix these issues then no matter what you do to develop yourself, even build up your gift, it won’t be enough – You are simply going to waste it, on all this crap that is eating you – it’s like pouring fresh water into a sieve…\nDon’t feel bad, it’s important not to lose your head here, panic et al – that will just keep you stuck here. It IS important to get a little cold-hearted, to get a little mean, to get in touch with your ‘Bastard Self’, cause right now the only power you have access to emotionally is TO GET MAD AS HELL ABOUT THIS. Getting mad will give you the energy to deal with YOURSELF, your lethargy in a way that you can repeat it. You are going to be reacting to something you now perceive as horrible in a RAGE, get used to it first – don’t get mad at yourself, get mad at the parasites ON yourself. See them as separate to you, even though they are in your mind they are NOT YOU. Got that?\nSo what do you do? First you must understand this – Parasites cause leakage of your gift which tends to be small at first, but if these happen all the time or with high levels of emotion in circumstances that become routine they can be deadly. It becomes an acceptable habit or routine you either don’t notice or don’t care about. It always starts slow, it is trying to feed off you, not kill you, it wants you to barely notice and not care, or perceive it as some benefit to you. It will only show itself when you fight it, only stop being harmless or useful when you stop feeding it, then you will have to kill it, metaphorically speaking. Use this technique to IDENTIFY your parasites, both inner and outer, and see them as NOT YOU.\nSecond – you must then re-identify your problems as Parasites in the Insect sense of the word, as soon as you recognize them AT THE TIME. The best way to do this is to personify them as bugs, creepy crawlies, spiders – pick the type you hate the most. Daoists use worms as back 2000 years ago worms actively invaded rural peoples’ bodies and killed them slowly, usually from water, so worms were way worse to them than the cute little science project you remember them from. For most western people its best to use Spiders, use small spiders at the start or work up to spiders if it’s too much, just use Flys for now. Don’t use rats or mice as most people have never seen what they do in the wild and think they are cute.. Just as an FYI – most actually ‘parasitic people’ (who actually are parasites themselves) hate spiders at a ‘terror’ level (they recognize themselves maybe..), whilst a lot of gifted find them quite interesting, but not always.\nThird – the main thing is that when you find yourself engaged with either thought or activity that is Parasitic from previous identification, is that you ‘see’ it as a spider crawling somewhere on you or a fly buzzing around/on you face, you feel the ‘shiver’ of it – start to ‘choose’ to represent the parasitic behaviors, situations or people as actual bugs, they have invaded your space and are crawling on you or in your mind. Literally, feel it if you can, feel the revulsion in yourself that it causes – I’m not going to go into silly levels of detail here I’m sure you get the picture. Then bat or slap them away, FAST literally like you would an annoying fly or a spider – get mad and STOP that thought or activity immediately and then DO SOMETHING ELSE.\nIf it comes straight back literally straightaway then shriek, yell if able, make a point of denying it.. of telling it TO FUCK OFF, even out loud if that helps. How far you want to go with this is up to you, however, I know people who will literally mentally kill the spider, crush it in their mind’s eye, some will even burn it with a blue/white flame from a ‘mental’ blow torch, seems to work for them, watching it rapidly shrivel up and smoke into ashes. Give it a try.. or use something else as you like. The point is you are killing something horrible that is trying to feed off you without you noticing, ok?\nRemember – It’s horrible, it’s a PARASITE AND HAS NO VALUE IN THIS WORLD, IT IS USING YOU TO SURVIVE AND WILL KILL YOU IF IT HAS TOO – SO KILL IT FIRST. It is an aberration of your evolution, it HAS NO USE FOR YOU. Don’t engage it in conversation, don’t reason with it, don’t put it off till later, don’t pick it up and take it outside, don’t use a humane trap to release it into the field later, crush it back to the shit stain it started as.. NOW.\nSo, the top 3 Saviours of your Gift are Groups of Gifted People/Cleanliness/Novelty – these are the things you can start to use to help conserve you. Don’t worry about why too much now, just try and do them – PARASITES HATE THESE BEHAVIOURS.\nFirstly, ‘Groups’…. If your situation allows ‘you’ should start to think about constructing a small but VERY useful group of like-minded souls (2-3 is ideal), to take this journey with. Quite apart from the obvious help, cross-check, motivation, social etc.. the two BIG benefits of groups is that like-minded gifted folks will energize you, and you will start to see the difference between yourself and other even Gifted folks. This way you get a sense of yourself in ESSENCE by seeing how different you are – this ‘seen’ difference between the gifted helps you to progress, much as it is WAY to early to say ’embrace’ this… See the biggest difference between Gifted and normal is that you have something inside, often from long ago and far away, that dominates who you are and what happens to you – you are living out the same path as your ancestors. Normal folks are empty of this, everything is outside of them, and even with someone else’s borrowed gift they are always chasing what they find magical in ‘someone else’, like a parasite.\nBE CAREFUL WHO YOU CHOOSE – forming a group with normal people will not only slow you down, it will also deplete you, (and over time that will become unrecoverable), as you are effectively carrying them at a major cost to yourself. Try and organize your life so you spend your time with people who are better than you in some way, as a character, in terms of their ‘taste’. Don’t spend your life with dorks, skanks and parasites cause it easy.. They will just make you weaker than you already are. BE VERY SELECTIVE, EVEN TAKE ADVICE, DON’T GET THIS WRONG – keep it small and with folks you in some way look up to.\nCleanliness… Being clean features in every type of spiritual practice on this earth for a really good reason – it dramatically reduces the flow of your leaks, stops your gift ebbing away, wasted on parasites, human or otherwise. So just start being MUCH cleaner physically, washing twice a day, baths/showers, and NEVER put the same clothes back on, change often, into something clean.. something that makes you feel clean, PARTICULARLY what sits next to your skin. Dress so you feel you look good all the time, not like a homeless tramp, literally throw worn or ugly clothes out so you can’t wear them anymore, replace stuff often, particularly underwear. Change your bed often, at least once a week, more if you sweat in it, make a habit of being tidy as that will make your environment clean. Organize yourself to ensure you are clean, well dressed, and tidy, have some class, make a thing of it – ‘go against yourself’ to do it. Whatever you do, DO WHAT MAKES YOU FEEL CLEAN, and hang on to that feeling as much as you can.\nNovelty.. Change what you do AS MUCH AS YOU CAN, all the time, every day. From where you go, who you talk to, the direction you take, the things you look at, what you talk about. Don’t do the same thing over and over again, that will put you to sleep and make life much easier for the parasites. Different clothes, different routines, different food, different screens, different EVERYTHING, as much as you can. You should notice it is very refreshing, very interesting, but your routines will fight you.. They need you to stay the same so the parasites can work, THEY HATE CHANGE.\nLastly.. should you choose to walk this path, then you need to accept one thing.. you cannot ‘manage’ your parasites and you cannot go back. See there are always more parasites, whole ant hills, wasp nests, rat holes full of them – its the typical state of normal folks without any class, gifted or not.\nThey have no value in the world – THEY ARE PARASITES, they survive eating others. Never feel bad about dealing harshly with them. Yes its hard, yes you will never be the same again but ultimately what do you expect – you have done this have you not, so it’s time you undid it. Again, parasites have no value in the natural world other than to clean up messes, is that all you are, a mess to be hoover up and replaced with a big pile of shit.. Ask yourself these questions often. If you just giggle like some little dork or street skank then I can’t help you – you ARE a parasite now. If you accept that you now know better, then I can. A very rock ‘n roll french lady I know invented a model, where she saw engaging with all her old parasites as like ‘drinking bleach’, which worked for her – that is how you need to see them, as if the next time you do them will KILL YOU, in a horribly painful fashion.\nTo end this section – understand the leaks associated with parasites and the normal leaks are different, and different methods are needed to deal with them. For normal leaks, a change of ‘attitude’, a ‘thought block’ can be used simply to stop thinking about it – a basic type of aversion therapy, like ‘this is just stupid’, and simply hang on to that thought until it goes away. Parasitic leaks are ‘insistent’, they are hard to stop because they have MUCH more weight to them in some fashion – you don’t just engage in them because you are bored, you have to do them, you have little choice in the matter, even if it is just a temporary anger/shock.\nIt’s a useful model to think of your leaks as actual little streams of water, flowing out of you but you will notice the leaks associated with parasites are MUCH stronger, faster, and harder to stop with simple thought-forms. Reasoning with strong anxieties in your mind for example does not tend to work, so you have to ignore them, wait them out. However, REALLY BIG AND BAD PARASITIC leaks will simply not give up at all. The key tells for this is that if you stop one ‘thought stream’, they will literally come back almost immediately, with a different tack, trying to push you into the same state of mind as before, often where you act negatively. For these it is IMPORTANT to ignore the approach that is being used, the ‘surface’ of it, and look only at what it is trying to do, its ‘end game’.\nYour change in attitude is all aimed at stopping that end game, no matter what the approach – to engage in the desired end aim is ‘its’ point/goal, it does not care how it tricks you into getting there, and in time you will start to be able to see it ‘coming’ – long before the end game becomes part of the thought stream, you will start to see that if you continue with this thought stream you will end up wanting a drink say, even though you actually don’t want one right now. This end game must be the point of your ‘drinking bleach’ aversion therapy.\nGifted people tend to have BIG leaks caused by BAD parasites, often multiple parasites working together, so getting used to the above is a very good idea. I’ll put some very good advice below on how to deal strongly with them below but for now, it is important to get an understanding in yourself of the type of ‘end game’ your parasites are looking for. These bad parasites ALWAYS use high emotional weight (emotion is a pure form of what it want’s from you), so the state of mind is very difficult to escape, as you notice when you try and fight them – you are typically either crushed or aroused by it, it is overwhelming.\nThe end game is always what you do as a result of these feelings that make them go away, reduces them, either that is an action (usually) or inaction/thought form – the end game is how you have learned to ‘feed the demon’, to get it off your back. That is what you need to stop or replace, and it is easy to know when you have found it – it will kick and scream like a spoilt child. It is a very useful thing when you first find these bad parasitic leaks in yourself to take a moment and say ‘I have NO interest in this, this is clearly not me, this is a parasite that is ON/IN ME’, separate it from yourself and identify it to yourself out loud – for many of you this will have quite a profound effect, see all PARASITES of any and all kind, HATE THE COLD LIGHT OF DAY, they live very secret little lives…\nSummary – The torture of parasitic behaviors is that they become real over time, become things in your mind, and over time will make you so weak you struggle even to fight them. So get mad and kill them in your mind – its not hard, as most parasites are little more than pond life. Indeed whenever you see a bug or a spider in real life MAKE A POINT OF KILLING IT YOURSELF, it will remind you to do it and reinforce the mental pattern. Yes, it’s nasty, uncomfortable but it’s meant to be – wake up you fool, IT WORKS, should you be gifted, USE IT. Try and remember that parasites NEED you to survive, if you don’t interact AT ALL with them they will die anyway – IGNORING PARASITES IS IN MANY WAYS THE BEST WAY TO KILL THEM, particularly if they come back.\nLastly (and this is a big lastly..) – it’s quite common to get a little ‘down’ when you start to ‘fight’ your parasites, as it appears to be a difficult thing. The reason for this is that you see it as a ‘FIGHT’ in the sense of a boxing match, of exchanging blows with an enemy over a long time. It’s not. Know that you have FAR MORE POWER THAN IT DOES (that’s why it wants you), and as soon as you spot it, and attack it wholeheartedly, with ‘rage’, you will win. You think this is a contest purely because in the past these parasites keep coming back, NOT because you lose this fight or that one with yourself. You should never lose a fight with yourself, BUT you must NEVER GO BACK, as that will actually make it worse than it was before – see it knows that you now know what it is too, but you are too weak to stop it.\nSo – if you are not yet strong enough and therefore can only ‘scuffle’ with your parasites at the moment then wait, bide your time until you are stronger or better placed. Then you END IT, YOU DON’T BOX THEM – HIT THEM ONCE, HIT THEM HARD, AND PUT THEM DOWN. If you are of the right temperament for this, it’s actually quite fun to do, once you get used to it – you actually go looking for it. It’s actually a great way to develop Power Over Yourself, and way better than the corrupted version of that, the power (you think you have) of being ‘Liked’. That’s a distortion of your true nature, a side road you took in the dark as a child – it’s time to start being liked because you are ‘worth’ liking, indeed ‘letting’ folks like you (by being nice to them) is actually an honor for them, NOT YOU. Use it amongst your own ‘kind’ ONLY, not parasites; with parasites, you kill them or ignore them (which is largely the same thing). If parasites can’t feed off you they die, it just takes a little longer.\nBut be clear, if you ‘think’ you are in a boxing match, you are struggling in a contest then you are already losing – wait until you have the strength to ‘execute it’, put it down. Exchanging blows of any kind, long, tedious, drawn-out, exhausting, is actually just another form of the same parasitic behavior, just another way to drain you. Like the desire to be ‘liked’, doing things to be liked, making a contest of it is already losing – it’s a gateway into these behaviors, it’s another trick to lead you down this same path, the path of the parasite…\nSO BE CLEAR – YOU DON’T FIGHT YOUR PARASITES IN THE BOXING RING, YOU KILL THEM, THEY ARE BUGS, INSIGNIFICANT CRITTERS OF THE TYPE YOU KILL HUNDREDS OF WITH YOUR CAR ON A SHORT SUMMER DRIVE WITHOUT EVEN BLOODY NOTICING.\nYou don’t fight a fly, an ant, a spider, a worm, do you? You don’t give it a little slap and then withdraw and circle around it waiting to see what it will do like some cartoon Ninja, do YOU? You JUST BLOODY CRUSH IT. Yes, you may need to watch it for a second, see what it does, how it moves, see-through its low-quality bullshit, but then you act, fast and hard. See you instinctively know that you have all the power and it has none in this scenario, all it can do is run.\nKnow why that is? It’s because you are way BIGGER than it is, and as in any challenge in your life, your perception of its size relative to you is EVERYTHING. So make yourself BIG and it small, tiny even, turn it into something funny, pathetic, mock it, ignore it – it’s an insect! You have made it big by adding emotional value as ‘size’ to it, fear, hate or love, and now you ‘look up to it’. Stop that shit by using the mechanism that was hard-wired into from birth; devalue it, cut it down to size by getting MAD AT IT – how DARE this insignificant piece of crap or thought try and fuck with my life! Then see it shrink up in your mind, and watch it crawl away to die with a smile on your face. This is what ‘correct’ anger does, it makes you BIGGER, emotionally, even in your mind’s eye you should try and ‘rise up’ above it all, see it in ‘map view’, so don’t be afraid to use it when you need it.\nThis is actually what the ‘anger reflex’ is for – to revalue your relative values so they suit you, not ‘them’ – to help you change your circumstances by making you, temporarily, stronger emotionally. However try not to do it all the time, there is a high cost to it in terms of your gift, cost of your Being, so keep it for the important stuff – don’t get mad at inanimate objects or animals like any simple fool who miss uses this reflex, use it ‘on purpose’ or not all. Instead, use the halfway house version for normal stuff, make things you don’t like smaller in your mind’s eye, make them black and white, shrink them, make them pathetic – cause they are. You will find this makes you far more confident dealing with challenges in this life, you will become naturally far ‘braver’. Practice this technique often, even when you don’t need to, start to look down on ‘normal’ life, not up to it.\nTo repeat – Be BIGGER than it, don’t grovel like a worm on the ground – know that there are many things in this world that it’s far ‘better to die trying’, than simply accept as a ‘fact of your life’…\nYou should really start to understand how to do this now… see, as any gangster will tell you, it actually IS about the ‘size’ of the Dog in the fight that matters, should you be gifted. But in your ‘real life’ you have forgotten this, forgotten ‘what’ you are, how ‘big’ you are, so it’s time to start remembering ‘what’ you are, and also who ‘they’ are, the insects of the world and your mind. Upscale yourself and downscale your problems, NOT THE OTHER WAY ROUND, then all this stuff (and much more besides) gets a lot easier…\nIf you are NOT yet a parasite yourself you know this is right, and I know it works, but you HAVE TO DO IT, to try hard, to commit to it. However, if you are a parasite (if you feel like you are being forced to read this through fear usually) then you should not bother – frankly, you don’t really matter much anyway, do you… you are little more than a shadow on a wall, you only exist because of others.\nTo note – I know many of you will feel this method is a little puerile, infantile, feel silly doing it. Know why? You have yet to accept that the world of spirit is a jungle, that there are no police to deter your attackers, and there is little point in calling ghostbusters… Again, you have been fooled since school, taught the illusion of civilization, of society as a model of safety and goodness.. It is total nonsense, and the last time you actually ‘knew’ that was when you were a child, so don’t get confused – it’s a GOOD thing you find these methods childish, as that was the last time that most of you knew what it meant to be a warrior, rather than a soldier. You think you are ‘safe’ just walking around, nothing is going to hurt you – you are wrong and it’s made you soft, unprepared for real life.\nNever forget this – civilization as you know it was invented by the Greeks and Romans, and they did not even bother with police, with ‘deterrents’, they knew it was an illusion – they had bodyguards, and I mean everyone had them, cause they would not last long without them. Even the infamous, the all-powerful, the sacrosanct ‘Tribune of the Plebs’ and all-round BADASS Mark Anthony knew, on his way to the forum that day, that much as he was totally safe strolling down the street as his reputation, legal status, and huge nearby army would deter any attackers, but best take 100 veteran legionaries just be sure… So when the mob actually did attack him out of the blue he was able to DEFEND HIMSELF.\nI want you to get this point but it’s hard to teach, so try this…. Today we believe we are protected by Society, by the State, so our mental state has degenerated as we no longer have to manage the real possibility of imminent death, the only real ‘fear’ there is. Yes – the purpose of the powerful feeling of fear is ‘fear of death’, it has no other real ‘meaning’. But now it is corrupted – we are afraid of EVERYTHING because we no longer have the reference point of the ‘fear of death’ so tiny things build into ‘fears’, our value system is turned on its head, we no longer know the actual point of fear, so we fear a bad review at work, we fear the fucking weather. We are weaker, apathetic, stuck in our heads, living our lives in a trance. Our main value reference for life has gone, so there has never been more mental illness, more unhappiness, more creepy and obsessional behavior, more brain rot. We are worse off than our ancestors, we do less, live less, understand less than they did.\nNow we believe in the utter trivia of identity, of politics, of social justice as the ’cause celeb’ of this day or that one, because we have forgotten all the actually important stuff, at least until we get on our deathbed. This removal of any ‘fear of death’ from our developmental arc, from our value system, means we are rudderless, it means we no longer accept or even really take any ‘risks’ with our lives, so most of us barely live at all – our risks today are little more than office politics, hook up culture and watching ‘dodgy’ porn. This has turned us into robots, into cowards, taking drugs and watching life through a screen, acting out life as a computer game, pretending to be cool in the fucking Metaverse… in which ‘we’ take no part. You would never actually shoot anyone would you? Yet half of you spend your life playing 1st person shooter games, pretending to kill literally hundreds of other human beings every day, ‘pretend fighting’ like children did 100 years ago, like it’s fucking NORMAL for adults to do it. See 100 years ago children grew up, stopped pretending, grew some balls, joined the army, and went and did it for fucking real…\nThe realization above is really what this is all about – helping you understand that you HAVE TO REMEMBER HOW TO FIGHT, spiritually speaking, how to survive, how to win, accept it as NORMAL, part of life, you actually WANT TO DO IT BECAUSE YOU SEE HOW IMPORTANT IT IS. You must understand that your Parasites are NOT YOU, you must understand they are feeding off you, you must understand you have to stop them, and you must learn ‘how’ to fight back. The main reason most of you have so many parasites is that you have simply forgotten how to do this, indeed you have forgotten that you even need to. Your ancestors understood this naturally, developed in childhood as a mental state through the real fear of death. You don’t, so you have to learn from scratch – you must learn the ‘attitude’ of a fighter, of a warrior, it is that simple, YOU MUST LEARN TO BE ‘ON GUARD’.\nSo what is the attitude of a fighter, you say? Ahh ok then, it is this – stop ‘accepting’ what you don’t like, don’t want, don’t care about because it’s become normal for you, it’s become a habit. Break the spell of it, it’s an illusion – Question and Reject it, ‘stand your ground’, and literally say ‘Not Now’. That’s it – ‘Fight It’. Everything else follows that, is caused by that change. The feeling of ‘attention you get as a victim’ is nothing after you have experienced the power to choose – back 100 years ago it is what they used to call ‘Growing Up’. If you don’t make this change you become someone who is just pleased to get through the day without too much trouble, a slave who accepts their lot and ‘copes’. And that is for farm animals, livestock. That all you are?\nTo be a fighter is to live, pure and simple. Now, it is easy to understand conceptually that Fear of Death keeps you alive, that it teaches you to recognize and deal with predators, with parasites, and this lack of Fear of Death turns you into a delusion pussy. The problem is understanding that fear of anything else other than death, fear of getting a speeding ticket, fear of your affairs going bad, fear of losing your job, fear of the unknown future even, is TOTALLY FAKE – its a device being used on you by Parasites, it is unreal. You only fall for this con job because you have forgotten there is only really one fear, and what that real fear actually feels like.\nTry and give this some thought, because in all truth I tell you this – LEARN TO USE YOUR FEAR AS MOTIVATION TO FIGHT THEM. Not because of the ‘content’ of the particular fear ‘they’ are using on you (that’s all fake), but because its a way of recognizing what they are doing right now – PARASITES ACTUALLY SEEK YOUR SLOW DEATH VIA FEEDING OFF YOU THROUGH FAKE FEAR. See, now you can use the real Fear of Death to start actually living – remind yourself what fear of actual death feels like, then learn to recognize the feeling of fake fear intellectually. See, mental Anxiety ‘attacks’, however bad, are not real Fear, they are the fake fear of ‘not death’. You must reject the content of this fake fear but use it as a trigger to fear ‘fear itself’, NOT the content of that fake fear, as its bollocks. Behind that fake fear there is actually something you NEED TO DEAL WITH, a parasite, and parasites in the spiritual sense of it actually are DEATH. Get this – the real Fear of Death is an ‘instinct’, it is natural, essential even, BUT fear of clowns is an unreal emotion and is just bloody stupid. OBVIOUSLY. Why would you fall for it? LAUGH AT IT.\nThat is what that old saying really means, and it will help motivate you to ‘see’ and then ‘kill’ them quickly. Killing your parasites with confidence is one of the best feelings in the world, it’s at the heart of developing Power Over Yourself – once you get started you will actually want to do it more and more. See, if you ‘see’ it this way then KILLING PARASITES THEMSELVES IS REALLY BLOODY EASY, cause they are just little insects, (‘see’ them as tiny little bugs), the fear they cause is ALL FAKE (‘see’ yourself as massive by comparison to this fear, mock it, even mock ‘yourself’ for feeling it). Get it now?\nIn the end it’s easy to do, getting rid of your parasites, but as one last piece of advice, given all the advice, motivation and method above is this – for the weaker amongst you, it is best to identify and keep ‘1’ comforting behavior and get rid of all the rest. This will get you past the whole inability to start things, give you some momentum. Just remember to make sure that comforting behavior DOES NOT INVOLVE ANYONE ELSE DIRECTLY and that the only thing you should ‘instinctively’ be scared of is death. For the gifted ‘smoking’ is probably the no1 choice, but get rid of that too when you can.\nAsk Yourself OFTEN – is this ‘fear’ going to kill me right now? No? Well, fuck it then….\nRemember that all parasitic people are REALLY not scary, they are dependent, like drug addicts, little more than tiny little sea creatures floating by, grabbing on to whatever shiny and powerful thing passes by, living out lives of quiet desperation at best and at worst… well, just one more mental health statistic. Whatever happens to them afterward is not your fault, so move on. NEVER PITY YOUR PARASITES, NEVER EXCUSE THEM, NEVER FEEL SORROW FOR THEM – THAT IS THE PATH TO BECOMING ONE YOURSELF. Yes, in a very real sense they are mentally ill, but know they are coping with that mental disease BY GIVING IT TO YOU, so you suffer instead of them. They don’t care what happens to you, do they? Return that favour, in spades, with bells on – be polite if you wish, but never apologize to or for them, they are nasty little animals, let ‘nature’ take its course, or get others to help you.\nAhhh, you say, ‘but what if I’ve been forced to become a parasite to survive, what if I now bitterly regret all of it? It’s really no fun anymore, I’ve become a criminal, I’m getting old, ugly and sick, I see things at night, have bad dreams and I’m scared all the time!’, you say. Yep, that is a special case, but the advice is the same as above – GET RID OF YOUR OWN PARASITES FIRST. Then reach out, admit it, come ‘clean’ and get some help. Don’t lie to yourself that ‘no one knows’, don’t get stuck in the ‘secret life’ trap – the delusion that you even have one keeps so many otherwise gifted folks too dependent or scared to change, it’s almost epidemic. Walk away, or get help to walk away – don’t be pathetic, that is precisely what your parasites rely on, so many gifted make this mistake but it doesn’t really matter.\nYep, start to see all this as a rite of passage for the unschooled gifted, nature is giving you one last wake-up call, the hard way. Frankly, it’s not even that interesting – most people’s ‘desperate situations’ are little more in type than some 10y/o bully demanding your lunch money, in the context of what is actually ‘out there’. Once you start to change you will start to understand this is ALL TRIVIA in comparison to what is to come, you will look back and piss yourself laughing, amazed that you gave more than 5 seconds thought to it. Sure it’s all ‘Kill or be Killed’ right now, but hey you are killing bugs, you a grown-up and they are BUGS! So not that hard in the end then. Indeed in time it will be so easy you will feel a little ‘demeaned’ by doing it, like it’s ‘beneath you’ – when you actually have some ‘Game’, some depth, some sophistication, some level of self-reflection that isn’t driven by terror, then all of this is actually so predictable it’s quite amusing. And that is a REALLY good sign.\nStill not sure if you ‘are’ a parasite or just became one to survive? Ahhh.. that is easy – if you got into ‘it’ because it was special, it was crazy fun, a whole other level from anything else you have ever known, (you are simply reading this to prepare an excuse cause you are scared shitless people know), then you’re a parasite, so good luck with that. Go eat your emotions like the chubby little farm animal you are, but know ‘it always comes around’ in the end. If, however, you needed to JUSTIFY what you did, ‘(‘it was them NOT me’), if you had to invent ‘blame’ in order to cope with it, then there is hope. A great key indicator for a ‘survivor parasite’, is that you ‘love’ your pets (more than anyone else), they are not just company, you are devoted to them, they help you cope with it all. Real parasites tend to NOT have pets, even if they pay lip service to liking them – animals don’t keep other animals as pets. BUT, to move on you must drop all that fake justification and realize it was your ‘needs’ that ‘drove’ you to it – you have lied to yourself for convenience, to help you sleep, it’s all total bollocks because you lost your way and you are just trying to stay sane now. Question is, can you see that and can you stop.\nAhhh, maybe you need to ‘get a bit older’ first, maybe get some good strong pills to dull the panic attacks, or maybe you need to get some permanent disease, the kind you have to tell people at your next job. Do you need to see yourself in the mirror again? Think I’m joking? Maybe go look now then eh, see the mess you are, given what you used to be, see yourself slowly becoming plain, your eyes, your skin – you are becoming a monster… Ready yet?\nSo get on with it. Now. Use the methods above, Be a fighter, be a gangster even. BUT ABOVE ALL ELSE – STOP BEING NICE TO PARASITES, it will attract whole ‘legions’ of them (that’s what the New Testament line means), so it’s the Kiss Of Death. FIGHT. Sure, society has made you into a pussy so you hate confrontation, so start with ‘Not Today’ to your pointless fake fears, start with ignoring it. I once knew a committed ‘people pleaser’ who HAD to start with still saying yes, but then simply not doing it, not showing up, and then quietly explaining afterward that he changed his mind, but ‘thanks for the opportunity. Once you get going you will find the ‘rage’ response is INVALUABLE – that is what it is designed for, to give you the power in the moment to change, to stop, to say ‘No, I don’t care, and I’m not doing this shit anymore’, publish and be damned.\nAccept the bad things are GOING TO HAPPEN ANYWAY, you can’t stop them BUT they won’t be that bad, see this imagined ‘huge degree’ of bad as a ‘result’ is a major part of the illusion – most folks bad stuff is little more than plucking an eyebrow hair than some imagined medieval torture, which almost never happens. A lot of bad things are simply CHANGE, and those changes do really NEED to happen, so look for the change even, just try not to call it ‘bad’, get used to some change in your life, will toughen you the fuck up, and will destroy any hold petty fears have over you even bloody more…\nJust use all of this for some purpose, to move on. Your life will only really start on the other side of these fake fears when they have popped like so many little soap bubbles. Indeed, should you be gifted, you will BENEFIT MASSIVELY FROM THIS CONSERVATION OF YOURSELF, maybe even start to use it on ‘yourself’, should you ‘care’ about yourself. If you are a parasite? Then you will burn, the loss of the magic that keeps you alive will hurt, but hey, you are going to burn anyway, you are a parasite – by definition, no one cares, not even you, because you are ‘insignificant’, so you are ‘desperate’ to have power, be clever, be cool, be ANYTHING, that’s ‘why’ you are a parasite.\nNow, I always end this lesson with one real-life example quote, that so shocked me at the time that it struck me as the ultimate level of understanding you need to do this. Long ago, an American lady I was teaching said this, (paraphrased): ‘I know they are parasites and they have to go but, really, I find it so hard to follow through with it – they LOVE ME SO MUCH, GIVE ME SO MUCH ATTENTION, it’s very hard to turn my back on them…’.\nIf you take nothing else away from this 16,000-word post, take this – YOUR PARASITES FUCKING LOATHE YOU, ALL OF THEM, ALL THE TIME, AT THE HIGHEST POSSIBLE LEVEL OF RELIGOUS BIGOTRY YOU CAN EVER IMAGINE. They would step over you in the street and spit on your corpse – we are not talking hatred here, oh no, NO they LOATHE YOU at a visceral level, you make their ‘skin crawl’ when they have finished with you.\nSee, you actually make them ‘nothing’, by comparison, and they can never forgive you for that – the only friendships you EVER really have are with your equals, NOT parasites… YOUR PARASITES ARE A CANCER INSIDE YOU, AND EVERY DAY YOU KEEP THEM IT GETS WORSE AND WORSE, THEY DESPISE YOU MORE AND MORE, SO THEY TAKE, MORE AND MORE. PARASITES ALWAYS ‘ESCALATE’ BECAUSE OF THIS, SO YOU GET MORE AND MORE LETHARGIC, UNTIL ONE DAY YOU ARE TOO WEAK TO EVEN TRY.\nSee – you are BETTER than them, they NEED you, you SHAME them, DESTROY their self-image every time they engage with you. You remind them what an insignificant piece of shit they are, how weak, stupid and disturbed they are – THEY DESPISE YOU FOR IT, AND THERE IS NOTHING YOU CAN DO ABOUT IT. It is a fundamental part of the ‘transactional’ nature of your relationship with parasites, however ‘good’ to you they appear to be. They may even seem to help you but it is an illusion, like all the other illusions and petty deceits parasites need to exist, don’t fall for it. They are laughing ‘at’ you and cursing you, because you actually fall for it BY BEING FUCKING NICE, you fool.\nTrue Parasites don’t suffer from bad ‘conscience’, like the gifted ‘survivor parasite’, as they don’t have one – a conscience is a precious thing in the world of spirit, be glad of it, be GLAD THAT IT MEANS YOU HAVE SOME LEVEL OF GIFT. They, on the other hand, are fucking animals – animals don’t have a conscience, their ‘regret’ is just ‘fear of being found out’, their ‘guilt’ is to remind themselves what they should feel for PR purposes, their unhappiness is little more than their ever-darkening night terrors and depression, some even try and amuse themselves by feeling ‘pity’ for you, which is just another desperate way of trying to feel superior to you, as you make them feel VERY inferior. You cannot fix a true parasite, and they are not worth fixing even if you could – write them off and wash your hands afterward, shit sticks. Never hate a true parasite, they are not worthy of even that but feel free to HATE THE GIFTED PARASITES, as some might even understand why – it might help them wake the fuck up.\nStarting to change your mind about your parasites yet? Think you can still manage them, even keep them on the down-low? No? So you finally understand they need to go?\nGood, as know that the ONLY REALLY PROBLEM WITH DEALING WITH THEM IS AT THE BLOODY START. See, once you start to recognize and identify your parasites, literally ‘call’ them that, treat them like parasites, many of the small ones will disappear BY THEMSELVES as many of you have enough power for that to work. I don’t want to give you false hope however, as the gifted tend to have BAD parasites as they are way ‘tastier’ than normal folks, and the bad ones have to be ‘removed’ or they will come back. However, for the smaller ones the light of consciousness will destroy many unconscious habits, public shame is still very powerful against many who are otherwise publically ‘good’ too, plus other negative ‘things’ will come along and ‘happen’ to them, they will even fight amongst themselves, accusing the ‘competition’, which can be bloody hilarious to watch… but the first few dominoes will still need to be ‘pushed’ over, by you.\nThe last word – it’s important not to get delusional with parasites, not to identify things as parasites unless you are sure, which always comes from the proof that they are trying to control you – parasites are never passive, never disinterested. Parasites seek to use the power they have over you through deceit, but stuff that you give power to, often blaming them for not doing something or simply by being stupid, is not a parasite – indeed it is more than likely YOU are a gifted parasite in this case. After control parasites always try and appear powerful, all-knowing, all-seeing, and usually scary. Know that, in reality, you have all the power, NOT them, they are nothing, tiny, you are massive, as that is the reason you actually have parasites in the first place. See actual parasites NEVER have parasites themselves, there is literally nothing there to ‘eat’, they are empty vessels, so they are very lonely and need to control you. ITS ALL ABOUT ACTIVE CONTROL and the sense of significance that gives animal parasites, without which they are nothing…\nQuote to end as always – ahh we will go modern for this one, how about one of my favorite films, the Outlaw Josey Wales from 1976 no less.. Clint at the peak of his powers..\n‘Now remember, when things look bad and it looks like you’re not gonna make it, then you gotta get mean. I mean plumb, mad-dog mean. Cause if you lose your head and you give up then you neither live nor win. That’s just the way it is..’ Josey Wales, before the enemy attack the family in the cabin.", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

{"id": "5024", "text": "“The best definition I know for contemplation is as follows: Contemplation is a long, loving look at what really is…\nWe have to find a place where we can receive all of our experiences without repressing anything. We need a place where we can consider all that we’ve done –and not done–in our life, a place that’s bigger than Yes and No, a place bigger than the judgements we pass. At this all embracing place God becomes quite clear. Here there is room for every part of you and for God’s presence…\nI’m sure that most people in the Western world have never really met the person who they themselves really are. Because at every moment, all our life long, we identify ourselves either with our thoughts, our self-image, or our feelings. We have to find a way to get behind our thoughts, feelings and self-image. We have to discover the face that we already had before we were born. We have to find out who we were all along in God before we did anything right or wrong. This is the first goal of contemplation.\nI ask you to imagine a river or stream. You’re sitting on the bank of this river, where boats and ships are sailing past. While the stream flows past your inner eye, I ask you to name each one of these vessels. For example, one of the boats may be called “my anxiety about tomorrow.” Or along comes the ship “objections to my husband,” or the boat “Oh, I don’t do that well.” Every judgement that you pass is one of those boats. Take the time to give each one of them a name, and then let it move on.\nFor some people this is a very difficult exercise, because we’re used to jumping aboard the boats immediately. As soon as we own a boat, and identify with it, it picks up energy. But what we have to practice is un-possessing, letting go. With every idea, with every image that comes into our head we say, “No, I’m not that; I don’t need that; that’s not me.” Again and again we have to tell ourselves this. Some of the boats that are accustomed to our jumping aboard them immediately think we just didn’t see them the first time. That’s why they head back upstream and return. The boat says: “But before this he always used to get mad at his wife. Why didn’t he this time?” Some of you will feel the need to torpedo your boats. But don’t attack them. Don’t hate or condemn them: this is also an exercise in nonviolence. You aren’t allowed to hate your soul. The point is to recognize things and to say, “That’s not necessary; I don’t need that.” But do it very amiably. If we learn to handle our own souls tenderly and lovingly, then we’ll be able to carry this same loving wisdom into the world outside…\nPsychology can only help us to arrange our images somewhat differently, to get a somewhat more positive image of ourselves. But authentic spirituality not only shifts the image, it says, “I don’t need any images at all; I don’t have to protect any self-image.” If you see this exercise through, in a short time you’ll know which images you personally cling to, which patterns of thought energize you. I warn you, it’s a humiliating experience at first, because most people will find out that they don’t know who they are apart from their thoughts and feelings. But after only a few minutes some will find that the river is cleared of boats. Occasionally it even happens that people have the feeling that they’d love to tear their clothes off and dive into the river. The water is our spiritual self that flows much deeper than our psyche.\nBonaventure says, “Being and goodness are one and the same thing.” That’s why we have to return to the level where we simply “are,” where we’re naked, and where we experience how inherently good we are, yet paradoxically that goodness has nothing to do with my own performance. It is a total unearned gift. We have to return to this place; otherwise there will never be any radical reformation of religion, nor will there be any true politics. There will only be one ego warring against another. An ego with a right-wing ideology is just as bad as an ego with a left-wing ideology. A capitalist ego is just as bad as a communist ego. Genuine religion leads us beyond these egocentric attitudes and helps us see who we are in God… We don’t have to prove anything, we don’t have to defend anything, and we return from this place to the world with greater strength…\nFor this reason I ask you now simply to sit in silence for six minutes. With this exercise there is no such thing as success or failure. The important thing is to see it though and to keep letting go of the unnecessary false self– and not to be afraid.\nBecause being and goodness are identical. The goal of all spirituality is that in the end the naked person stands before the naked God. The important thing is that we’re naked. As you know, the act of lovemaking requires nakedness. And the same is true of loving God. We have to cast off our false self to be ready for real unity with God.\n…the purpose of this new liberation from bondage is so I can commit myself from free and healthy motives. The effect of contemplation is authentic action, and if contemplation doesn’t lead to authentic action, then it remains only navel-gazing and self-preoccupation.\nBut I’m convinced that if you stick with it, if you do this exercise regularly, then you will come to the inner place of compassion… At this point you’re indestructible, because there you find the peace that the world cannot give. You don’t need to win anymore; you just need to do what you have to do, as simplistic and naive as that might sound… People who are living from a truly God-centered place instead of a self-centered place are dangerously free precisely because they are tethered at the center.”\nby Richard Rohr, Simplicity pages 92-99", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}

{"id": "5050", "text": "High-resolution, fish tooth Nd isotopic records for eight Deep Sea Drilling Project and Ocean Drilling Program sites were used to reconstruct the nature of late Paleocene-early Eocene deep-water circulation. The goal of this reconstruction was to test the hypothesis that a change in thermohaline circulation patterns caused the abrupt 4-5°C warming of deep and bottom waters at the Paleocene/Eocene boundary - the Paleocene-Eocene thermal maximum (PETM) event. The combined set of records indicates a deep-water mass common to the North and South Atlantic, Southern and Indian oceans characterized by mean εNd values of ∼ -8.7, and different water masses found in the central Pacific Ocean (εNd ∼ -4.3) and Caribbean Sea (εNd ∼ 1.2). The geographic pattern of Nd isotopic values before and during the PETM suggests a Southern Ocean deep-water formation site for deep and bottom waters in the Atlantic and Indian ocean basins. The Nd data do not contain evidence for a change in the composition of deep waters prior to the onset of the PETM. This finding is consistent with the pattern of warming established by recently published stable isotope records, suggesting that deep- and bottom-water warming during the PETM was gradual and the consequence of surface-water warming in regions of downwelling.\nAll Science Journal Classification (ASJC) codes\n- Geochemistry and Petrology\n- Earth and Planetary Sciences (miscellaneous)\n- Space and Planetary Science", "scores": {"score": 3, "score_transform_1": 5, "score_transform_2": 5, "score_transform_3": 0}}

Perhaps it stems from a fundamental aspect of our investor psychology—the risk-takers in us who crave fast profit. There are five essential strategies for doubling your money, including diversifying your portfolio and investing in speculative goods.\nIn general, investing almost double your income can be done securely over several years or rapidly, although those who are impatient run the danger of losing most or all of their money.\nHowever, doubling your capital is a reasonable goal that any investor should strive for. There are five ways to get there in general. So let’s talk about that.\nJohn Houseman “they make money the old fashioned way—they earn it.”\nThat advertising isn’t too far off the mark when it regards to the most traditional method of doubling your money.\nInvesting in a strong, non-speculative portfolio that is varied between blue-chip companies and investment bonds is a tried-and-true strategy to double your money in a fair amount of time. Of course, it won’t double in a year, but given the 72-hour rule, it should eventually.\n“Buy when there is blood in the streets, even if it is their own blood,” says Baron Rothschild.\nOnly the most conservative investor understands that there exists a significant moment when you must purchase, not because everyone else is doing so, but because everyone else is selling.\nOtherwise strong company’s share prices occasionally go through slumps, which intensify as fickle investors bailout, much as great athletes go through slumps when many spectators turn their backs.\nNobody is advising you to invest in rubbish stocks. On the contrary, the idea is that strong assets can get overvalued at times, which creates a purchasing opportunity for investors who have done their due diligence.\n“Never Invest in a Business You Can’t Understand” Warren Buffet\nThere are rapid and slow methods to double your money, just as there are fast and slow ways to travel to the same destination on the highway. Bonds can be a less nerve-wracking ride to the same destination if you prefer to play it safe. Take zero-coupon bonds, such as traditional U.S. savings bonds.\nZero-coupon bonds may appear scary to the uninformed. In truth, they’re easy to comprehend. You acquire a bond at a discount to its ultimate value at maturity rather than a bond that pays you a monthly interest payment.\n“An important key to investing is to remember that stocks are not lottery tickets” Peter Lynch\nWhile some investors prefer to take it slow and steady, others find themselves struggling. Options, leverage trading, or penny stocks may be the quickest way for these people to boost their savings. Unfortunately, everyone has the ability to rapidly deplete a savings account.\nShares options, like call and put options, can be used to trade on the stock of any business.

However, this dreary scene is slowly changing. Today Novi Sad and other parts of Serbia are becoming more accepting of the gay community, and very slowly, people are coming out proud with pride events.\nYou will be glad to know that even if this conservative country still has a way to go, you will find most people in Novi Sad extremely welcoming to all that grace their streets, with a loud and proud gay community not going silently back into the closet any longer.\nOutside her gay clubs, festivals and bar, Novi Sad is better known to the rest of the world as the host of the yearly EXIT Festival, one of the most significant musical events in Europe, and her thriving young population and pumping nightlife. So, a trip to this place will be one where a night out will always be exciting.\nThere is also their long history of being a settlement along the Danube, having seen the Roman Empire rise and fall, the Medieval Kingdoms, and the modern age becoming known as Europe’s capital of culture.\nYou can make the most of these endless cultural attractions or head out into the beautiful lands of the Serbian countryside, taking in the stretching beauty of the Danube River or getting a good look from the peak of Mount Fruška Gora. You need not look far to find something exceptional on a gay trip to Novi Sad.\nIn this article we will cover...\nAttractions in Gay Novi Sad, Serbia\nHoney, welcome to Gay Novi Sad! Now, let’s spill the tea – this city may not be the most welcoming to our rainbow community, but don’t let that dim your sparkle! There are still plenty of fabulous things to see and do here, no matter who you love.\nAs passionate travelers and members of the LGBTQ+ community, we believe that queer travel is not only about having fun and exploring new places but also about promoting cultural understanding and spreading pride.\nThrough the journey, we can learn about different cultures, histories, and perspectives and share our experiences and identities with others. We can also support LGBTQ+ businesses and organizations and work together to create a safer and more accepting world for all members of our rainbow family.\nUnfortunately, homophobia and discrimination still exist in many parts of the world, and it is important to be mindful of the laws, customs, and attitudes of the places we visit.\nBut by being visible and proud and by supporting local LGBTQ+ communities and allies, we can help to change hearts and minds and make a positive impact wherever we go. So let’s keep exploring, learning, and sharing, and continue to work towards a future where all travelers can feel safe and celebrated, no matter where they are.\nCheck out the iconic landmarks and attractions, darling. Visit those historical monuments, museums, and art galleries like the true cultural connoisseur you are.\nAnd, of course, let’s not forget about the architecture, parks, and gardens. Trust us, the local cuisine will leave you gagging, and the markets are to die for. And, girl, let’s not even start on the cultural events like festivals, concerts, and shows – they are simply sickening!\nNow, while we are out and proud queens, we have to keep it on the down-low when we hit the streets, sis. Sadly, this city may not be as welcoming to us as we’d like. But no worries, we’ll just have to slay discreetly, okay? Let’s show these locals how to live our best lives, honey!\nDiscover the cultural heritage and beautiful landscapes of Northern Serbia on this tour of Sremski Karlovci and Novi Sad. You be able to see first-hand the Petrovaradin Fortress along the Danube and so much more, with the highlight of this whole experience being that you are led the entire way by entertaining guides and a fun-filled itinerary.\nThe most famous drawer to Novi Sad is the biggest music festival in the region, EXIT. Experience some of the best music from around the world in a lively several-day celebration with hundreds of performers like Illy Allen and Placebo, with many more fresh names and old faces waiting for the crowds to get wild.\nFruška Gora National Park is a site to visit if your best holiday involves endless hiking opportunities with great mountain peaks to get great views of Novi Sad and Northern Serbia. You will be mesmerized by the forests, orchards, and fields while treated to enchanting wildlife. Plus, with walks for all levels, both flat and incline hikes, this is a decent decision for all gay travelers.\nSerbian National Theatre\nSpend a night at the opera at the Serbian National Theatre, which plays out of their 19th-century building. You may be in town when they have their annual Sterijino Pozorje, a pretentious event in Serbia that celebrates their art over a few days, where groups compete to see who is the best in their field.\nMonument to the Victims of the Raid\nErected in 1971, this monument by Jovan Soldatović is dedicated to the victims of World War Two with the names of victims from the 1942 January Raid. It is a reminder of this terrible time on Raid Quay along the riverbank with a riverside park open to all to come and remember those lost and celebrate the area’s transformed beauty today.\nMuseum of Vojvodina\nOne of the largest museums in Novi Sad is the Museum of Vojvodina, with over 400,000 artifacts in its collection and a wide range of exhibits to get you up close and personal with the city’s history. The building is also a marvel; you can get lost in its galleries or expansive park.\nNovi Sad resides along Europe’s second longest river, the Danube, which is a treat to visit for those after a little break in nature. Not only is it the backdrop to some of their famous cultural heritage sites like the Petrovaradin Fortress, but numerous parks and riverbank walks close to the city, which makes it easy to stretch your legs even without a car to travel outside the city to their national park.\nWhen visiting Liberty Square, a great place to visit is the Tanurdžić’s Palace which is not a royal palace in the traditional sense but a 1930s building for a prominent merchant Nikola Tanurdžić who built it to serve multipurpose options.\nIt was the site of the first city’s cinema in 1939, and until the end of World War Two, it was the family home of Nikola Tanurdžić until he was evicted and the palace was turned over to the city.\nThe Gallery of Matica Srpska\nTake on one of the best art collections in Novi Sad at the Gallery of Matica Srpska, where you will encounter a rich collection of 18th – 20th-century Serbian artworks and a wide range of modern and international pieces.\nBe blown away by their permanent collection to become acquainted with Serbian art, and then check out their latest temporary show that could include famous pieces you’ve always wanted to see in person. This is a great way to fill in an afternoon on a lousy day or to get a taste of Serbian art.\nFound in Petrovaradin (part of Novi Sad), the iconic Fortress shares its name, although it is also known as the Gibraltar of the Danube because it resides along the river’s bank. This structure was built in the 17th century as a military defense during the Austrian-Turkish wars. However, its site has archaeology unrelated to the fort that dates back to settlement in the area at 19,000 – 15,000 BC.\nDive underground and see a little bit of the dark, morbid side of Novi Sad at the Petrovaradin Catacombs found beneath the local fortress. These military galleys are not, in the traditional sense, burial catacombs, despite their name. Instead, you will find up to ten miles of winding pathways with different artifacts. You may encounter masonic symbols in one part and Kaiser Well in another.\nName of Mary Catholic Church\nBuilt-in the 19th century, the Name of Mary Catholic Church is a central meeting point of spiritual life in Novi Sad and a delightful building to gaze at! Its Gothic Revival spire pierces the cityscape as a beacon for visitors to enter her sanctuary or wander around her spacious exterior at Liberty Square.\nIn the center of Novi Sad Liberty Square is her main square, dividing up the busy streets with delightful seating and excellent attractions. It is bordered by beautiful buildings ranging from the Mary Catholic Church standing front in center to the Tanurdžić’s Palace and the oldest hotel in the region Vojvodina Hotel.\nThen if that wasn’t all, in the center of the square is a bronze statue of Svetozar Miletic, a former mayor of the city who was foundational to the city you see today.\nGay-Friendly & Gay Hotels in Novi Sad, Serbia\nDon’t wait another minute to book your stay at one of the most fabulously queer-friendly hotels in Novi Sad! While many establishments in town might not welcome our rainbow family, these hotels have all pledged to embrace our queer spirit with open arms.\nFrom non-discrimination policies to LGBTQ+ resources and amenities, these hotels go above and beyond to create a safe and inclusive environment for all guests who identify as LGBTQ+.

However, remember that these venues can differ in terms of vibe, patrons, and rules, so it’s a good idea to be informed before you dive in.\nGay saunas, sex clubs, and cruising have long been popular ways for queer men to meet and engage in sexual activity, particularly in countries where same-sex activity is not widely accepted or may even be illegal. In these places, gay saunas and cruising clubs provide a safe and discreet environment for queer men to explore their sexuality and connect with like-minded individuals.\nDespite the rise of gay dating apps, many queer men still prefer the anonymity and physical connection that can be found in these spaces – so somewhat counter-intuitively, you might have a hotter experience here than you would at home.\nWe recommend checking out our guide to cruising for first-timers before you get started, which should give you the lowdown, and always practice safe sex. Keep in mind that local laws and customs regarding gay venues and sexual activity should always be respected.\nWith a bit of forethought and an open mind, visiting gay saunas and cruising clubs can be a thrilling and steamy part of your gay Novi Sad adventure.\nGay Map Of Novi Sad\nFinding it hard to envisage where everything is in Novi Sad?

{"id": "5069", "text": "This Bastard is Too Competent Chapter 46 - Finally Found Out\nKaran, whose gagged mouth had loosened from struggling desperately, cried out, but Ian paid no heed.\nThe woman scoffed at the sight.\n“As expected of a descendant of Kaistein. You are so wicked for coveting your own interests before the lives of your subordinates.”\nIt would be appropriate to say that bloodthirst gushed from her eyes.\nNo, it wasn’t just bloodthirst.\n“Kill him. I have nothing more to say to that jerk.”\nAs soon as the woman’s words fell, the bartender holding Karan hostage moved.\nTheir purpose was not Karan but Ian.\nAnd now, Ian had neither Galon nor guards to protect him.\nKaran panicked and tried to move the chair.\nWith Ian’s gesture, the cloak grew in size and blocked the opponent.\nThe cloak tied the bartender’s limbs as if sucking in and entangling them.\nWhile the bartender who was overwhelmed in an instant couldn’t move, Ian drew his sword and threw it.\nAnd the sword that escaped from Ian’s hand was a massive lump of iron that no one would dare to lift!\nGetting a direct hit in the head, the bartender passed out. It was fortunate that his head did not crack.\nKaran cheered with relief at the sight.\nThe woman, stunned at the scene, approached Ian right away.\nIan invoked <Faith> to activate the physical invigoration function.\nBut right at that moment.\nAs soon as the woman approached, Ian felt strange.\nHe was feeling the energy similar to what he felt from the Third Prince.\nAnd the closer the woman got, the more certain he was.\nIt was because <Faith> was beating hot and talked to him.\n[The Seven Virtues. It’s one of those fragments.]\nIan was inwardly surprised.\nIan’s <Faith> was one of the Seven Virtues’ powers.\nAnd the Seven Virtues were the seven legendary vassals who followed the first king of Kaisten.\nSure enough, Faith continued.\n[The power of the Seven Virtues was originally subordinate to the Great King, Royal Roader. The same goes for that woman.]\nIn other words, that woman also had a part of the Seven Virtues’ power like <Faith>.\nAnd the power of the Seven Virtues was the power that Ian was interested in as he could use it in the battle for the throne.\nIan raised his sword while being wary of how she got it, yet the woman’s reaction was strange.\nShe stopped just as she was about to pounce on Ian.\nHer eyes searched Ian in confusion.\n“No, damn it! Why can’t I attack?”\nShe clenched her teeth.\n“What have you done to me?”\nBut Ian wasn’t an idiot to answer the woman’s question.\nIan went straight out to the sword she wielded and knocked her out.\nThe woman then coughed under the table, and Karan looked at Ian in a daze.\n“Prince? What did you do just now? What was that power?”\n“Well, you don’t have to know, Third Young Master Karan.”\n“Wow, are you really doing this to the end?”\nIan slashed the rope that tied Karan with a knife and looked at the woman underneath him.\nThe woman gritted her teeth. No matter how much she tried to attack, she would not be able to attack Ian in response to his <Faith>.\nThat was why Ian found it weird.\n‘Is the Seven Virtues unable to attack each other because they were colleagues?’\nIf that was the case, he could attack as much as he wanted.\nLooking up history books, <Faith> was naturally the leader among the scattered Seven Virtues, so it explained it.\nIn fact, <Faith> even locked the power of the Seven Virtues in her.\nWell, that wasn’t important now.\n“My power… What the hell did you do?”\n“I don’t think that’s our deal today.”\n“If you want to buy my information, let’s get the original deal done and talk.”\nThe woman pursed her lips at Ian’s gleaming eyes.\nIf she didn’t accept the deal, she had a hunch he was going to kill her men.\nIn fact, Karan was pointing a dagger at the neck of the fainted bartender.\n“All right. The goods are over there.”\nIan followed the woman’s gaze and found a small box under the table.\nThe woman looked at him as if urging him to open it right away, but Ian snorted and turned to Karan.\n“Hey! I’m not in cahoots with them!”\nKaran opened the box, his dagger kept pointing at the bartender.\nWhat was inside was almost the same thing as the Third Prince gave.\nHowever, the color of the gem in the middle was different as if signifying a difference in function.\nThe woman quickly spoke.\n“The price is 1,000 gold coins. How will you pay for it?”\nOne gold coin was enough to buy a building in the city. One thousand gold coins was a huge sum of money, enough to buy a small castle on the outskirts.\nIan had no such amount yet, but he laughed shamelessly.\n“Okay, I will buy it. How do you use the necklace?”\nThe woman gave Ian a variety of information.\n“It is said that once you have a talent, you can see the talent by touching the gem of this necklace.”\nIan grabbed the necklace in his pocket.\n“What about scented candles?”\n“There’s no such thing. It’s harder to get the candle than the necklace. It’s a secret drug in the Kingdom of Magician, too. We barely get our hands on it.”\nHearing those words, Ian smirked as if he had finally caught on.\n“As expected, as Third Young Master Karan said.”\nIn the first place, Ian had a separate reason to come here while taking into account the risks.\nSure enough, Ian threatened the woman with the sword.\n“I’m going to change the terms and conditions of the deal. Forget the necklace. I want to know where the scented candles are airlifted from. Spit it out.”\nAs the transaction changed suddenly, the woman stared at Ian and Karan in bewilderment.\nHowever, Karan aimed at her subordinate’s neck as if there was no room for sympathy.\nEven the merchants in the back alleys could not disclose the source of the goods they sold.\n“Fine. I’ll tell you other than that.”\nThen Ian smiled as if he knew it.\nHe even grinned from ear to ear as if he had created this situation on purpose.\n“Okay, now tell me about the person who bought the scented candles so far. Especially the most recent buyers.”\nThis time, Karan was also surprised.\nEven so, Ian’s eyes were gleaming menacingly.\nBecause he was looking for the culprit.\n‘Those who stole my swordsmanship skills in the past.’\nAnd the person who even prevented him from enjoying his rightful rights of the Kaisten royal family.\nMoreover, following his past life, he had to find out who was trying to threaten him in the future.\n“I’m sorry, but there are no further conditions. Either die or speak, one of the two.”\nWhen the blade of the sword reached her chin, the woman panicked, but Karan also seemed very surprised.\nHe never thought Ian could make that face.\nNo, it was unthinkable as a child.\n“What’s your answer?”\n“Yes, I’ll answer you.”\nThe woman continued, holding her breath, “If you’re alive before that.”\n“Do you think I would meet Garcia and Kaistein I loathe without any preparation? Poisonous gas has already flowed into this place.”\nAt that moment, Karan groaned and stumbled. He seemed to struggle a little hard to breathe.\nThe woman, who had already drunk the antidote, was triumphant at the sight.\n“Shall we close the deal? All right. It’s 1,000 gold coins, but with a special discount, I’ll get the payment for this item with your life and his life. Now, the suffocating poison is made from snake venom. If you don’t hurry…”\n“What if I don’t hurry?”\nSoon the woman’s expression was distorted.\nIt was inevitable.\nUnlike Karan, who began to suffer, Ian was fine.\nAnd instead of talking, Ian fished out the necklace he received from the Third Prince before the woman’s eyes.\nThe woman was surprised at the familiar necklace.\n“That…! What, you already have it!”\nIan tied the woman and smiled.\n“Oh no. This poison doesn’t seem to work for me.”\nIan had already absorbed one of her talents with this necklace.\nAnd that was the “talent of detoxification.”\nIt was a talent he confirmed by touching the necklace as the woman said.\n‘Well, I didn’t expect to test it this way.’\nRight then, the woman gritted her teeth and made a strange noise.\nIt was obvious to call the minions outside.\nAt the same time, when the men’s footsteps were heard from above, the woman laughed.\n“All right, let’s get those two locked up… Ugh!”\nThe basement door was smashed, and men were thrown out like piles of trash toward the woman.\nThey are all the woman’s subordinates covered in blood.\n“Is this what you’re looking for?”\nThe woman’s face turned pale.\nIt was none other than Galon who turned her subordinates into half corpses.\n“A knight…?! How can you be here?”\nIan smiled instead of answering.\n“There is no way a royal family can walk around alone without an escort.”\nGalon had come with the half-cut letter paper from Karan.\nIn the first place, Ian lied in front of the Third Prince and beckoned to Galon for this reason.\nIt was a sign to follow him quickly.\nThere was also the purpose of seeing what the Third Prince was thinking. Of course, it took some time because the hole opened so far away. Despite that, Galon fulfilled his duties faithfully.\nSoon Ian ordered Galon to arrest her and told her the purpose of the day.\n“You don’t want your henchmen to die, do you? Tell me who bought the scented candle.”\n“Looking at your behavior, it seems to have something to do with aristocrats. If I put my mind to it, I can dig out all of your affiliations, so you’d better not deceive me.”\nThe woman shuddered.\nEventually, the woman, tightly bound by Galon, whispered in Ian’s ear as she approached him.\n“The customer who bought the goods imported from the Kingdom of Magicians through his agent is the Second Prince. And…”\nWhen Ian heard the following name, he laughed with satisfaction. It was because more interesting names poured out than he thought.\nWell, even if it wasn’t the correct answer, it was enough just to have a lead.\n“Galon, find out all the roots and get the evidence.”\nIf he could catch them, he would be able to deal with the entangled nobles or use them.\n“And I will take this necklace in exchange for threatening us. The antidote.”\nNo, come to think of it, it didn’t pay off.\nNot only did they take away his talent, but Ian also couldn’t forgive those who made him lose his pride as a royal family.\n“Did you say you come from the Kingdom of Magicians? I think you can get something more powerful than this candle. So? Is there such a thing?”\nThe woman kept her mouth shut, but to save her subordinates, she soon showed signs of surrender and held out an antidote.\n“Alright, I’ll give you that, too.”\n“Don’t worry, as a royal, I’ll pay a fair price.”\nKaran, having swallowed the antidote, looked surprised.\n“You’re not going to borrow money from my father, are you? Regardless of how much you spend…”\n“No, why would you pay? I have a brother who will pay for me.”\nGrinning, Ian pointed to the antidote bottle instead of answering.\n“By the way, Third Young Master Karan owes me the price of his life today.”\n“Also, I will charge you for introducing such a dangerous person.”\nLeaving behind Karan with a tearful expression, Ian turned to go outside.\nThe woman, tightly held by Galon, kept staring at Ian, still frustrated about why she couldn’t use her power.\nReading her gaze, Ian looked at his hand curiously.\n‘Could it possibly be absorbed by me?’\nWell, it didn’t matter.\nAs he wondered where she had obtained the power of the Seven Virtues, Ian approached the woman and whispered a lie.\n“If you want to know about that power, come to me. You know where I would be, don’t you?”\nIan’s eyes flashed and he turned around.\nIt was time to go back to the palace.\n“How long are you going to keep me waiting?”\nThe Second Prince was sitting in the drawing room of the First Knight Order headquarters, his eyes glaring.\nIt wasn’t for any other reason.\n‘How dare you not come to my call?’\nIn fact, the Second Prince called for Duke Lavaltor because he was a patient who was now unable to move.\nIn the first place, he didn’t want to go out of the palace and stand out without one arm.\nAnd Lavaltor would normally have sent a knight from the First Order.\nTherefore, the Second Prince came to see the duke himself.\nBut upon arriving, the Second Prince had to wait for a long time in the drawing room.\nFurthermore, he was furious at the various gazes headed toward his cut arm.\n‘Even though Lavaltor’s power is so great, he dares keep the royal family waiting.’\nEventually, the angry Second Prince stood to leave the drawing room and directly enter the First Knight Order.\nThe soldiers guarding the entrance of the First Knight Order stopped him.\nThe Second Prince glared at them as if it were ridiculous.\n“Do you even know whose path you’re blocking?”\n“I’m sorry, Your Highness, but we were ordered not to let outsiders in.”\n“Who are you calling an outsider? I’m here to see the duke.”\n“The duke asked you to wait.”\n“So, how much longer does he intend to keep me waiting!”\nBut the knights kept silent.\nThe Second Prince was so dumbfounded that he couldn’t even laugh.\n“All right, then bring the deputy commander. Sir Fiosen, maybe?”\n“Sir Fiosen is currently leading the training on behalf of the commander.”\nThe Second Prince’s eyes sank in impatience.\nNo matter how much he thought about it, he felt like they were trying to avoid him.\n‘That’s strange. I heard that the nobles are united under my work. There’s no way Lavaltor is falling out.’\nOf course, inside the First Knight Order headquarters, he could see the knights moving around hectically.\nIt was as if they were doing a secret operation.\nPerhaps Lavaltor was preparing to face Duke Garcia.\nThus, the Second Prince scoffed at it.\n“Very well, I will not forget this humiliation. I will remember your faces clearly.”\nFinally, the Second Prince returned to the drawing room in a rage and picked up the sword he had been carrying.\nAnd it was none other than the Sword of Domination, the symbol of the Second Prince.\n‘I tried to save it because there were conditions and limits to the number of uses, but they forced me to use this sword.’\nHe was angry that he had lost contact with the assassin he had attached to the youngest.\nAnd now that this happened, he was going to come forward himself.\n‘I let my guard down then, but this time I’ll kill you with the power of Lavaltor.’\nLavaltor, one of the two suns, was his father-in-law anyway. His personality didn’t click well with him, but he was not a man who would break the marriage law that had been decided since his predecessor’s era.\nBut right then.\n“Yo, Your Highness…!”\nThe door of the drawing room opened and a familiar face entered.\nHe was not Duke Lavaltor but instead the king’s direct chamberlain. He was relatively close to him.\nBut his expression was a little strange.\nSensing something ominous, the surprised Second Prince was about to ask, yet before he could do that.\nThe chamberlain relayed the king’s message with a stiff face.\n“Duke Lavaltor is in private conversation with His Majesty, and he has summoned the nobles. And the king ordered you to come to the palace with the Seventh Prince right now.”\nThe Second Prince flinched.\nWhy all of a sudden?\nHello everyone.

{"id": "5070", "text": "- Run Time\n- 1 hour and 32 minutes\nVP Content Ratings\n- Sex & Nudity\nA new heart I will give you, and a new spirit I will\nput within you; and I will remove from your body t\nhe heart of stone and give you a heart of flesh.\nDustin Hoffman (Harvey Shine) and Emma Thompson (Kate Walker) mesh well together in this warm Au tumn romance. Harvey has three “last” chances—for reconciling with his daughter who is about to get married; for finding true love; and for following his own dream. It also may very well be Kate’s last chance at love. Although she is younger than Harvey, she is well into what an earlier age would have called spinsterhood.\nHarvey is a failed jazz pianist reduced to writing tunes for advertising jingles in New York City. He is reluctant to attend his daughter’s wedding in London because he is in the midst of a project, one in which his boss (Richard Schiff) seems not to want his further participation. Arriving at Heathrow, Harvey rudely brushes off Kate Walker, who wants “a few minutes of your time” for him to fill out a questionnaire. He is a bit perplexed at the hotel to discover that he is the only wedding guest booked there. When he arrives at the reception (trying to hide the plastic anti-theft device still affixed to the sleeve of his new white jacket—he is the only man there dressed in white), he is taken aback to learn that his ex-wife has provided a large house for the other guests, and even more so, when his daughter Susan (Liane Balaban) apologetically informs him that she has asked her stepfather Brian (Josh Brolin) to give her away.\nFeeling totally out of place, and irritating other guests by his taking his business calls on his cell phone, Harvey retires to the bar. Because of a crisis back in New York, Harvey tells his daughter that he will not be staying for her reception on the morrow. Meanwhile Kate is having an equally hellish time on a blind date set up by her friends, who conveniently leave the two alone. But then several of her date’s friends drop by, and Kate is ignored for the rest of the evening—except for the phone calls which she receives at all times of the day from her mother, who suspects the Polish neighbor next door of disposing of a dead body.\nThe next day, following the wedding, Harvey’s taxi is caught in the rush of traffic, causing him to miss his plane. Frantically calling New York, he finally learns why his boss did not want him back at the studio—he need not rush back because the client prefers to have a younger composer work on their jingle. He no longer has a job. Drowning his sorrows at the airport bar, Harvey spies and recognizes Kate sitting alone with a glass of wine and a novel. She at first rebuffs his attempt at conversing, but his charm melts her reserve, and he accompanies her into London, sitting outside while she attends a literature class. Each time they come to a parting, he comes up with a reason to continue their relationship.\nBoth share their past, he telling her what a s—ty day he has had, and she revealing her loneliness and her long ago abortion. She insists that he must attend his daughter’s reception. He refuses, then gives in, but only if she will accompany him. She resists, but when she uses her lack of proper attire as an excuse, he tells her that he will buy the dress—but not more than a $200 one. He jokingly accuses her of agreeing in order to get a new outfit. (There follows a silly montage of her trying on various preposterous dresses that is not in keeping with the rest of the film’s restrained humor.) They show up at the reception to the surprise of all, and consternation of his ex-wife, and find themselves seated at the only table with spare seats, the children’s table. At toast time Harvey faces a moment which could ruin or change his relationship to the daughter which he has so obviously neglected through the years.\nThis is a warm film, especially for Christian viewers tired of romances in which the characters become so impassioned that they rip their clothes off five minutes after meeting. This is truly an adult romantic comedy, adult in the real sense. Kate turns out to be an appealing bearer of grace, one who changes Harvey and enhances his strained relationship not only with his daughter, but even with his ex-wife and her husband. And, as we see when he receives another phone call from his boss, telling him that the client wants to use Harvey’s music after all, he is faced with still another major decision, one which might bring grace full circle back to Kate herself.\n1. From what you are told why is Harvey estranged from his daughter? What has his career apparently meant for him? How has he had to compromise his earlier goals? How is he a bound or trapped man?\n2. His treatment at the airport of what for him was a nuisance is typical: how can we deal with such requests in a more humane way?\n3. How are he and Kate each depicted as an outsider? How do we see this in the film—his placement in the hotel; the sequence in which he tries to hide the theft-prevention device; his daughter’s wedding plans.\n4.

However, even the highest quality timber can be susceptible to wearing’s and scratches if not cared for properly.\nMaking sure to put effort into taking proper care of your wood furniture/floorboards will reward you in the long run by adding beauty into your property. To ensure your wood floor lasts as long as possible looking its best, here are some tips on how you can look after it…\nCare Tips For Reclaimed Floorboards\n- As the majority of our products are used for flooring it is vital to remember to be careful and considerate when moving and rearranging furniture. We advise never to drag large and heavy objects across your wooden floor to prevent dents or scratches.\n- Make sure to be careful about exposing your floorboards to sunlight for a long period of time. It could result in ‘spotting’ where light and dark spots appear across your timber. To prevent this you could use rugs or carpet runners on the areas where the sunlight directly hits. You could also place these in high footfall areas such as halls, doorways and stairs, preventing any wear or tear from heavy shoes, work boots, high heels etc.\n- Despite your best efforts sometimes your wood will get stained due to leaks or spillages. Be sure to clean up any kind of stain as quickly as possible to prevent the stain being harder to remove.\n- When using reclaimed floorboards within homes with pets making sure that long and sharp claws are trimmed is important. This can prevent scratches that will potentially ruin your flooring.\n- To keep your floor looking pristine make sure to regularly sweep, dust or vacuum your timber. This will help to keep your flooring looking as fresh and clean as possible continuing to add charm and aesthetic to your homes.", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

However, academic radiology in Australia and New Zealand (ANZ) has not traditionally been a strength of the specialty which has a focus on clinical medicine and has been influenced by corporatisation of the specialty. The aim of this study was to review the source(s) of radiologist-led research in Australia and New Zealand, to identify areas of relative deficiency and propose plans to improve research output. Methods: A manual search was performed of all manuscripts in seven popular ANZ journals, where the corresponding or senior author was a radiologist. Publications between January 2017 and April 2022 were included. Results: There were 285 manuscripts from ANZ radiologists during the study period. This equates to 10.7 manuscripts per 100 radiologists based on RANZCR census data. Radiologists in Northern Territory, Victoria, Western Australia, South Australia and the Australian Capital Territory all produced manuscripts above the corrected mean incidence rate of 10.7 manuscripts per 100 radiologists. However, locations including Tasmania, New South Wales, New Zealand and Queensland were below the mean. The majority of manuscripts arose from public teaching hospitals with accredited trainees (86%), and there were a higher proportion of manuscripts published by female radiologists (11.5 compared to 10.4 per 100 radiologists). Conclusion: Radiologists in ANZ are academically active; however, interventions aimed at increasing output could be targeted at certain locations and/or areas within a busy private sector. Time, culture, infrastructure and research support are vital, but personal motivation is also extremely important.", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}

It involves the use of radio frequency signals to increase the power or amplitude of a signal, allowing it to be transmitted over longer distances or received with greater clarity. Understanding the basics of RF circuits amplification is crucial for engineers and technicians working in fields such as telecommunications, broadcasting, and wireless communication.\nAt its core, RF circuits amplification relies on the use of active components such as transistors or vacuum tubes. These components are designed to amplify the electrical signals they receive, boosting their power level without significantly altering their frequency or waveform. By carefully designing and implementing these circuits, engineers can achieve the desired amplification while minimizing distortion and noise. This allows for the efficient transmission and reception of RF signals, ensuring reliable communication in various applications.\nClick here for additional info.\nThe Role of Power Amplifiers in RF Circuit Design\nThe power amplifier plays a crucial role in RF circuit design. As the name suggests, it is responsible for amplifying the power of the electrical signals that are transmitted or received in a radio frequency (RF) circuit. To see also : Wave Propagation in Transmission Lines. This amplification is necessary because RF signals are often weak and need to be boosted in order to be effectively transmitted over long distances or received with enough strength to be processed by other components in the circuit.\nIn RF circuit design, the choice of power amplifier is dependent on various factors such as the frequency range of operation, the power requirements of the circuit, and the linearity and efficiency desired. Different types of power amplifiers, such as Class A, Class B, Class AB, and Class C amplifiers, offer different trade-offs in terms of power efficiency, linearity, and complexity of circuit design. Thus, it is important for RF circuit designers to carefully evaluate these trade-offs to select the appropriate power amplifier that best suits the specific requirements of their circuit design.\nKey Components of Power Amplifiers in RF Circuits\nPower amplifiers are a critical element in RF circuits, boosting the signal strength to achieve the desired transmission range. These amplifiers consist of several key components that work in tandem to optimize performance. One such component is the power transistor, which is responsible for amplifying the input signal. With its capability to handle high power levels and operate efficiently at high frequencies, the power transistor plays a crucial role in ensuring signal fidelity and minimizing distortion.\nAnother vital component in power amplifiers is the matching network, which facilitates impedance matching between the power amplifier and the load. This network ensures maximum power transfer, minimizing signal reflections and enhancing overall efficiency. By adjusting the impedance levels, the matching network ensures that the power amplifier is properly tuned to operate within its optimal range. This not only maximizes power transfer but also ensures the longevity of the amplifier by preventing any damage due to impedance mismatches.\nDifferent Classes of Power Amplifiers and their Advantages\nClass A power amplifiers are known for their high fidelity and low distortion. They operate by using a single transistor that is in a constant state of conduction, allowing a smooth and continuous waveform to be reproduced. This results in an accurate representation of the audio signal without any harsh or clipped tones. Read also : Introduction to Transmission Line Theory. Class A amplifiers also have excellent linearity, meaning that they can faithfully amplify both low-level and high-level signals with minimal distortion. On the downside, they are highly inefficient and generate a significant amount of heat. As a result, they are typically larger, bulkier, and require more power to operate compared to other classes of power amplifiers.\nClass D power amplifiers, on the other hand, are known for their high efficiency and compact size. Unlike Class A amplifiers, Class D amplifiers use a switching technique to rapidly turn the output transistors on and off. This allows them to achieve high power efficiency, as they spend most of their operating time either fully on or fully off. Due to this switching nature, Class D amplifiers produce less heat and can be built in smaller sizes, making them ideal for portable audio devices and space-constrained installations. However, their inherent switching distortion can limit their use in high-fidelity applications, and they may require additional filtering and damping to minimize any potential audio artifacts.\nUnderstanding the different classes of power amplifiers and their advantages is crucial when selecting the right amplifier for your specific audio requirements. While Class A amplifiers offer exceptional fidelity, they consume more power and generate more heat. Class D amplifiers, on the other hand, prioritize efficiency and compactness, making them a suitable choice for portable and space-limited applications. By considering your needs and carefully evaluating the pros and cons of each amplifier class, you can make an informed decision that best suits your audio setup.\nDesign Considerations for Power Amplifiers in RF Circuits\nWhen designing power amplifiers for RF circuits, there are several important considerations to keep in mind. Firstly, the operating frequency range of the amplifier must be carefully selected. This may interest you : Smith Chart and its Applications in Transmission Line Theory. This will depend on the specific application and the frequency range of the RF circuit. Choosing a suitable operating frequency range is crucial to ensure optimal performance and efficiency of the power amplifier.\nAnother key design consideration is the output power requirements. It is essential to determine the desired output power level of the amplifier based on the RF circuit’s specifications and the intended application. This will dictate the power handling capability and the overall design of the amplifier circuit. Factors like linearity, efficiency, and distortion also need to be taken into account when designing power amplifiers for RF circuits, as they can significantly impact the overall performance and signal quality.\nImpedance Matching in Power Amplification for Maximum Efficiency\nImpedance matching plays a crucial role in power amplification for achieving maximum efficiency. When the source impedance and load impedance are properly matched, it ensures that power is transferred between the amplifier and the load without any reflections or loss. By minimizing the reflection of power, impedance matching enhances the overall system performance, reducing power wastage and improving signal quality.\nOne of the key benefits of impedance matching is the increased power transfer. When the source impedance is matched with the load impedance, the power flow is optimized, allowing the maximum power to be delivered to the load. This not only improves the overall efficiency of the amplifier but also prevents the occurrence of standing waves or interference, which could degrade the signal integrity. Furthermore, impedance matching helps to reduce the strain on the amplifier by minimizing any power loss that may generate excess heat. As a result, the amplifier operates more efficiently and reliably, contributing to the longevity of the equipment and the consistent delivery of a high-quality signal.", "scores": {"score": 4, "score_transform_1": 5, "score_transform_2": 5, "score_transform_3": 0}}

Every Wednesday night they are present in the city-centre handing out sleeping-bags and clothing to those most in need. Trainers are usually the item they hand out most and every year.\nAt the Celtic supporter group Green Brigade’s anti-discrimination tournament they run a stall and ask people to donate their second-hand trainers.\nThe founder of The Invisibles, Dermot Hill, said the event was a great success.\nHill told CommonSpace: “As ever it was a cracking day at James McGrory Park and always a great thing to be a part of. The Invisibles have been attending this tournament for four years now collecting clothes and trainers and the response is very humbling and the generosity of Glaswegians always impresses. We got loads of clothes too and were even getting trainers in their boxes brand new.\n“I would like to relay a massive thank you to all involved. The Green Brigade for allowing us to set up our collection point and the staff and players at St Rochs always make us feel so welcome. Obviously a huge thanks to all the donors, their donations will be helping make our homeless folk that bit more comfortable in the months ahead. And I almost forgot our own volunteers – they were superb as always.”\nThe tournament is held at the home of St Roch’s Juniors on Royston Road, Glasgow, and activists and charities from all over Glasgow come together to play football and connect with new ideas and people. Groups like the Red Front Republic and Glasgow Afghan United were among those invited to enter the tournament this year.\nThe Invisibles were joined by other groups running stalls and raising awareness such as Living Rent and Royston Youth Action. Period Poverty campaigners Erin Slaven, Orlaith Duffy & Mikaela McKinley were also in attendance and were happy to announce afterward that St Roch’s will now be offering free sanitary products from next season onwards.\nThe Invisibles are one of around fifty street-groups helping the homeless and operating on a voluntary basis in and around Glasgow city centre. Most of these groups offer food and drinks but The Invisibles noticed a need for clothing and sleeping bags and decided this is the area they would look to help.\nMany of the soup kitchen’s in Glasgow occur in Cadogan Street next to Glasgow City Mission’s premises. This is where The Invisibles base themselves too on a Tuesday night. Their team of volunteers arrive and set up their stall with some clothes that people can help themselves too. Whilst this is going on another few of their volunteers will mingle among the crowds and select anyone they think is particuarly vulnerable and equp them with anything they think is essential, such as a sleeping bag.\nPicture courtesy of the Invisibles", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}

As we stated at that time, believe Phelps Dodge has the most attractive technical pattern of the major copper companies. This has been born out by recent market action when Phelps Dodge made a new high at 44 1/8, while both Anaconda nd Kennecott failed to reach their former 1947 highs by several points. The technical Pattern on Phelps Dodge indicates much higher levels. Some minor resistance may be encountered at 47, the 1946 high, but the next objective is around 55-60. Eventual price level for the longer term is the 85-90 level. Pure Oil was recommended for purchase at 23 7/8 in our letter of April 24th. Thursdays close was 267;8. At its recent high of 28 3/4, Pure Oil had not only definitely penetrated the February high of 25 3/4 but had nearly equaled the 1946 high of 28 7/8. The stock, from a technical approach, appears headed higher for both the near term and the longer term. First price objective is 32 and the longer term level is indicated as 42. Rayonier was first recommended for purchase at 19 5/8 in our letter of November 1st. It was again recommended at 21 in our letter of May 8th. Rayonier made a new high for the year on Thursday at 26 1/2. The close was 26 3/8. Earnings for the first six months of 1947 were released earlier in the week and totalled 3.24 a common share. Rayonier has been in a trading range between roughly 26 and 18 for approximately ten months. Ability to reach 27 would indicate a priee objective in the 1iJ-45 range. Revere Copper &Brass was originally recommended for purchase in the 21-19 buying range in our letter of September 11th. Thursdays close was 19 7/8. Market action in this issue has been below average but it appears to be building up a rather favorable pattern that may take a little more time to complete. Earnings for the first six months of 1947 were 3.51 a share. he market has, so far, been unable to penetrate last Fridays intraday highs of 184.38 and 50.03. However, action of individual issues has been good wih a number reaching new highs for the year. It is possible that the industrials may further test the July 30th low of 179.77 or even dip a little deeper into our 181-177 buying range before resuming the uptrend.

The 28 year-old Costco worker and self-described “Bite-Size Beethoven” has served numerous fan favorites including pigs in a prayer quilt, fourth-dimensional cheese cubes, and the MacBook and cheese bites.\nThese dishes have not gone unnoticed, as patrons are lining up daily at McKindle’s station located between the cold cuts and the eight-foot inflatable pool alligator. “I love Hank!” remarked Tim Snozzlebeard, a regular at Costco Wholesale. “That fancy man gives my tummy a real tantalizing culinary experience! I mean who else would dare to put not one, but two types of ranch on a carrot?”\nAlthough Costco members remain impressed, McKindle insists that he did not become a sample specialist overnight. “He spent the last five years perfecting his craft,” remarked Linda Adnil, the store manager who also happens to be McKindle’s aunt. “I gave him the job after my sister told me he failed out of air-traffic control school — at first I thought he was just avoiding work since he would spend hours in the walk-in produce fridge. Turns out it was just part of his training!” McKindle reportedly has no formal culinary schooling, saying “If you want to prepare food you have to first understand what it’s like to be food. So yeah, I spent my first couple years here just hanging out with the food, climbing up the shelves, and covering myself in raw pieces of chicken breast.”\nDespite McKindle’s unorthodox methods, he has continuously received praise, both commercially and critically. McKindle and his samples will soon be reviewed by the Michelin Guide which may earn him a Michelin Star, one of the highest honors in the world of culinary arts. McKindle mentioned his plan “to do something totally unheard of in the world of sampling” when asked about potentially receiving this distinction. “I want to do something the Michelin guide has never seen: samples, but instead of a small measly portion, I give them food on a circular 10-inch dish.”\nEven if McKindle fails to earn the Michelin Star, Adnil affirms that he will keep his position, as she reports “a 57% increase in patrons doing that thing where they go around a second time for a sample, but pretend it’s their first time and say something like ‘oh this looks good,’ or ‘hey, I’ll try that.’” Results on whether McKindle earned an imaginary star from the tire company remain inconclusive at the time of reporting.\nFlattened in a distro cart accident, the MQ replaced his bones with leftover printer ink.

{"id": "5322", "text": "While Toronto may not be the first place you think of when it comes to the technology industry, Canada’s largest city has quietly become one of the fastest-growing hubs in the industry. Thanks to an ideal combination of top-tier education, liberal immigration policies, and a growing business environment, Toronto has become the third-largest technology economy in North America, behind only Silicon Valley and New York City.\nWhy Is Toronto Tech Growing So Fast?\nThe secret to Toronto’s success as a growing tech hub is a combination of education and “anchor corporations.” Between both the University of Toronto and the nearby University of Waterloo, the metropolitan area has a deep talent pool of recent graduates.\nIn addition to these two tech-forward universities, the city has also attracted several tech giants, including both homegrown corporations and Canadian headquarters of major tech companies like Google and Apple. These anchor corporations bring a capable workforce of tech talent who eventually seek to strike out on their own, generating new start-ups and more business.\nToronto Start-ups Beginning to Scale\nThe mark of a successful tech sector is when a city’s best start-ups begin to scale, rapidly becoming national and global players as they disrupt entrenched industries along the way. These are just some of Toronto’s recent success stories when it comes to start-ups that have begun to scale in a major way.\nBuying a home has become more challenging everywhere in North America, especially in major cities like Toronto. With all the added stress from high prices and a frustrating process, consumers were ready for a new way of doing things.\nNobul is a Toronto-based digital marketplace where consumers can find real estate agents who compete with each other for their business. It’s created a third-party platform that attracts agents from all of the major brokerages, puts downward pressure on fees as those agents compete more transparently, and gives consumers more information and accountability about who they’re working with.\nThe company recently completed $5 billion in sales, and as the company expands into major American markets, it looks positioned to scale rapidly in the near future. In the words of Founder and CEO Regan McGee, “As we continue to aggressively invest in our real estate marketplace, platform, people, and product offerings, Nobul is poised to expand its business even more in 2022 and beyond.”\nWattpad began as an online social reading platform combining social media with fanfiction, which has now transformed into a publisher and multimedia partner that transforms the platform’s most successful stories into books, TV shows and movies. The platform currently has nearly 100 film and TV projects on the go, having turned itself into one of the most unique media content generators around.\nShopify has become a world leader in e-commerce, providing a third-party platform that retailers of all sizes can use to sell their products online.\nThe company actually started as a snowboard shop back in 2004, long. Frustrated by cumbersome platforms available at the time, they built their own. They quickly pivoted into a company that provided the platform itself, transforming into a multi-billion-dollar company as they helped their customers grow into successful online merchants.", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}
{"id": "5327", "text": "There is not long to go in the NBA regular season and the race for the playoff places is really heating up. With only a few teams actually completely out of the running, there is a clamor by the top teams to avoid the play-in tournament. Although there are some others that would do everything they could just to finish seventh to tenth in their conference.\nObviously there is still a lot of basketball still to be played in the next few weeks. But whether you know how to bet on NBA online or not, there are some players that should definitely be part of your postseason plans. How the playoffs go could be down to some, or all, of the following five.\nDonovan Mitchell, Cleveland Cavaliers\nWhen Mitchell turned down his home state New York Knicks to play in Cleveland, it immediately made the Cavs a playoff team. He had done a lot of good work in Utah – and he has shown Cleveland fans why he was so urgently sought after. His record this season has been nothing short of incredible.\nThe highlight has to be that 71-point haul against the Chicago Bulls in January. It was a Cavaliers record and the highest scoring game for anyone since Kobe posted 81 in 2006. Mitchell’s form is important – if not integral – to this Cavs team and he could even get to show his talent against the Knicks in a potential first round series.\nNikola Jokic, Denver Nuggets\nIf you doubt Nikola Jokic’s importance to the Denver Nuggets, you should realize that his MVP award last season was only the third time that a player had received the prize with a team that had posted fewer than 50 regular season games. He is also now on course to win the award for the third straight year.\nThe Nuggets have hit a sticky patch at probably the wrong moment, but it should not derail the team’s chances of taking the number one spot – and home advantage – in the Western Conference. Now Jokic has the chance to add a championship ring to his ever-growing collection of MVPs. Also Read – The History And Cultural Significance Of Sports Trophies And Awards\nJalen Brunson, New York Knicks\nThe failure of the New York Knicks to do just about anything of note has been a long-running joke for decades now. There has been just one playoff series in the last ten years – with just one game won against the Hawks two seasons ago. But there is an air of confidence around the Garden this year.\nThe entire Knicks roster is playing much better and the coach has brought through some very exciting youngsters. But it was the addition of Jalen Brunson that sparked real hope. If the point guard can stay fit, the Knicks could even pull off a few surprises in the playoffs. No pressure there then!\nGiannis Antetokounmpo, Milwaukee Bucks\nThe current Knicks roster may not have too much experience of the postseason but Milwaukee’s main man has gotten used to playing deep into April. He is the last player not called Luka Jokic to win the NBA MVP award – and he won it back-to-back as well as a Finals MVP when the Bucks won in 2021.\nMilwaukee is now leading the way in a very congested Eastern Conference and Giannis is, once again, leading the charge. The Bucks should go deep into the playoffs this year too, and it will need a team effort for them to pick up a second championship in three years. But one player is definitely more important than the rest.\nJa Morant, Memphis Grizzlies\nOur final player to keep an eye on in the NBA playoffs was one of the standout stars of last season and looked like he was going to repeat that performance this year. But recent events off the court have put Ja Morant’s ability to help the Memphis Grizzlies win the championship in real doubt.\nWe won’t go into the incidents here, but Memphis fans must be worried about their star player. He has the ability – and showed it last year – to turn this small-market team into a major player in the NBA. Hopefully he will have the chance to do just that and allow us to watch his talent on the court in the playoffs.", "scores": {"score": 0, "score_transform_1": 0, "score_transform_2": 0, "score_transform_3": 1}}

{"id": "5396", "text": "Note: WarChronicle is sad to report the death of Vincent DiGaetano on October 30, 2006. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family. He will be forever in our hearts. Rest in peace, Vinny.\nThe narrative below was edited from conversations in spring and summer of 2000.\nVinny DiGaetano joined the 1st Division in England before D-Day. He was wounded four times until the war, but never badly enough to get sent home.\nWhen I first spoke with DiGaetano he corroborated many of the general points in the Lt. Spalding narrative of 1945 (see Spalding D-Day narrative). But Vinny’s story, as he told it, also had many interesting divergences in detail.\nMany popular historians have written about D-Day. Nearly all of them have used the Pogue/Spalding narrative as their sole source for that piece of the action. This has meant, in many a book, Vinny DiGaetano has yelled on D-Day morning, “I’m drowning! What do you want me to do with this flamethrower?” And, in many a book, later on the D-Day, DiGaetano was hit in the butt by shrapnel. If these authors had contacted Vinny they would have gotten a much better story.\nI came from Bensonhurst: 39th Street and Fifth Avenue in Brooklyn. I was born December 7, 1923. So I was 18 the day the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor.\nI got drafted in 43. Until I got drafted I worked for Sperry Gyroscope making gyroscopes for bombers.\nWhen I first went through basic training [in Texas], all those Rebels down there knew everything about snakes. I didn’t know nothing. What the hell’s a snake? I used to be walking through a field and see a copperhead. They’d take their bayonets and cut its head off. Holy s—-. I’d be running the other way. I ain’t fooling you with, man. [Laughs] The things you remember. In basic training, I’m on the flank and I trip over this barbed wire and I go sailing and rolling down the hill. I end up with a frigging coral snake. I never saw a coral snake in my life. He’s all different colors, beautiful looking snake. And they say that’s the most dangerous snake down there: Watch out. And I start running. I just happened to be the last guy in the flank. We were spreading out. And for some reason or other there was a barbed wire over there and I tripped over it and went flying down the hill. Hello, snake.\nMost of my time in the army was spent overseas. I only spent eight or nine months in the States and the rest of the time I spent overseas. I left the States on November 15 1943. It was almost two years from the time I left the States till the time I came back.\nThe guys were in England training before I came into the company. The first sergeant was from New York. Fitzsimmons. Captain Wozenski was from Connecticut. I got along with Fitzsimmons good because I was from New York also. There wasn’t too many New Yorkers in there. When he found out I was from New York we got along pretty good. He used to search me out all the time.\nWhen we were fighting in the Falaise gap, I found seven hundred dollars in German money on an empty bus. Then, when I got wounded in the Hürtgen, I gave it to Fitzsimmons to hold for me. But when I got back, he was gone.[I mentioned another E Company soldier, Richard Gallagher, who was from Grant Avenue in Brooklyn. DiGaetano didn’t remember him, and said Grant Avenue was in Bushwick, the other side of Brooklyn from his old neighborhood.]\nI remember Colwell. I remember Peterson, too. He was from Jersey. [I asked Vinny if he remembered anything about them. He said, No, just the name, that’s all.] A lot of them were together through Sicily and Africa and they used to pal around together and you never wanted to interfere or you never were invited. I stayed alone a lot. I was an introvert then. I kept to myself a lot.\nI asked Vinny if he remembers anyone telling him he did a good job or patting you on the back? Vinny laughed very hard, then said, “Probably in the beginning, maybe Streczyk. Give you a pat on the ass, something like that. Keep up the good work, or something.”\nIf I had come into the outfit from the beginning, I probably would have been more friendly. But I came in, a stranger, and just doing my own thing. Go to a movie or something. I read magazines a lot. Life, magazine, Esquire, Saturday Evening Post, whatever we could get our hands on.\nMy sister Jean was seven or eight years older than me. When I was home, she was always picking on me. Then when I went away, she wrote me everyday; what was going on here and there.\nIn the Marshalling Area, I got a V-letter from her that my father passed away. He had one of those heart attacks on his way to work and he died. He died at work, so it wasn’t like he was sick or anything. He just 1,2,3, gone. Those days, in 1944, they didn’t have the sophisticated medicine they have today. Machines, bypasses and none of that jazz. He was working like 12, 14 hour days.\nI showed the letter to somebody and they said, “Well, too late now, you’re in the marshalling area. We can’t let you go because you know about the invasion… and this, that, and the other thing. I read the letter telling me that my father was buried. I didn’t know he was dead. Now he’s buried. I tried to get home. They said, no, no way, goodbye.\nWhen DiGaetano and I first met, he told a different story than the account in the Army Historical Division’s interview with John Spalding. Vinny freely admits he’s forgotten much of what happened during the war. Still, his D-Day memories are vivid, and the basics of his story are credible.\nAt H-Hour, DiGaetano left the landing craft with his 72-pound flame thrower. As he floundered in the water, he inflated his life preserver. It was attached to his back, along with the flame thrower, and its inflation sent Vinny face down under the water. He used his knife to saw off the straps and came up for air. Then he used the floating weapon as a raft to get to shore. Leaving the flamethrower bobbing in the water, Vinny staggered to the seawall, but Streczyk sent him back to get the weapon.\nVinny remembers using the flame against a pillbox in the strongpoint above Easy Red. Later, when the section was near Colleville, DiGaetano saw enemy movement through a gap in a hedgerow. Almost instantly, his rifle was shot out of his hands by enemy automatic weapon fire. Then a German grenade sailed through the hedgerow, exploded, and a fragment ripped into DiGaetano’s thigh.\nA medic came to Vinny’s aid and suggested he go down to the beach for aid. Vinny refused. He lowered his pants and the medic cut out the fragment with a trench knife. The worst part wasn’t the pain, Vinny recalls, it was having his pants down. Vinny also remembers using a safety pin, for many weeks after the invasion, to dig out splinters of metal and wood from the rifle.\nThere is a gap in the story. Vinny didn’t bring a rifle ashore, but he had one later in the afternoon. Vinny didn’t remember where he got it, but Fred Reese remembered. Reese told me that he and DiGaetano were sharing a rifle between them.\nThe identity of the medic isn’t absolutely certain. Vinny thought it might have been a pal of his, Gerald Bianchi. Reese said, no, it was Jesse Hamilton of Oklahoma. Both men served in the Medical Detachment of the 16th Infantry.\nSome members of Spalding’s section tell a nearly identical story about a German gunner, who turned out to be Polish, on the slope above Easy Red. Vinny tells the story below.\nHe [the gunner on the slope above Easy Red] is in a one-man foxhole and he’s shooting like hell. Finally, we get around behind him. He only threw up his hands when we got behind him and put a gun to his head. [Laughs] That’s when he finally found out he was Polish, started talking Polish.\nHe says, “I got captured, I don’t want to shoot!” One-man foxhole and shooting like crazy! Streczyk talked to him in Polish and he got so crazy with him he punched him. “What the hell are you doing?” Pow!\nVinny’s wife, Chris, joined in and asked if Streczyk was the one who sent him back for the flamethrower? Vinny said yes. Chris said, “And you went back?” Vinny said, “What the hell do I know? He told me to go back, I go back.”\nWe got the flamethrower it and went to a pillbox. The Germans come out, Aaaaah! They didn’t even know we had a frigging flamethrower. They were hiding in the back or something. If you get them, they know about it. Had to be like napalm. In 30 seconds, or a minute, all gone. The tank was empty. Goodbye.\nWhat’s his name, [Fred] Reese? He has a fantastic memory, I think. He remembers me, that thing with the gun. That’s great. I guess if I gave somebody my gun and then it was shot to pieces, I’d probably remember it too.\nI mentioned that in an interview with Spalding, Vinny was said to have been “hit in the butt by shrapnel fire.” Vinny laughed. He also laughed at the idea of a yelling, “I’m drowning, what do you want me to do with this flamethrower?”\nIt was about four or five o’clock in the afternoon when I got hit. I got hit in the leg, up here [points to thigh. But that was from the grenade.\nIf it was our grenade, I would have been blown to bits. But they had these stupid mashed potatoes and they stunk. They were concussion things. Ours were fragmentation. Theirs were more or less concussion. When it blew up, pieces of metal that came from there was enough to do some damage. But it wasn’t like ours where the whole thing would blew apart. Fragmentation, you know? Ours were more deadly than theirs. They were garbage. We thought they were garbage. It was a good thing too.\nI remember the count that night at 9:00 or 10:00 o’clock. It didn’t get dark until about 1:00 o’clock in the morning. It was Double British Summertime, you know? About 10:00 or 11:00 o’clock at night they had a count and from what I remember, 90 of us were left out of 250. They weren’t all killed, probably they were wounded a lot of them. And missing too. But everything was all mixed up then. We had guys from the 29th Division with us most of the day, they had that blue and grey patch. They were with us a lot of the day. They wanted to stay with somebody they didn’t want to be deserted.\nI got a Purple Heart a little after D-Day. There was no ceremony. They gave you a Purple Heart then you had to try and take care of the damn thing. I think I mailed mine home.\nThere was nothing joyous about it [victory on D-Day] because you had the next hedgerow, the next hedgerow, the next hedgerow. And there were a whole load of hedgerows. Like we never really run out of them in Normandy. And every time you got to a hedgerow you never know if there’s going to be another battle, another fire fight. So it was just going from hedgerow to hedgerow to hedgerow.\nThey had hedges on top, they were about three or four feet high and they hedges on top of them. They were mounds of dirt.\nThe thing that saved us is that they had these tanks. The tanks would go over and flush them so we could go through. We had this bastard tank outfit with us. They weren’t assigned to our regiment, bastard tanks, they weren’t our tanks, they were just a group of tanks. So you had to try and crash through those things. Just go over the hedgerows and we’d follow them. They’d smash them down and we’d climb over them.\nOne of the first nights we were in hedgerows. All night long, I’m saying, “There’s something’s moving. Something’s moving there.” And the guy relieving me, I said, “There’s something out there.” [Laughs] It was a freaking cow. I should of shot that bastard. I’m telling you, all night long I kept seeing something, something moving out there. It turned out to be a Goddamn cow grazing all night long.\nThings are so distant, know what I mean? It’s hard to pinpoint [when specific events occurred]. I can pinpoint when [Gerald] Bianchi died and stuff like that because it was depressing.\nYou just did what you had to do and the next day came. That’s it. A lot of that stuff you just don’t remember. Especially since I never doted on it, or I never talked about it or anything. [Laughs]\nOne time we got into a house. We hadn’t been sleeping in houses for a long time after we got into Germany. It had to be the end of the Hürtgen forest because I remember we was cold that night. And we got into this town and they had these big goose-down covers on the bed. You had a blanket there and then you had this thing Holy s! It was great! We all undressed when we got to bed that night. Big goose feathered thing on top of us, farting our ass off. [Laughs]\nThings like that, crazy things, you remember.\nYou couldn’t change your socks. You couldn’t stop to take a bath. You just did what you could to try and keep clean everyday. Using latrines, all that kind of garbage.\nThe helmets were everything. You’d cook in them, eat out of them. The helmets were the greatest thing in the world. They were a little heavy until you got used to wearing them. You couldn’t really take them off because you couldn’t tell when they’d start shelling you or mortars would be coming in. And helmets saved so many lives.\nI wasn’t a religious person. Every once in awhile in a foxhole, [I’d say to God:] “How you doing? Remember me?” Every time the chaplain came around, “You want Communion?” “Yeah, can’t hurt.” My mother had to be the one who got me through the war. She wore out her knees, saying novenas to everybody, every saint you could think of. And masses.\nThe days went by so fast. Just going, and going, and going. Before you know it they had the St. Lô breakthrough, then they had the Falaise gap, the next thing you knew we were taken Aachen, the next thing you knew we were in the Hürtgen forest. From there you were doing something else. I guess it was close to 300 days I had in combat [from D-Day to the end of the war]\nOne night, they took us off the line for a five day rest. I guess it had to be before the Hürtgen forest and after the Falaise gap. They took us off the line and we watched a movie. All of a sudden, about seven, eight oclock at night, one of these planes [a German plane] come in and strafe. Strafed the area. The guy in front of me got killed, the guy in back of me got killed. It’s unbelievable. How the hell do these things happen? It’s so weird. And it was very unusual for a German plane to come over and strafe you.\nTwice I saw guys who’d been sliced by bullets. It’s a freak thing to get sliced by a bullet; it’s a weird thing that’ll happen.\nThe first guy was a German soldier with his guts hanging out. And these guys said, “Don’t give him any water, he’ll die.” And I said, “What the hell is going to happen to him now? He’s going to die anyway. Give him some water, let him die happy at least.”\nThe next guy we saw was an American guy and he was holding his guts in. I’m pretty sure Bianchi put some safety pins in there. Know that I mean? Hold this guy until the medics come. Because I remember, Bianchi was doing something there. Had to be putting safety pins. If the guy held his guts in there he could be probably be saved. They push it in and sew it up, you know? But the other guy, the German\nYou see all this kind of stuff, you got to get callous. Look down in a foxhole and a guy got no head. Holy’s Jesus Christ. I looked down one time aarrrrghhh no head. Most have been a tank or something like that. Goodbye.\nWeird things happen.\nOne day, this replacement shows up. Nineteen year-old kid from the Midwest: Ohio or one of those one, Tennessee or something like that. This kid said, “I’m going to go out and get some Germans.” We said, “What are you crazy?” He went out and that was the last we saw of him until we found his body. Unbelievable. They got him.\nOut of the clear blue sky, a sniper gets a guy. Boom. He goes down. Where the hell? Where did it come from, why did it come from? Why do these things happen?\nOnce in the Hürtgen, I just happened to move my leg before a shell fragment hit right where my leg had been. I dug it out of the ground with my knife it was about three inches around. I kept it with me for quite awhile.\nThe odds are against you as you keep going every day, every day.\nThey never even thought about taking us out. Later on, the next war, in Korea and especially in Vietnam you served a year then, boom, you’re out. [In World War II] We could be there for three or four years before they take you out.\nI asked if Vinny ever thought about deserting. He said, “Nah, we never thought of that. It never occurred to us. The only time is when I jumped off a train in Paris with two paratroopers. We had three or four days on the outskirts of Paris. At least we got something. We had to go right back into combat. But as far as deserting, nah. Not too many people talked about that. I guess that was the way we were brought up. In the era we were brought up in, that’s the way we were taught.”\nEverybody reacts different to combat. There are some people that can’t take it and some people just let it go, you know what I mean? It’s hard How somebody’s mind works really. In a million years, you’d never think that Streczyk would be one of the guys who cracked up, but there you go, you never know.\nHe didn’t crack up until the Hürtgen forest. And when you see that I think he was one of the most highly decorated soldiers in the army. He had a lot of awards. He had everything but the Congressional Medal of Honor.\nWe beat the krauts to the Siegfried Line by about eight to ten hours. We dug in on the other side of the pillbox that they had. We dug our trenches in there. Foxholes and trenches. And when they [the Germans] came they were determined. They wanted to get the Siegfried Line.\nAnd that’s when a guy from Brooklyn got captured. He came from my neighborhood. He got captured that night, and I didn’t see him until I got back to Brooklyn. Ignazio Anielo. [Chris wondered about the derivation of Ignazio. Vinny said, “Who the hell knows? He was just called Iggy in Brooklyn.”] I met him when he hit the platoon. He was a replacement and then he got captured right away. He wasn’t with the outfit two months. I don’t know if he got released right away. Maybe he escaped or something. I really don’t know.\nDuring the fight around Aachen and the Siegfried Line:] There was a time we had to have a truce because we killed so many of them. We had to have a truce right outside of Aachen. There were so many of them killed by fire and by artillery and stuff like that.\nSo they [a group of Germans] come out with a white flag. They said, is it all right if we have a truce so we can clean up and get our dead?\nAgreement was reached.] They had like a three or four hour truce so they could clean up. They had a lot of casualties there. We were digging in and they were counterattacking. And we were just standing there and firing and a bunch of our guys most have gotten killed or wounded, but they were taking the worst of it.\nIt was about November 24th when I got evacuated in the Hürtgen forest. It was the day after Thanksgiving [Thanksgiving in 1944 fell on 23 November]. The reason I know is because we hadn’t eaten for a long time. We were eating K rations, C rations, we were eating them. And they said they wanted to get us a hot meal for Thanksgiving.\nI said it must have been cold by the time it got to the front line. Vinny laughed and said, “We didn’t care. We didn’t even care if it was cooked! It was something to eat.”\nI remember getting a leg, yeah, I’m pretty sure I got a leg. I was chomping on with coffee. And I got hit in the hand the next day and I got evacuated. I said, boy, it was a Million Dollar Wound.\nWhat happened was that we’d come out of the trees and a German tank opened up with direct fire. And tanks can reload fast so it’s just ba-boom, ba-boom, ba-boom. I grabbed on to a tree and a piece of metal went right through my finger. Three other guys with me were killed.\nNearly home free\nVinny’s evacuation ended before he reached England. Vinny recalls that soldiers of the 66th Division (whose troop ship, on Christmas eve, was sunk in the English Channel by a German submarine) were given priority medical treatment. Battle was raging in the Ardennes and walking wounded were ordered to report back for duty. Vinny, still wearing a bandage, had to make his way back through Paris and got a little side tracked.\nThe 66th Division, their boat had hit a mine, and that’s when they sent all the walking patients out. So many people were exposed to the ice cold water. [The doctors said to other patients:] Goodbye, see you again. My hand was all bandaged, and they got rid of us so fast the blood was coming through. But it was dry.\nVinny ended up on a train with two paratroopers who got on idea as they rolled through Paris.\nThey just said, “Let’s go, let’s jump!” I said, “You’re crazy! The train’s going too fast.” They’re holding me on each side, and we jumped in a snow bank. Train wasn’t going fast. Jumped in a snowbank. We had three or four days on the outskirts of Paris. [Then after three or four days which included a fistfight and Vinny’s nose being broken, DiGaetano and the two paratroopers were found.] This MP from Brooklyn, from Sand Street, Puerto Rican guy, said, “Let’s see your pass.” I had my hand in my pocket and I take it out and he said, “What the hell happened to your hand?”\nI said, “I’m getting sent back to the line.”\nHe said, “What are you kidding? They wouldn’t send you back like that.”\nI said, “Why not? They did.”\nThe MP was looking for these German paratroopers who were dropped behind the lines. We were out of uniform. We had combat boots but we didn’t have no helmets. We had soft hats. The uniform was leggings, and helmet liners, and stuff like that. We didn’t have that and they knew our uniform that way. [So DiGaetano and the paratroopers looked suspicious and Vinny ended up at the 1st Division stockade.\nA captain was the head of the stockade there. I don’t even know who the hell he is, he was from the First Division, but I recognized him. On D-Day, he had gotten a bad wound. His face was all he must have got hit by shrapnel in his face. He had to be one of our captains from another company. I recognized the guy and then he saw my 1st Division patch and we started talking. He said, “I’d like to keep you here but I can’t. I got to get rid of you.” I said, “How about keeping us here a couple of days?”\nMy bedroll was broken open after the Hürtgen forest [and everything was stolen]. I had a luger and a dagger the officer’s used to wear, the silver dagger they had. I had one of them. And I had a pair of binoculars. They were really great.\nI happened to get the binoculars, there was a German guy who was dead and he was upside down and the binoculars were hanging over. So I went over there took the binoculars off him. He was probably an artillery observer. They were big glasses. He was just upside down against a fence or something like that. We were flying through the town [and Vinny just reached out and snatched them on the run\nWounded a third time\nAfter I came back from the hospital, after the Bulge, I got a piece of shrapnel but I wouldn’t go back. I think it was shrapnel from artillery. But it wasn’t like a big piece. A little small piece I got it in my leg.\nI think Bianchi pulled it out with my knife. I always had my knife with me. Then he put it in for a Purple Heart because the medics used to do that. At that time, we didn’t get nothing for a Purple Heart. Later on we got five points or something [toward separation\nThe 16th Infantry were still in Belgium, we were on the outside, the left hand side of the Bulge. The First Division and the Ninth Division were the two divisions they couldn’t get through.\nAfter the Bulge, the 16th Infantry pushed to the Rhine in the vicinity of the Remagen Bridge.] We were on the other side of the Remagen Bridge, and we took one of the towns. At the time there was an order, you’re not supposed to fraternize. Me and Ray Christman were trying to make out with this German girl.\nSo some guy comes by from way in the back, some outfit back maybe one of those support units back there. He says, “You’re not supposed to be fraternizing, what’s your rank, I’m going to report you.” So he goes, “Where’s your CP?”\nWe say, “Over there, about a block down.”\nOur captain says to this guy, “Well, I’ll tell you. We have four or five towns to take.” We were taking about three or four towns a day on the other side of the Remagen Bridge, trying to make a beachhead over there. And the captain said, “If they both live, I’ll bust both of them.”\nSo that guy who reported us didn’t know whether to s– or go blind. If they live, I’ll bust both of them. [Laughs\nOn the other side of there is where Bianchi got killed. He was assigned to us a lot. He could’ve moved from company to company, but he always seemed to be with E Company that I remember.\nVinny paused and asked if I’d found his name in the records. I said, yes, his first name was Gerald. Vinny said, “I think you might be right about that. We always called him, Hey, Bianci, you know? But Gerald sounds familiar.”\nWhen we were in the bridgehead there, a jeep pulls up and everybody thought the guy was a general because he was clean shaven. But it was my brother-in-law, Hank Canone. He was with the 9th Armored Division and had been at Bastogne his first time in combat.\nHe was looking for me all over the bridgehead and finally found me. I was standing there, rolling a severed human finger back and forth with my foot. And I said, “Hey, Hank, look at this.” He was married to my sister, Stella.\nI made sergeant by elimination. Because as guys got eliminated, they needed men, experienced men, and they made you sergeant.\nI said that not everyone made sergeant, he must have known what he was doing. He said, “Yeah, I guess, in a sense.”\nYou spend so much time trying to take care of yourself. A couple of times it was offered and I said, “I just want to take of myself, I don’t want to be bothered with that.”A lot of guys, a lot of the fellows, said I don’t want to be a sergeant. Because you don’t have to worry about your whole squad. You just worry about yourself.\nAs a sergeant:] They would call you and say, We’re going to go into this town. We’re going to be here, your squad is going to be here, and your squad’s going to be there. You didn’t go in cold.\nI remember the first couple of days in combat we had night patrols. They were scary bastards, boy. Like going out on patrol at night past your line, like they wanted some intelligence. We couldn’t wait to get back.\nGo out and see if you could take a prisoner. But you’d go out so far and the sergeant would say, “Come on, let’s go back. Let’s go.” You had to go out there at least half a mile or something like that in front of your own line and you hear all kind of crap.\nYou had the moonlight, you could see a little bit. But if something starts, you can’t tell who’s shooting at who. All of a sudden, firing starts and you’re shooting all over the frigging place. You don’t know if you’re shooting at your own man or not. Let’s get the hell out of here. It’s a tough thing.\nWounded for the last time\nWe were close to Czechoslovakia, about two weeks before the war ended, and a Screaming Meemie picked me up, threw me up straight up in the air. I was unconscious for 24 hours, Then I was dazed and couldn’t hear. Couldn’t hear for almost a week. They sent me to a hospital [in France] and the doctor says, “You’ll be okay.” And I says, “I can’t hear nothing.” I had ringing in my ears. He said, “You’re going to be okay.” Fortunately, he was right.\nSometime later] The chaplain come over and he says, “Are you Mr. DiGaetano?” I said, “What’s happened?” Turns out my sister wrote the Red Cross because I hadn’t written home for two or three months.\nAt the end, they wanted to send the 1st Division over to Japan. I couldn’t believe it! I was ready to desert then. I didn’t have enough points to get out because I didn’t have enough time in the army. My time in the army was very limited. I only had 33 months in the army: two years overseas. I got the Purple Heart and three clusters. And five campaigns. You get a certain amount of points for each campaign. I had a number of points but not enough to keep me from going to Japan. Frig that. I ain’t going to Japan.\nAnd he didn’t. Vinny was in the hospital when he heard that we had dropped the atom bomb.\nThe atom bomb was a horrible thing. But still in all, let’s get this thing over with. They’re the ones that started it. We didn’t start it. I’m sure if they had the atom bomb, they wouldn’t have hesitated a second to use it.\nThe war’s long effects: Vinny and Chris DiGaetano in conversation\nVinny’s wife Chris joined the conversation and I’ve transcribed their words as faithfully as possible (and omitted my questions as it slowed down the text).\nChris:Vinny never really did spoke about the war. Maybe he’d joke. But he had nightmares, he really did.\nVinny: In the beginning, yeah\nChris: He had a lot of nightmares. In the middle of the night, all of a sudden you’d find him sitting bolt upright, angry as all hell, and you think he’s awake but it’s in his subconscious. We were up in Times Square, and we were walking up in the theater district, by the Paramount, and a truck backfired. I was walking along and where the hell is he? He had run behind a car, like we were being bombed. He was down on his hands and knees. I didn’t want to embarrass him. And I said, “It’s just a truck, Vinny.” You know, it’s sad. Because he’s like the strong one and to see him crumble was sad.\nVinny: My first job was in printing shop. They cut the paper, it goeszzzzooooowwhhh. Sounded just like when you’re getting artillery fire. I start diving underneath the table. So a guy says, “So you were in the infantry. He said the first couple times he heard it, he was diving under the table too. He said it takes about a week and a half to get used to that sound.\nChris: Vinny’s cousin was with Special Services. They made recordings. And he came [to a family gathering] with this record of the Screaming Meemies and he wanted Vinny to hear. It was when we were first married. We didn’t even have children yet.\nChris: And Vinny’s sitting there. All of a sudden he was like, You gotta stop it, you gotta stop it soon because I’ll kill him and I’ll break the machine. I said, “What? What happened?” He said, “That’s the noise I heard!”\nVinny: I hate those Screaming Meemies. You could hear them for miles away. oeeerrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr then you don’t hear nothing.\nChris: And then there’s an explosion.\nVinny: It wasn’t like an artillery shell, you could hear them coming in [all the way]. But we called them Screaming Meemies because we’d hear them yaaahhhoowwwweeeeerr.\nChris: Then silence and then boom.\nVinny: Then it blows up, bowwwrrrrrmmm, because they were like bombs. I used to hate the noise.\nChris: And this cousin thought it was so, wow, look what I got. He got such a charge out bringing all those war sounds. “This is wonderful, you have to hear this.” What the hell is he doing? And then Vinny blew, “I’ll kill him!” You were really yelling that night. What was wrong with him? Why would he record something like that?\nVinny: The Screaming Meemie guy, he was married to my first cousin.\nChris: He didn’t want to see Vinny after that. He said, “If that nut is going to be there, I’m not going.”\nVinny: We never saw him after that. Once or twice maybe. Hardly ever.\nChris: I think your cousin divorced him eventually.\nVinny: Smartest thing she’s done probably.\nChris: That’s a shame, that one [Phil Streczyk] who committed suicide after the war? I wonder if he ever got help. Because Vinny went for treatment for therapy, for eight or ten years, didn’t you, Vinny?\nVinny: Once a week. Kings County Hospital, I used to go. That’s a big hospital, like Bellevue.\nChris: Psychiatric ward.\nVinny: It was good.\nChris: I think it helped. When he came back from those sessions, he’d be laughing.\nVinny: The doctor would be like, “Did your father hit you?” “Yeah.”In those days, if your father hit you it was nothing.\nChris: It wasn’t his father hitting him, it was the Germans. He’d come back and say, “You should see all those crazy people hanging out the windows.” I said, “You’d better keep going or you’ll be joining them.” Maybe [Streczyk] didn’t go for treatment. Sometimes it does help when you can talk man-to-man, someone who’s professional. They can help you out. Vinny always used to give way to his outbursts. My mother used to say, “Don’t get him angry because he’ll get away with it. He’s crazy. He’s got it on the record that he’s nuts.”\nVinny: Her mother used to say, “Leave him alone, he’s crazy.”\nI asked Chris why she married Vinny despite the problems and her family’s misgivings. She shrugged and laughed and said, “I thought he looked like Robert Mitchum.”\nBefore this conversation took place, Phil Streczyk’s daughter, Phyllis, had called DiGaetano. She wanted to talk with someone who knew her father, and I gave her Vinny’s number. So she called and was nervous at first but soon they were talking like old friends. Phyllis read Vinny parts of Stephen E. Ambrose’s D-Day over the phone.]\nVinny: I never knew I was in that book. I never knew that. He [Spalding] must have had a list of everybody in the platoon.\nI said that Spalding did or the interviewers did. I had a copy of the interview with me. I quoted from it, “Pfc. Vincent DiGaetano, who was carrying a 72 pound flamethrower, yelled and said, I’m drowning, what do you want me to do with this flamethrower”. Streczyk told him to drop it.” Vinny laughed.\nThen I read, “DiGaetano was hit in the butt by shrapnel fire” Vinny laughed again, and so did Chris.\nChris:Oh, Vinny, there was so much blood it’s understandable they got that idea. [Chris paused and then said:] So what were you, retreating?", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}

My daughter thrived and Alice began on Sundays she was free reffing games. She took on coaching the girls team when we moved to Horsham Sparrows. Seeing her pass on her love for football was inspiring - however I could tell she still wasn’t entirely fulfilled. I encouraged her to try out for the women’s side. Alice in the 10 years she hadn’t played was a little nervous - in that time she had totally lost sight in one eye due to a fluke medical condition. She had already left the kitchen because of it, but she began playing again and I have never seen her so happy - I can possibly get a little put out that she picks football over me - but in the year she has been back playing she won coach’s player the first season and now in second to captain the team when she can.

{"id": "5412", "text": "Even before Chairman Tom Wheeler proposed to issue a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) on possible new net neutrality rules to replace the ones vacated by the D.C. Cir. the May 15 Open Meeting of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) promised to be one of the more important meetings in recent memory. As a result, it has become one of the more contentious in recent memory as well.\nIn addition to the net neutrality NPRM, we have an Order deciding key issues for the upcoming incentive auction (aka the 600 MHz auction, aka that really complicated thing where we pay broadcasters to get off spectrum they got for free by simultaneously selling it to wireless companies for mobile broadband). This mega item has two fairly important side pieces from my perspective: the future of unlicensed use in the TV broadcast bands (aka the TV white spaces (TVWS) aka “super wifi” aka “engineers will never be allowed to name anything ever again”) and possible limits on how much spectrum any one company can acquire (aka the “no piggies rule” aka spectrum aggregation policies aka “lawyers are not allowed to name anything ever again either”). The TVWS item has its own satellite proceeding about wireless microphones and coexistence between wireless mics and unlicensed use in an ever shrinking broadcast band.\nSo for those of you first timers, and those of you who have gone so long without a contentious FCC meeting you’ve forgotten how it’s done, I’ve prepared this helpful guide on “what is an open FCC meeting and how does it work.”\nMechanics of the meeting below . . .\nWhat is an FCC Open Meeting?\nThis will no doubt seem confusing to those who just popped in for the net neutrality stuff and who would think, from the bulk of the coverage, that Chairman Wheeler is Supreme Dictator and gets to make all the decision himself. Not so much.\nThe FCC is an independent Commission. It has 5 members, no more than 3 of whom can be from the same political party. The current members (in addition to Chairman Wheeler (D)) are: Mingon Clyburn (D), Jessica Rosenworcel (D), Ajit Pai (R) and Mike O’Rielly (R)).\nBy law, the FCC must meet at least once each calendar month. Under the Government In The Sunshine Act, all Commission meetings are open to the public. If you plan to attend, you will need government issue i.d. (like an airport) to get into the building. The meeting starts at 10:30 a.m., but expect crowds. (Hopefully crowds of protesters outside as well, GO OCCUPY FCC! You are what democracy and an engaged citizenship looks like.) If you don’t want to brave the crowd, you can watch the livestream on the FCC’s website.\nHow Does An Open FCC Meeting Work?\nAt the meeting, the Chair will call the meeting to order, ask the Secretary to read the agenda, whereupon the Secretary will read the first item on the agenda.\nSitting in front of the Commission is a table where sit the FCC staff charged with presenting the item. The relevant staffer will read a summary of the item. The staffer will close with “staff request editorial privileges” which is a code word for “we may not actually have finished writing the item, especially if there was a bunch of last minute negotiation. We promise to get it written and circulated to all of you for sign off before we issue it to the public.”\nBecause of this, it may take some time for the actual item voted to appear on the FCC’s website or be publicly available. In recent years, the FCC has generally been pretty good about getting stuff up in a day or two. But it can take weeks, especially if the Commissioners don’t think the actual language of the Order reflects their understanding and they have multiple edits and wordsmithing.\nThe Chair will then open the floor to each Commissioner in turn, by seniority, to make comments/read an official statement. The batting Order is: Clyburn, Rosenworcel, Pai, O’Rielly. (It is coincidence that at the moment this is divided by party, with the Republicans all junior to the Democrats by seniority.) Then the Chairman will have the opportunity to make a statement. After that, the Chairman calls for a formal vote and each Commissioner votes.\nSo They Don’t Actually Debate The Item Or Edit The Item At The Meeting? What A Rip Off!\nYeah, life’s like that. Negotiation takes place before the meeting and this is theater. But it is important theater. Forcing the Commissioners to do their voting in public actually matters, and makes them accountable for how they vote.\nHow Do Members Of the Public Get To Speak?\nYou don’t. Sorry. Under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and the Government In The Sunshine Act, the Commissioners vote on the record of the proceeding, which closes in advance of the public meeting. The agenda for the meeting must be published in advance. Usually, the record closes (and therefore the public has no further ability to add to the record) a week before the meeting when the agenda is posted. The FCC waived that for the net neutrality item so the public could comment until the last minute.\nBut this is not an “open meeting” like a town hall where the FCC gathers evidence. This is like a floor vote in Congress. You get to watch the action but the outcome is usually determined in advance.\nSo What Happens After the Vote?\nAfter covering all 4 items, the Chair will then open the floor for any further business. This is usually the opportunity when Commissioners acknowledge departing staff or introduce incoming staff or have other non-substantive items.\nThe Chairman will then gavel the meeting to a close and all the telecom insiders and the assembled press will mill around and gossip with each other, compare style notes, speculate about stuff, and generally do our insider clique thing that every regular gathering of human beings has done since the first cave dwellers got together to decide where to migrate next.\nAnything In The End Credits?\nAfter a few minutes, the Chair or other high ranking FCC official usually has a press conference to answer questions about the items and whatever other random questions reporters want to ask. You can bet someone will ask about the possible AT&T/DIRECTV deal, the possible Sprint/TMO deal, possible variations of either deal involving DISH, and other stuff that no one can answer because it isn’t in front of the FCC yet. We’ll also have lots of questions about Comcast/TWC/Charter, where the only thing the FCC will do is confirm or deny that they are waiting for the companies to file an application for the Charter deal before going ahead with the public notice and getting the ball rolling.\nThe press conference also gets streamed, so you won’t miss it if you watch at home. No, I do not have an FCC press conference drinking game, but if you do develop one, please link to it in the comments. No, Riff Trax does not do the FCC meeting, but I try to fill in for this loss by live tweeting (twitter handle=haroldfeld)\nStay tuned . . . .", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

{"id": "5456", "text": "When you use small beads in a bracelet, it’s quite easy to get your beads to lie right next to each other with no gaps revealing your beading string. With larger beads, however, it is more tricky to achieve that. And some handmade African beads present added challenges.\nThe fancy recycled glass tube bead bracelets have a cetain simplicity and charm, perhaps the reason they are among our bestsellers. They are unusual and yet very easy to make, if you can select the right combination of beads.\nThese are much larger beads ranging in length from 10 to 25 or even 30mm and sometimes in spite of my best efforts initial attemps do not yield the results I am looking for. And the simple project I had in mind takes more thought and time to complete.\nWhy Problem Occurs:\nI notice three reasons why the gaps occur:\n- Shape of beads\n- Length of some beads\n- Length of the bracelet, and\n- Size and Placement of bead holes\nShape of Beads\nUsually the beads are slightly curved so they lie nicely next to each in a bracelet. Sometimes, though you get a few beads even on the same strand which aren’t that shape. Instead of the usualy curve they are quite straight.\n- By far the simplest way out is change the offending bead(s), if I have the right replacement (s), that is. If, however, I have not suitable alternative tube beads(s) then:\n- Add spacers – usually discs, or smaller beads such as seed beads. It will change the original design, but much better alternative to gaps in the bracelet. For the width of the tube beads, I find the disc spacers are more suitable. You could of course try round beads in the right size too.\nLength of the Beads/Bracelet Length\nThe shorter, 20-22mm curved beads work quite well especially in a short bracelet but in a longer piece the gapping is likely to occur even if all the beads are the right shape. For the 7- inch bracelet below, not only is the bracelet longer, but I used longer 25-28mm tube beads too.\nSize and Placement of Bead Holes:\nUneven-sized and or off-centre holes can also cause your beads not to align properly in a bracelet. In first photo below, circled in red, is a bead hole which doesn’t quite sit in the centre of the bead. And it is the reason that bead does not align with the blue disc bead next to it. Middle photo shows a close-up of the offending hole. I am using a 1mm wide beading cord and this hole is the largest at 3mm wide. Not only is it bigger than all the others; it is also placed closer to the edge of the bead.\nTo get my beading cord in the centre in this case, I do two things:\n- Use a piece of hollow beading tube\n- Cut a tad shorter than length of the bead\n- pass the elastic beading cord through it before threading that bead onto it.\nThere is still a small gap to one side which leads me onto the next step.\n2. Get rid of the extra space and to force the elastic to stay in the centre.\n- Fit in another piece of the tube next to the first (holding the cord)\n- Finally add a tad of beading glue as needed to prevent the tube and ‘filler’ from showing\nThe final result is much more pleasing to the eye. True, I ended up with a different design but it’s preferable it to the alternative.", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}

Customer experience management remains one of Zain Group’s keys strategic pillars, with the company investing heavily in the area in order to maintain the highest quality of service for its customers.\nThe Customer Engagement Forum focused on areas of customer experience management and topics of discussion included Customer Centricity and Complaint Management; Channel Economics; Change and Knowledge Management; Social Care as well as a dedicated session and focus on Zain’s brand and digital online future strategic direction.\nKey presentations were made to the Zain management by leading global and regional technology providers specialized in the customer management arena showcasing the latest solutions available, namely Cybermak, Matrixx, Qelp, ResponseTek and Sestek. In addition, innovative end-to-end mobility digital services provider FOO Solutions, the entity that Zain recently acquired a strategic stake in, showcased how mobile apps can be at the center of customer services.\nThe Forum was led by Zain Group CEO, Scott Gegenheimer, and Group Chief Commercial Officer, Duncan Howard who have been strong advocates for the Group’s focus on customer experience management, having overseen a number of key initiatives in the area recently.\nCommenting on the successful conclusion of the Forum, Scott Gegenheimer said, “In today’s competitive telecom landscape, customer experience management is as important to the sustainable success of a telco as technical innovation and investment. At Zain, we take this area of our business very seriously and are developing it as one of our key differentiators. As a Group of operations we benefit from differing experiences in our respective markets, and it is important to be able to gather regularly and share knowledge and insights in settings such as the Customer Engagement Forum.”\nZain is set to continue to develop its laser-like focus on simplicity and operational efficiency, with customer experience remaining an important factor in driving commercial success. Retaining customers is vital and Zain strives to deliver the best experience in order to achieve this. Elements within Zain Group’s customer experience management program include the quality of its network, delivery of value-added services, as well as the improvement of all customer touchpoints.\nIn an example of Zain Group’s heightened investment in customer experience management-related activities, last year the Group and its country operations introduced a series of analytical tools and activities aimed at heightening customer satisfaction levels, the results of which are proving positive.\nZain’s holding of regular Customer Week exercises forms part of the company’s ongoing commitment to delivering the best-in-class customer experience, and was conducted across all Zain Group markets simultaneously. Zain personnel, including business chiefs, directors, managers, and general staff interacted closely with customers during the week through different activities arranged in conjunction with the local customer experience teams.\nAcross its markets, each quarter approximately 150-200 members of Zain Group’s management participate in Customer Day (Voice of the Customer) activities whereby the company conducts customer-related activities that take place in each of its markets, where management teams participate in customer-related activities including serving in retail, answering calls in contact centers, social media chats, corporate customer visits, on-site base station visits with engineers, and so on. At the end of each session, management teams meet to discuss their observations and a list of actions are created to determine what needs to continue to improve.\nZain has also implemented an internal customer survey feedback platform, which continues to be rolled out across markets, providing deep insights on customers’ key interactions. When customers interact with the company through a visit to a branch or when calling customer service, they soon thereafter receive a SMS based survey that addresses questions related to satisfaction with the interaction, effort required to handle their request, agent knowledge to deal with their interaction and more.\nThese real-time insights have enabled Zain country operations to continue to shape their plans to drive the right results ultimately aimed at reducing customer effort and increasing both customer satisfaction and net promoter score. The real-time tool has now launched in five markets, with the remaining markets due to go live this year.\nAdditionally, members of the Customer Care and Customer Experience community across Zain Group participated in the Global CEM accreditation training as part of bi-annual forums undertaken by the company. The interactive training was aimed at continuing to develop capabilities and skills related to customer experience and required participants to submit an examination assignment in order to be accredited. Many of Zain’s community members are now certified in Global CEM as a result.", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

{"id": "5556", "text": "Benzinga, a media and data provider bridging the gap between retail and institutional investors, will be bringing back its annual Global Fintech Awards event to New York City on Dec. 8, 2022.\nAhead of this recognition of disruptive innovators in finance and technology, Benzinga will periodically publish articles on those brands that it thinks are making a measurable impact.\nToday’s conversation is with Brian Hyndman, the president, and CEO of Blue Ocean Technologies, the firm allowing people to manage risk in equity markets 24-hours a day.\nThe following text was edited for clarity and concision.\nQ: Hey Brian, nice to speak with you. Tell me a little bit about yourself.\nBrian Hyndman: I got into electronic trading in 1998 when we started Brut ECN, and we were competing against incumbent exchanges.\nNasdaq Inc NDAQ ended up acquiring us in 2004 and, at Nasdaq, I was responsible for running the exchange platform, as well as product and sales efforts.\nWe ended up acquiring the Island ECN, along with the Boston and Philadelphia Stock Exchange, which put Nasdaq on the map. Prior, they were a quasi-government agency, falling behind in technology and losing market share to startups.\nWhen Nasdaq got back into the driver’s seat, I moved over and ran their global data business. I more than doubled the revenue to $550 million six years later and, eventually, found my way to Paxos, a leading crypto firm.\nWhen did Blue Ocean come into the picture?\nAfter three years as a senior adviser at Paxos, I came across the Blue Ocean guys needing to raise capital. I was intrigued by the idea of U.S. equities trading 24-hours a day.\nI joined and we raised $10 million from Urbana. Over the course of the past year, we proved out the model that global investors want the ability to manage their risk at all hours of the day.\nTell me a little bit about the infrastructure and how I, as a retail participant, can access markets at any hour of the day.\nFirst, we’re a registered alternative trading (ATS) system approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\nAnybody who is a FINRA registered broker-dealer can access the platform.\nIt’s just like the Nasdaq system. Nasdaq can’t go directly to retail. They have to go to the broker-dealer like Charles Schwab Corporation-owned SCHW TD Ameritrade, through which retail then comes.\nIf a retail investor is on your platform, and they have the desire to connect, they come through that FINRA registered broker-dealer that is subscribed to our Blue Ocean ATS.\nWhat’s the motivation behind 24-hour trading?\nBack in the day, when I was at Nasdaq, I wanted to start 24-hour trading, but people at the large investment banks wanted to go home at 5:00 p.m.\nThe world has changed and now everybody has the infrastructure in place due to crypto and their offices overseas in Hong Kong and Singapore.\nWe have a transparent asset class, trading maybe 12.5 billion shares during a six-and-a-half-hour period. We think giving investors in, for example, Asia, that ability to trade during their daytime hours, would add to that liquidity, substantially.\nGot it on the technology side.

{"id": "5560", "text": "Every sports fan experiences an adrenaline rush when their favorite team is playing. You can feel the energy increase while the attackers chase a goal. And you get to the edge of your seat once your team is at risk of losing.\nIf you’re like many sports fans, you’ve predicted a handful of matches correctly. Maybe you predicted last year’s Super Bowl winners correctly. Or perhaps you rightly backed Daniil Medvedev to win the US Open last September.\nAll the same, it’s one thing to predict one match correctly. It’s a different ballgame to do it over and over. In light of that information, below is a list of factors to keep in mind when betting on sports.\nSports betting odds are a reflection of what sportsbooks believe will happen in a match. Usually, bookmakers have odds for the home team, a draw or the away team.\nNowadays, you can find tons of things to bet on in a single match. There’s the total number of points or goals, correct scores, goal scorers, half-time leaders, second half leaders and proposition bets.\nRegardless of what you plan to bet on, check the odds given by your favorite sportsbook. If you don’t have a reliable bookmaker, check out bestbettingsites.com for a guide on the best USA betting sites.\nStill on odds, learn to find high-value odds. You see, bookmakers don’t provide fair odds all the time. A match where England has 1.15 odds to beat Monrovia (12.00) won’t make you good money.\nHowever, a game in which France has 2.5 odds to beat Croatia (3.2) could provide great value. Here, you have a chance to double or triple your money depending on which side you pick.\nIn every sports competition, there are three types of teams or players. There’s the team in excellent form. Think of the current division leaders in the NBA, NFL or the NHL.\nThen there’s the team in terrible form—teams fighting relegation, and tournament knockouts. The last type of team is the inconsistent kind. It wins some. Next, is spirals into a losing streak.\nWith that in mind, it’s easy to know where a team or player falls as far as form is concerned. Start by checking the logs. If you’re wagering on a Major League Game, check the division and conference rankings.\nIf you want to bet on international football, check the tables. Logically, the top teams after a few matches are in great form. By comparison, last-placed teams are in terrible form.\nWhich team should you bet on? Avoid inconsistent teams. Instead, bet on clubs in great or poor form. Keep in mind there are numerous bet types, so you can always wager against a bottom-placed side\nHead to Head Records\nThe next factor to consider before you bet on a team is to check the head to head records. Let’s say the away team has beaten the home team in the last ten matches, regardless of the tournament.\nThere’s a high likelihood they will again. But this isn’t always a guarantee. Due to that, some betting experts advise beginners to not pay much attention to this factor.\nA team might have lost to its opponent in the last four matches. But maybe the opponent is fielding inexperienced players this time. Perhaps it’s the finals and each team will perform at its level best.\nAs such, look at head to head records for a feint idea of which team will be the favorite. Also, it helps you discover data about the average number of points/goals scored, top scorers and playing styles.\nIf two teams usually score each other constantly when they meet, you can expect a high-scoring game.\nOverall Team Quality\nSure, Nottingham Forest defeated Barcelona in 1980. But do you really believe Forest’s current crop of players can defeat Barca? This is why it’s important to compare the quality of players and coaches in both sides.\nGenerally speaking, teams with better players tend to win. This isn’t always the case, though. As such, don’t underestimate the underdogs. Instead, look at its players and their performance in the last few games.\nHave they upset any big team recently? Have they frustrated any side in the top four even if they lost? In other words, look at the overall quality of a team. If one team is superior in quality and has been winning consistently, you have a potential winner.\nTournament and Schedule\nWhich tournament are you betting on? Because if it’s a minor competition, many top teams field their rotation players. Alternatively, they might become complacent and underestimate their opponents.\nAnother factor that could affect a team’s performance is its schedule. A tight schedule will usually force coaches to alternate players. And this means there could be a game where a good franchise has players with little chemistry on the field.\nAgainst that backdrop, choose a tournament. Preferably, pick a major competition like the Major League. Then find a team with the least congested schedule. Usually, this team will field its best players even when facing a much weaker opponent.\nKeep in mind the stakes are often high in big games. Every team wants to win or rescue a point. As such, you have to research comprehensively before you place a bet.\nInjuries, Lineups and Motivation\nPlenty of things can affect the outcome of a sports game. Let’s start with injuries. If key defenders, midfielders or attackers are out with injury, a team’s quality reduces. In turn, this reduces its chances of winning.\nNext is the lineup. An NBA team could be leading in the Western Conference. But if it benches its best players, its chances of winning reduce drastically. Motivation also influences a team, especially in important games.\nIf a team is fighting for a playoff spot against a team that’s already qualified, it will be more motivated. Likewise, a team that’s already knocked out of a competition will have little to fight for. Keep these factors in mind when deciding how to place a bet.", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}
{"id": "5579", "text": "Checking out yourself fifteen times before stepping out of the house is a general proposition for girls. However, men are also very conscious about their looks, but girls are crazy. Their confidence relies on how they look and what people think about them. Knowing that this kind of stereotype is poison to the society, but still, nothing changes. Beauty gives them the power to come up with their ideas and paint their world brighter. Some of them will always have a set of makeup in their bags. But what if the makeup is not working? What if your features are not that sharp and good? Do not worry. There is a solution for that too.\nBelow is detailed information about the botox lip flip before and after, which can help you to increase the prominence of any feature of your face.\nTable of Contents\nWhat is Botox?\nBotulinum Toxin, which is generally called botox, contains OnabotulinumtoxinA. This chemical does not harm your skin and is completely safe if not manipulated by the patient or doctor after it is injected. Botox is generally used to remove fine lines and wrinkles on the forehead. It maintains the toxicity of the skin on the face as, with time, the skin becomes saggy, giving cheeks a saggy look. The botox is minimally invasive and hence causes no physical or chemical issues if done right. It stays minimally for four months, but after that, it can be maintained with additional botox inserted sometimes.\nPreparation of botox lip flip before and after\nPreparing the patient before the treatment is necessary. Communicating with the patient is a great method of building trust between the patient and the doctor. It pulls out the fear from the patient, which helps them to relax their skin, and the treatment goes well. What else can be done to prepare the patient even more?\n- Counselling of the patient can be done to lower her stress for botox lip flip before and after. The doctor must explain the procedure to the patient so that, when needed are used, the patient does not get panicked. The patient must be told about the before and aftercare of the botox treatment so that nothing goes wrong.\n- The patient must be asked about her previous experiences in the hospital. This leads the doctor to know what kind of patient he is dealing with.\n- The patient should be asked questions about her allergies to know if botox will be a good idea or not.\n- The doctor must inform the patient to not use makeup for at least 2 to 3 weeks. This makes the skin clear and chemical-free. On such skin, botox can be injected.\n- The patient should be told not to take any medication before Botox treatment, especially blood thinning and drugs like aspirin.\n- If the patient has undergone any surgery recently, the doctor must avoid the botox treatment and give the patient time to heal completely.\nHow does botox lip flip before and after work?\nWhen it comes to how botox lip flip before and after works, maybe the below-given information fills up for your cravings.\nThe Botulinum toxin A is used. It is injected into the areas where illness or toning of the skin is required. It is injected at the forehead, cheekbones, under the eye, and on the lips as a filler.\nIt is the safest method and is non-surgical. The injection also remains superficially and does not affect the deeper tissues keeping them healthy enough.\nBotox blocks the nerve signals which stimulate the skin contraction. This results in the relaxed muscles leaving the skin wrinkle-free. It also slows down the formation of fine lines giving your face a young look.\nGenerally, 3-4 injections are given to the patient, and the procedure is finished within 2 to 3 minutes.\nKey Difference of Botox on Lip: Before And After\nThere is a huge difference in botox of the lip before and after. Botox works as a filler when injected into the lip and gives the lip a younger look.\nComing on to its procedure. After the preparation of the patient is done. The patient is seated and is told to relax their lip muscles. The botox is injected into the lip in small parts. Multiple injections are given to the lip. Talking about the site of injection, the botox is injected in the upper centre of the upper lip. It is injected at the vermilion border also. And some parts of the botox are also inserted into the orbicularis oris muscle.\nThis curls up the upper lip and creates fullness in it. This causes the lip to elevate.\nThe patient needs to pay attention after the treatment is done. She should not touch the area injected as it can let the botox spread into other areas. She should sit in an upright posture for at least 4 hours. This will help the botox stay still in the area where it was injected. There will be swelling for 2 to 3 days, and the lips will become in a way you desired for them.\nThe Final Verdict\nWe hope now you have a complete understanding of botox and botox of the lip before and after. This before-and-after difference is wonderful if done right or can cause you great trouble. So find the right doctor for yourself and get it done.\nKriti Sharma, a seasoned content writer, my passion for words fuels my writing journey.

{"id": "5613", "text": "- If you're normally neat, a messy room could be a sign that your mental health is in a tough spot.\n- If the mess bothers you or you're worried, you may want to speak with a qualified professional.\n- But if the mess doesn’t bother you, it’s probably no big deal.\nWhether you were a little kid who just couldn't be bothered to clean your room unless told to do so, a college student who let things slip whenever a big paper or exam rolled around, or an adult who sometimes leaves dishes in the sink, chances are, you've made or ignored a mess.\nNormally, you might not think that this means anything other than that you're short on time. And that can, in fact, be all there is to it. Having a messy room doesn't necessarily mean that there's anything else going on in terms of your mental health, but, in some cases, it can indicate something more serious.\n\"Some people simply don't value cleanliness and they prioritize other things over keeping a room clean,\" Weena Cullins, a marriage and family therapist, told INSIDER. \"When you think about it, there's a mundaneness and a monotony with keeping up with tasks like this that need to be completed routinely without much more benefit to them than returning to a clean room, so sometimes a refusal to keep a room clean is more about that than anything else.\"\nA messy room can also be a sign that you have depression.\nSeveral of the criteria for a depression diagnosis — hopelessness, fatigue, and lack of concentration — can all play a role in why your messy room is in the state it's in. Cullins explained that, in the case of fatigue, many times you're struggling to get out of bed. \"If you can barely get out of the bed, it's unlikely that you have the energy to clean your room,\" she added.\nIf you're feeling a little less than hopeful, you might have a hard time understanding why you should even bother to clean up or organize things since, from where you're standing, everything seems to be going wrong anyway. Cullins noted that, for people with depression, it can be a \"struggle to find joy or see a light at the end of a dark tunnel.\" If it's not going to help anything, why even try?\nLack of concentration, too, can make the actual task of cleaning up your room impossible.\n\"While it may sound strange to forget to clean up your room since you're reminded of the condition of the room each day, depression can make you easily distracted,\" Cullins said. \"So you can intend to put things in order in your room and never find the concentration or the energy to get around to it because you have so many other things going on.\"\nEven if you don't recognize that you fit the criteria for an official diagnosis of depression (or just plain don't fit the criteria) if you're overwhelmed or have a lot going on in your head, cleaning your room can still be a major challenge.\n\"Sometimes when life feels out of control or stressful other areas of your life get affected one being your working or living space,\" Kimberly Hershenson, a therapist, told INSIDER. \"If you're depressed or overwhelmed with life you may feel you don't have time to clean/organize, you may feel you don't deserve a clean space or you may be so preoccupied with other things you don't even notice how messy your room has become.\"\nIf you're concerned that the messiness of your bedroom, kitchen, or any other room in your living space might mean that there's something going on mental health-wise, the first thing you might want to do is speak with a qualified professional who can help you sort out what's going on. A therapist, counselor, or even your primary care physician could all help you or, at least, point you in the right direction.\nAdditionally, Hershenson noted that you don't have to try to tackle the whole mess all at once. \"Set a goal to do one small task a day to clean up your space whether it's putting the dishes in the dishwasher or making your bed,\" she said. \"Thinking about cleaning everything at once may be too much so start small.\" This approach will help it feel much more manageable.\nBut just because your room is messy, doesn't mean you have depression, of course.\nAs Cullins noted, some people are simply uninterested in picking things up or don't prioritize or value making sure that they have a tidy space.\n\"If you're constantly hoping to stay more organized and keep the room clean, but find yourself unable to do it for other reasons, that's when you know that it's time for an intervention,\" Cullins said.\nReflect on why your room isn't cleaner. Is it because you just don't care whether it's clean or not or is it because, try as you might, you just can't clean it? And if you need help — ask for it.", "scores": {"score": 3, "score_transform_1": 5, "score_transform_2": 5, "score_transform_3": 0}}
{"id": "5615", "text": "Chic in the CityAuthor:Anh-Minh Le\nFor a California client’s pied-à-terre, Martin Kobus takes Manhattan\nWhen Martin Kobus was installing his Marin-based firm’s first New York project in the landmark Woolworth Tower Residences, And Just Like That…, the Sex and the City spin-off, was filming scenes a couple of floors above him. (That same apartment was apparently used as a set for Succession, too.) Only in New York, right?\nKobus’s client, similar to the And Just Like That… lead character played by Sarah Jessica Parker, has a passion for the sartorial, having worked as a tech/fashion executive for years. And like the TV series’ protagonist, she is also a single woman living in the city (albeit only part-time, as this is her pied-à-terre, with her main home now in Beverly Hills). Fittingly, according to Kobus, for her sleeping quarters, the client had one directive: sexy. “We wanted to make it more feminine and soft,” he says of the blush scheme, which includes a mural wallpaper, a faux-fur throw and shimmery velvet drapes. “It’s very tactile, with beautiful fabrics.”\nIn addition to the filming upstairs—“We were on a list to get into the building,” recalls Chris Bergin, Kobus’s partner in life and work—there were other aspects of the apartment’s location that made for unfamiliar territory for Kobus Interiors. Occupying about half of the 34th floor, the 3,800-square-foot unit required installation via an elevator. So the living room’s custom S-shaped double-sided sofa, spanning 16 and a half feet in length, was an especially memorable challenge. “We folded it in half—the base,” says Kobus. “It barely fit in the elevator.” (His retelling brings to mind another New York show: the episode of Friends in which Ross and Rachel unsuccessfully carry—and pivot—a sofa up the stairs.)\nThe Tribeca residence marks Kobus’ third under-taking with this client. He previously completed her Belvedere house, which was “much more airy and had a lighter palette; it was more California and was also about the water view—all the colors from the water and the sky,” he explains. While both projects are characterized by an abundance of natural light, as well as an emphasis on the homeowner’s art collection, the design concept in New York is decidedly “moody.” Having developed a trust with her, Kobus was essentially given carte blanche.\nIn the living room, a Julie Mehretu painting was the jumping-off point for the metallic and olive aesthetic choices. A flat white wall was transformed with four 12-by-4-foot églomisé panels created by San Francisco’s Villafranca Studio, which Kobus recessed between columns that he added for architectural interest. The sinuous custom rug by Scott Group Studio was somehow left off the truck that brought the furniture east to New York and—since it was one of the first items to be installed—had to be shipped overnight. Curves are a recurring theme in the living room, with the rug and double-sided sofa, plus another sofa covered in sheepskin, round metal nesting tables by Butler and a pair of lounge chairs by Pierre Paulin.\nThe motif continues in the adjacent dining room’s Kobus-designed furniture: a table composed of steel bases and an organic-shaped églomisé top (also the work of Villafranca Studio), surrounded by 3D-printed and resin-casted chairs in a smoky hue. As striking as these elements are, the pièce de résistance is Enso, a digital work by teamLab from Pace Gallery, which is on a loop that runs 18 minutes and 30 seconds. (Kobus, Bergin and photographer Douglas Friedman waited for just the right moment to capture the brush strokes of the circle.) The room also boasts a view “all the way up Broadway,” says Bergin.\nIn the hallway, Kobus leaned into the darkness—lining the walls and the ceiling with an Élitis design in charcoal, then painting the doors and trim to match. One section of the wall, in the foyer, is embellished with beading in an array of colors, giving the effect of flowers in bloom. “It’s like a beaded gown,” says Bergin. One of the apartment’s three bedrooms was converted into a media room that is awash in purple and gold. The room can still accommodate guests, however, thanks to a chic sofa bed designed by Kobus and upholstered in a Sahco ochre velour with a geometric pattern. The walls are sheathed in de Gournay’s Namban, a gilded paper with swirls and graphic lines, while the ceiling features Élitis’s Paradisio, whose aubergine tones are reflected in the Riflesso tables.\nIn Sex in the City Parker’s character, Carrie Bradshaw, once remarked that “in New York, you’re always looking for a job, a boyfriend or an apartment.” For Kobus’s client, with the completion of this project, at least one out of the three is settled—and spectacularly so.", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

There are no lines to follow precisely, and there is no ‘rule’ for when the stitching is done. You can make it as open or dense as you like.

Each entry point provides a nurturing entry to the School for new students, offering families a variety of options to best suit their son’s needs.\nReception to Year 2\nA caring and exciting environment awaits our youngest Churchie boys, whose energy and enthusiasm for learning is infectious and engaging. Boys begin learning to collaborate and express themselves, inspired by bright and cheerful classrooms, with an expert teacher and teacher aide in each classroom who have a genuine care and high regard for helping boys thrive at this important stage.\nAs boys progress through to Year 1 and Year 2, they grow and and their classroom environment grows with them. These years, while full of care and nurture, start to develop independence in boys to lay the foundation for formal years of learning ahead.\nSome of the highlights of this special time at Churchie are the annual Christmas Pageant and tailored age-appropriate cocurricular programmes, including chess, swimming and tennis.\nYears 3 and 4\nAn amazing journey awaits boys in Years 3 and 4 as they develop their independence, find their individual interests and begin to explore the many cocurricular activities and sports available at Churchie.\nBoys develop a lifelong love of learning through an engaging inquiry-based curriculum utilising the acclaimed International Baccalaureate Primary Years Programme.\nThe music immersion programme commences in Year 3, with every student learning a strings instrument. Through the 1:1 tablet programme, the boys begin to develop essential digital literacy and media arts skills in their everyday learning to lay the foundation for success in the years to come.\nAdditional opportunities through clubs and cocurricular programmes continue to engage and enthuse boys in their learning and the world around them.\nYears 5 and 6\nIn Year 5, Churchie welcomes a diverse community of students, with new boys joining the school from state and independent primary schools.\nBoys are beginning to see themselves as young men, encouraged to make a positive contribution to those around them and the world, through their ideas, their statements, their actions and their compassion. This is embodied in all aspects of the school, including community service, leadership opportunities, spiritual awareness and emotional development.\nA fantastic showcase of the Prep School journey is the PYP Exhibition, which is a culmination of a boys journey as a learner and global citizen. Boys learn essential core content while developing research skills, thinking skills, self-management skills and social skills, which will set them up for success in their high school years and beyond.\nYears 5 and 6 students can participate in the full array of sports and activities offered through the leading GPS schools network.\nLEARNing in the prep school\nin the prep school\nNAPLAN, QCE and IB\nPrep SChool News", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}
{"id": "5651", "text": "According to the latest survey from Statista, Women CIOs make up 25 percent of the Fortune 500’s top IT leaders, though women themselves make up about 50 percent of the population of the United States. It’s hardly parity. But it is progress, especially when considering that as recently as 1995, women represented only a token six percent of the top IT leadership positions in those same elite companies.\nWomen are making modest gains in the C-suite\nA more recent analysis from consulting firm Korn Ferry took a look at a broader sample of companies in a broader array of industries and found the numbers of women CIOs to be more modest—about 18 percent collectively. However, the numbers of women CIOs seemed to vary widely by industry vertical, with women representing as much as 25 percent in the financial sector, and 21 percent in the energy sector, for instance. And IT leaders can take solace from the fact that there are more women CIOs than CEOs, where women representation is still in the single digits, no matter what the market sector.\nThe same study noted that from 2018 to 2019, the percentage of women CIOs rose two percent from 16 to 18 percent. Progress, it seems, has been slow, but certain.\nGrowing gender diversity benefits the whole organization\nAs it turns out, there may be reasons for that beyond just a general drive for social justice and inclusion in the workplace. Companies are starting to discover that women in IT leadership may be more effective than their male counterparts. This analysis from Deloitte, for instance, cites several surveys and academic studies that show female tech leaders have scores in intelligence, innovation, ambition, honesty, and decisiveness that are on par with men’s. What’s more, these surveys show that women actually have a distinct advantage in the areas of empathy, emotional intelligence, team building and project organization.\nThose “soft skills” can pay big dividends for companies, creating more inclusive environments that attract a more diverse, empowered workforce. With female leaders who are more persuasive, assertive, and willing to take risks, teams model those behaviors—causing a system-wide improvement in results.\nIn fact, a recent analysis in the Harvard Business Review found that companies with at least 30 percent of its C-suite positions filled by women (posts which might include CEO, the board and other top leadership) had earned one percent more in net margin versus less diverse companies. What does that mean in dollars and cents? An additional 15 percent increase in profitability, in the average company.\nCorporate America takes note\nNot only are many organizations starting their own women’s networking groups, but some of the biggest companies are banding together to help lift women up the tech ranks. T200, a new organization, started in 2017 with just 10 members, has now grown to a group of 160 female tech leaders. It’s mission is to improve diversity of women in the tech business, with members including the CIOs, CDOs and/or CTOs of American Airlines, Alaska Airlines, Align Technology, Citrix, Zoetis and Clark Hill Law, along with Chandrasekaran, Chamarthi and Vaid, among others. This March, the organization announced it’s “LIFT Program,” which aims to help a group of hand-picked mentees navigate their way up the leadership ladder with continued professional development, leadership training and mentorship from other top female leaders.\nIt’s a program more organizations may be emulating in the future.

You can access your accounts online through our County website.\nResidential & Commercial\nProperty assessments reflect an estimate of the typical market value of your property developed solely for the purpose of determining your portion of the municipality's property tax.\nIt is important to remember that property assessment notices are mailed by the end of May or early June. Your property assessment is used to determine your property tax levy (assessed property value x tax rate = your property tax levy).\nImportant 2023 Dates\n|June 13 - August 12\n|60 day review period\n|Final date to file a complaint\n|Property tax payments due\n|6% penalty on current year tax\n|7% penalty on total outstanding balance\nMarket Value Assessments\nMarket value, as defined in the Municipal Government Act 1(n), means the amount that a property might be expected to realize if it is sold on the open market by a willing seller to a willing buyer. Market value assessments are done using mass appraisal techniques, which determine property values by grouping similar properties as of a specific date.\nThe purpose of assessment is not to reflect a single sale price, but to assess all properties at typical market value on the same valuation date, so that taxation is fairly and uniformly shared. The County of Wetaskiwin employs qualified accredited assessors who assess properties based on provincial legislation and regulations. Assessors can be contacted anytime to discuss your assessment.\nThe assessed value on your 2023 notice is based on July 1, 2022 economic conditions, and the physical condition and characteristics of the home as of December 31, 2022.\nTo determine if your assessment is reasonable, compare your 2023 assessed value to typical market conditions as of July 1, 2022, not to current market conditions. Assessors consider many of the same factors that a home owner does when they choose to purchase a home. Some of the factors that determine the value of your home include:\n- Basement finish\n- Lot size\n- Overall quality\n- Square footage\n- Year of construction\n- Style of house\nUnique location influences, like the views and river valleys, naturally lend themselves to an overall higher market value compared to other jurisdictions.", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

Sherman joined cornerback Brandon Browner, safety Earl Thomas and safety Kam Chancellor in what would become known as the Legion of Boom – the league’s best secondary. Baldwin emerged as a dynamic wideout threat in 2013, his third season in the league. Through Seattle’s playoff run, the Stanford alum caught 13 passes for 202 yards and a touchdown in the Super Bowl. While with his disruptive work up front, Bennett helped Seattle become the league’s top-ranked defense. As good as the trio was on the field, they did even more important work off the field, becoming known for being vocal about their beliefs as Black men. At the height of their popularity, the group chose to use their platform to speak on three young Black men who were killed at various points in 2014 – amplifying the stories of injustice happening daily.\nThe untimely deaths of Eric Garner (July), Michael Brown (August) and Tamir Rice (November) at the hands of police rocked the globe, inspiring voices to demand change. CBS sat down with the group about choosing to speak out about the tragic deaths despite the backlash that came with it. Bennett discussed the importance of taking the conversations from the locker room to the people, and using their voices as black men to help bring justice for the voiceless.\n“It’s a story that you’re compelled to tell,” said Bennett. “And amplify voices, because that experience can one day be us. It can be our child. Stepping into our voice, when you think about that platform – it changes when you win the Super Bowl. You see everybody starting to understand what they can do with their voice.”\nBennett recalls a team meeting as the deaths and viral instances of police brutality continued to go global via social media and news outlets.\n“That was the longest team meeting I’ve ever been a part of,” said Bennett. “We had to choose what we were going to do, and the conversation.

Dura fabrics are specifically designed to be stylish and durable, yet easily cared for and cleaned using water and a mild, water-based soap. As with most living room furniture fabrics, spills and stains will happen. Attend to any cleaning issues promptly to help keep the Dura fabrics looking neat and fresh.\nVacuum Dura suede-type fabrics -- DuraPella and Duraplush -- weekly using the upholstery attachment to remove surface soil, lint and pet hair. Routinely wipe down Durablend leather-blend fabric with a damp, soft cloth to remove the same.\nVideo of the Day\nBlot any spilled liquids, such as water, juice or soda, immediately with a soft cloth or paper towels. Press down firmly and hold the soft cloth or paper towel on top of the spill for a minute or so to allow the moisture from the spill to be absorbed. Repeat until no more moisture is absorbed.\nClean all spots and stains on Dura fabrics using a mild, low pH water-based soap. Dampen a clean, soft cloth or sponge with water and a small amount of water-based soap. Don't saturate the fabric with water. Blot the stain or spot repeatedly with a clean area of cloth until the entire soiled area is completely clean.\nUse a foam upholstery cleaner on Durapella or Duraplush fabrics as an alternative to water-based soap. Spray the foam lightly over the stain or spot and let it sit, following the manufacturer's directions as to how long to let the foam sit. Blot the stain away using a soft cloth or sponge until the stain has been removed.\nLet all Dura fabrics air dry after cleaning. Durapella and Duraplush suede-like fabrics may take a bit longer to dry than Durablend leather-blend fabric.\nBrush Durapella and Duraplush lightly with a soft-bristled microfiber or suede brush after cleaning to restore the fabric pile to its normal appearance. Durapella fabric doesn't require brushing after cleaning.\nKeep newspapers and magazines off any Dura fabrics. The printing ink can seep into the fabric and cause staining.\nFlip the pillow cushions and cushions on a regular basis to keep Dura fabrics looking clean and evenly worn.\nTo prevent rings from forming on the fabric, clean all spots and stains by working from the outside in toward the middle.\nClean all Dura fabrics on the piece of furniture itself. Don't remove cushion or pillow covers to launder in a washing machine as they can shrink or stretch out of shape.\nNever use strong detergents or cleaning solvents to clean Dura fabrics.\nProtect Dura fabrics from coming into contact with other cleaning products you use near the furniture. Harsh cleaning solvents and chemicals can damage Dura fabrics and cause them to fade.", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}

Take a short break and start trading the market with a fresh mindset.\nSaving yourself form the major reversal is really easy. You don’t have to learn rocket science to save yourself from the major trend reversal. Follow the tips of this article and you will see a dramatic improvement in your win rate.

Located just a stone's throw from the Eiffel Tower, this major art fair is not only a showcase for French and Parisian galleries but also those from Europe and further afield.\nGalleries present their leading artists and those who they have pinned their greatest hope on. Everything at the fair is up for sale and there’s a great diversity of choice - for all budgets.\n\"The fair has a number of high profile galleries, at the same time there are what I like to call author galleries, small and medium-sized galleries that have an original line. That’s essentially the DNA of Art Paris. Both the very well-known and discovery,” Art Paris' General Curator Guillaume Piens told Euronews.\nArt and the environment\nThe environment and ecology is the noticeable theme this year.

Universal and transversal themes that embrace very current issues according to Alice Audouin, curator of the exhibition \"Art and Environment\".\n\"It's a selection of 17 artists, many young artists. There is a real generational phenomenon today, it is true that many young artists address these environmental themes. They were born with the ecological crisis, for them, it's their time, so all those who address reality, who are sensitive and who work on the issues of their time, inevitably cross today's ecological issues, whether it's the climate, biodiversity, pollution.\"\nCameroonian painter Barthélemy Togo is among several artists in the fair’s 'Natural History' exhibit. His latest work produced during the pandemic features a series of prints of animals wearing face masks.\n\"I was born in Mbalmayo, which is in the middle of the Equatorial forest, and I know the importance of nature, the vitality of nature. I have always been in love and close to nature and it is important for me to include it in my artwork, and to celebrate it,\" Togo said.\nIn addition to the artists, many galleries have also embraced collections with ecology at their heart. Among them, Galleria Continua. It has a network of eight galleries across Europe, including its latest, recently inaugurated in Paris.\n\"We are opening this week an exhibition of Pascale Marthine Tayou, which we’ve brought here to Art Paris. We have brought three of her works because they really express the theme that the fair has chosen this year, that of art and the environment,\" said Galleria Continua's Salomé Zelic.\nArt Paris aims to capture the state of modern and contemporary art today all under one roof.\nThe fair runs until Sunday, April 10.", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

{"id": "5815", "text": "Don’t settle for a relationship that fills you with despair instead of happiness.\nSometimes, love is blind. Identifying a toxic relationship can be difficult when you’re the one that’s in the relationship. You may be receiving some opinions from your friends or family, but nobody truly knows how your partner treats you – or how you treat them – behind closed doors besides yourself. Recognizing if you’re in a toxic relationship or not, no matter whose fault it is, is an essential step for both of you to figure out the next stage of your relationship.Whether it be gaslighting, the lack of support, or the breaking of boundaries, this post has got you covered.\n1. They Gaslight You\nEmotional and psychological manipulation 101: getting you to question your own sanity and not believe in the things you thought happened. When you bring up something they said or did that didn’t sit right with you, they deny everything, claiming they never said or did any of those things. They also tend to say that you’re overreacting and always blow things out of proportion, yet they go on to do the exact things they criticize you for doing, simultaneously being hypocritical and never putting the blame on themselves.\n2. They Make You Feel Insecure and Unsafe\nYou feel like you can never be yourself around them because whenever you try to, they point out all your flaws and make you feel incredibly insecure. Rather than feeling safe and protected, they belittle you with demeaning comments and act hostile or threatening in order to intimidate you and instill the fear that you will disappoint or anger them by doing something wrong.\n3. They Don’t Support You\nWhen you accomplish something and feel proud of yourself, they often feel jealous and choose to put you down by not offering any support or praise. When you’re already down and upset, they make you feel even worse about it and not show any empathy instead of giving you a shoulder to lean on. They’re generally indifferent towards your achievements and don’t care when you’re hurt or defeated.\n4. There is No Trust\nThey lie and deceive you about many things. Because of that, you feel you can’t trust them with anything they say, as well as anything you say or reveal about yourself in fear of them telling someone else. They have betrayed your trust so many times that they simply aren’t reliable anymore.\n5. There Is an Imbalance of Power\nIf they are in charge of all your decision-making and have controlling behaviors toward you. They hold all the power in the relationship as you are co-dependent on them for almost everything. They make all the decisions for you, from what you should wear to something huge like your finances, or even who you can and can’t hang out with.\n6. There are No Boundaries\nThere are no established boundaries between either of you, but if there are, they break them anyway. They never want you to leave their side, giving you no personal space and smothering you. This only leaves room for more arguments to take place as you grow tired of each other.\n7. There is No Open Communication\nThere is no open communication between you two. Confrontation is not an option for them in certain types of conflict. They are not willing to talk about particular issues with you just to avoid an argument, preventing the relationship from growing, as well as stopping you guys from learning from each other.\n8. You Feel Drained\nYou feel emotionally and physically exhausted whenever you are with them, leaving you no time to focus on or take care of yourself. You devote all your time and energy to them while they don’t really do the same in return.\nIf you see some of these signs in your partner or you realize you’re the one inflicting the toxicity onto them, it may be time to reevaluate what’s best for both of you moving forward. Whether it be couples’ therapy, taking a break from the relationship, or breaking up with them completely, anything is better than remaining in a stagnant relationship that doesn’t make either of you happy.\nDisclaimer: The information provided here is for general informational purposes only.

{"id": "5868", "text": "When Obica launched its first UK endeavour, it unsurprisingly turned heads. As an established and highly celebrated eatery in its native land since 2004, here it found itself in a somewhat saturated market of passionless pizza and pasta dishes, masquerading as Mediterranean delicacies.\nLaying out the groundwork as the UK’s first mozzarella bar, Obica found distinction through putting its rich experience and deep knowledge to work – producing a meticulously designed menu centred wholly on the fresh hand-made cheese from premium buffalo milk it is now infamous for.\nObica St Pauls is difficult to ignore. Located just a few blocks away from the impressive Cathedral itself, it doesn’t impose an abrasive façade, or overflow onto the street with culinary theatrics. Instead, it subtly radiates a comforting welcome through its floor-to-ceiling windows with buzzing patrons behind, beckoning you into the stylishly sleek modern eatery full of flavour and soul.\nThis encapsulates the essence of Obica. It leverages simplicity, whether in its design, its menu, or even its operation, to elevate the unique qualities it proudly brings to the table. While the food sections read as one would expect, with an array of small plates, tasting boards, salad, pizzas, pastas and the likes, there’s twists and turns in flavours too, with raspberry dressings topping pizzas and burrata featuring in burgers. This is a menu for the lovers of familiar favourites, and the adventurous diners alike.\nEven the most basic of its offerings are packed with focussed quality. The pizza dough, for instance, is prepared with Molino Paolo Mariani flour and sourdough, and undergoes a 48-hour slow-rising process to make the pizzas fragrant and highly digestible. The fresh pasta, made in Campania with the most precious varieties of Italian durum wheat, is handmade by local producers, bronze-drawn, and dried with the traditional Cirillo method.\nThe authenticity can’t be overstated. All the ingredients go through a meticulous preselecting process, with the emphasis on high-quality Italian producers and a quick shipping. The freshness factor is absolutely vital – the renowned mozzarella reaches the restaurants the morning after the producer has created it, and lands on the plates within that same 24 hour period. And the taste is unmistakable.\nA menu highlight is undeniably the Burrata and Saffron pizza, which incorporates the flavours of the luxuriously creamy Buffalo Mozzarella with Buffalo Ricotta, Basil Parmigiano Reggiano Chips, and Black Pepper. It marries perfectly with the texture of the Obica dough to create a decadent experience to please all palettes.\nFreshly prepared, the dessert menu merges traditional and contemporary recipes of creams and cakes for a genuine taste of the Italian sugary appetite. The decadently creamy Tiramisu is unmissable if you have a sweet tooth, with the Obica Affogato as a flawless final touch for the meal.\nThe key to the success of the menu is the personal touch. There’s an intimacy in the knowledge held by the chefs and creators that can only be explained by passion. There’s no ‘head office’, or corporate management. The Obica teams work directly from the restaurants, focussing on experience deliverables rather than logistical bureaucracy. There’s personal investment, too. The recipes are identical across all the branches internationally, and the chefs regularly travel cross-continent to teach the best techniques and absorb inspiration from their fellow masterminds.\nYou won’t find a lengthy branch list on Obica’s location page any time soon. The restaurant is less interested in expansion than in refining and developing its existing sites – though there is an exciting upcoming rebranding that is likely to bring with it a new selection of treats and surprises for Obica fans to indulge in.\nObica has deservedly established itself as the genuine Italian dining experience in London. It has emulated the roaring success it has seen in its native Italy, offering authenticity and soul to Mediterranean dining in the Capital – and indeed, beyond. And with the rebranding around the corner, the future looks brighter than ever for it.\nYou can immerse yourself in the Obica experience at your nearest mozzarella bar here.\nLiked this post?

{"id": "5878", "text": "Published on June 29, 2017\nWhat is a preterm birth?\nPreterm birth is defined as a birth before 37 weeks gestation. One of the reasons GrassrootsHealth has created a field trial around pregnancy and preterm birth is very specific – there is a defined time frame and babies either are or are not preterm.\nWhat is the harm of a preterm birth?\nTo start, preterm birth is cited as the reason for 28% of newborn deaths (first month of life).\nSecondly, full-term babies stay in utero for 40 weeks in order to complete development. The earlier a baby is born, the more likely they are to have health problems. Some of these problems don’t show up right away, they may not appear until age 3, or even adulthood.\nLonger-term problems include ADHD, cerebral palsy, autism, asthma, intestinal problems, pneumonia, vision problems, hearing loss, and dental problems.\nIs this an important problem for the US?\nYes! As of 2015, the US had a preterm birth rate of 9.6%, roughly 1 in 10 babies were born prematurely, about 380,000 babies in the US each year. The US, while one of the most advanced countries in the world, ranked #130 in preterm births out of 184 countries in 2010.\nThe March of Dimes has seen a steady decline in preterm births since its height in 2006, at 12.8%, but if you go back in time – in 1980 it was 9.4%.\nWhat are the healthcare costs of a preterm baby?\nThe March of Dimes estimates that a preterm birth costs $50,000 more than a full-term birth for the first year of life ($5,085 for a healthy, full-term baby and $55,393 for a premature or low birth weight baby).\nConsidering a larger scale, the March of Dimes estimates that businesses are billed over $12 billion annually in excess health care costs due to preterm birth within their employee base.\nWhat is March of Dimes doing around preterm birth?\nThe March of Dimes was founded in 1938 by Franklin Delano Roosevelt with the mission of curing polio. By 1958 the polio vaccine was in full swing, they needed a new mission so they turned to babies. Initially, their mission was to prevent birth defects and infant mortality. In 2003 they focused their efforts on prematurity – the single biggest health risk for infants today. Solving preterm birth would have the biggest impact on infant mortality.\nDoes that give you an idea of the severity of the problem?\nWhy is this important to GrassrootsHealth?\nTogether with researchers at the Medical University of South Carolina, we have found a way to significantly decrease the rate of preterm birth with a cost-effective, reproducible program called Protect Our Children NOW! Indeed, it protects our children by giving them the start to life they need – the healthiest pregnancy and longest time in utero. We are working with hospitals, institutions, individuals, and public health officials to move this out into standard practice – the time is NOW!\nWant more information?\nRead about this program at the Medical University of South Carolina.\nRead the paper associated with the first 15 months of this program.\nRead the many videos, papers, and charts about pregnancy and vitamin D.", "scores": {"score": 4, "score_transform_1": 5, "score_transform_2": 5, "score_transform_3": 0}}

Estimates vary widely from 20 billion euros ($27 billion) to over three times that amount.\n“Serious rifts remain, especially on the financial settlement,” Barnier said.\n“We will not pay at 27 what has been decided at 28, it is simple as that.”\nEU parliamentarians were set to approve a resolution later Tuesday that will call for a postponement of any move to widen the talks with Britain, unless “a major breakthrough” takes place during the fifth round of negotiations in Brussels next month.\nObservers said decisive progress was highly unlikely. The moves further dampened hopes that the EU leaders would give the green light to an expansion in the talks at a summit on Oct 19-20.\nMany lawmakers were also dismissive of the Britain’s Conservative government, which is widely seen as insecure and bumbling.\nThe head of the biggest party group in the European Parliament called for the sacking of British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson for stoking confusion over the Brexit talks.\nEuropean People’s Party chairman Manfred Weber appealed to Prime Minister Theresa May: “Please sack Johnson, because we need a clear answer who is responsible for the British position.”\nWeber turned Henry Kissinger’s observation about the many leaders in the EU onto Britain, asking who he should call to know the real U.K. position on Brexit.\nHe said: “Who shall I call in London, who speaks for the government?

Without regular in-person social interaction, we don’t know with much certainty who in our community is “managing” or “doing okay” and who is not. While this social isolation is hard on all of us, it can be disastrous for survivors of domestic abuse.\nThe Silence of Social Distancing\nEven before the pandemic, some survivors would disappear into their homes, having limited contact with friends and acquaintances. Others found ways to move through the world holding a terrible secret while managing children, work, and a host of other obligations and commitments.\nOur current reality, however, has intensified the profound silence surrounding many abuse survivors and created situations that are becoming increasingly difficult and – in some cases – dangerous. Moreover, essential social distancing measures have disrupted some of the few supports that abuse survivors might have had and interfered with even those casual opportunities to connect in an office break room, a busy neighborhood playground, or a post-worship social gathering.\nReaching Out and Maintaining Connections\nSukkot challenges us to think about how we can be welcoming during a pandemic and – by extension – how to maintain connections when we cannot gather. We know that it is common for abuse survivors to constantly hear from a current or ex-partner that they are worthless and their lives don’t matter at all. Creating opportunities for people to connect – and also find help – is a step toward counteracting those devastating messages and affirming that every individual is seen and valued by those around them.\nWith this in mind, we hope that you will consider ways to increase social contact in your community and spread the word that help is available for survivors of abuse. Here are a few ideas:\n- Reach out to people beyond your close circle of friends to say hello and see how they are doing.\n- Look for ways to replace social interaction that normally happens at work, in your congregation/organization, or other spaces with an online gathering from time to time.\n- Join your congregation – or any group you are part of – in efforts to call members periodically to see how everyone is doing. If that isn’t happening, look into initiating an effort.\n- Use social media to share messages from domestic abuse prevention organizations like JF&CS Journey to Safety, Jane Doe Inc., and the National Domestic Violence Hotline.\n- Look for places (websites, chat boxes in online gatherings, your email signature, etc.) to post helpline information for people who have a controlling or abusive partner or former partner.\nWe hope that you will join us in finding ways to open our community tent flaps wider and perhaps even leave a lasting impression on someone passing through our lives, even if they are not a close connection. Working to make people – especially isolated survivors of abuse – feel seen and valued is at the heart of the kind of hospitality that Sukkot reminds us to embrace. This message feels more important now than ever before.\nJF&CS Journey to Safety focuses our outreach and awareness-raising efforts on the Jewish and Russian-speaking communities AND welcomes survivors from all backgrounds who are seeking support and assistance. For help, please call 781-647-5327 and ask for Journey to Safety or email firstname.lastname@example.org.", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}
{"id": "5980", "text": "Hi, In this post you will get to know 7 National Parks in Assam with google map locations and facts about them.\nAssam is one of the seven sisters of India, located in the north-eastern part of the country. Assam is one of the country's most charming regions, with diversified flora and fauna. Assam is a densely forested state made up of the Eastern Hills of the Northern Himalayas, the Deccan Plateau, and the Brahmaputra Plains. Assam is home to a plethora of uncommon species that seek refuge in the lush greenery of the natural world. Assam boasts diverse biodiversity that attracts many wildlife enthusiasts. However, in this post, we are going to learn some awesome facts about seven National parks in Assam with photo.\nASSAM HAS SEVEN NATIONAL PARKS – (2022)\n- Kaziranga National Park\n- Manas National Park\n- Nameri National Park\n- Rajiv Gandhi – Orang National Park\n- Dibru-Saikhowa National Park\n- Raimona National Park\n- Dihing Patkai national park\n7 National Parks in Assam You Can Visit In 2022\n1. Kaziranga National Park\nKaziranga National Park is home to one-horned rhinoceroses and is one of India's most diversified national parks. The forest terrain, which is bisected by four major rivers, has diverse sections with different features and hence houses some of the rarest flora and fauna species. Apart from rhinos, Asian Elephants also make their home in Kaziranga National Park's grasslands. Tigers, jackals, wild boars, barasingha (swamp deer), leopard cats, monitor lizards, and a variety of other animals live in the park. The abundant birdlife of Kaziranga is also well-known. The area is home to a variety of birds, including the Fishing Eagle, Oriental Honey Buzzard, Himalayan Griffon, and White-tailed Eagle. Elephant safaris, as well as boat and jeep safaris, are provided at the national park's tipping points.\n2. Manas National Park\nManas National Park is located in Assam's north-eastern corner, sharing a border with Bhutan. The park, which covers a huge area, is home to a diverse range of vegetation and fauna. With its typical tropical monsoon rainfall climate, the national park is home to more than twenty-five endangered species from throughout the world. While wild water buffaloes can easily be seen here, other creatures like as the Assam Roofed Turtle, Golden Langoor, and Hispid Hare, as well as the rare Pygmy Hog, can also be seen. Because of the unique biodiversity found in this area, Manas National Park has been designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. This conservation is a picturesque treasure, with forested Himalayan slopes and changeable river Manas channels.\n3. Dibru-Saikhowa National Park\nThe Dibru Saikhowa National Park is a wetlands area in Assam's Tinsukia district. This national park, which covers an area of around 340 square kilometers, is home to a variety of uncommon animals. The park is home to over 500 kinds of birds, both migratory and local, thanks to the sections of wetlands scattered throughout the park. This park is home to endangered species such as the white-winged duck, marsh babbler, and white-rumped vulture. Wild water buffalo, Hoolock gibbons, tigers, and elephants are among the animals that can be seen here. The constant sightings of Gangetic River Dolphins while on a boat safari are what draw visitors to this National Park.\n4. Nameri National Park\nNameri National Park, which shares a border with Arunachal Pradesh and so merges with the Pakhui Wildlife Sanctuary, covers an area of about 200 square kilometers. This park, located in the Eastern Himalayan foothills, is a birdwatcher's paradise. The park also serves as an elephant sanctuary. It is home to animals such as the tiger, Himalayan Black Bear, Wild Boar, and Indian Giant Squirrel. Ibis bill, Wreathed hornbill, black stork, and Rufous-necked hornbill are among the birds that call this place home. The National Park also has orchids, which contribute to its diverse flora.\n5. Rajiv Gandhi – Orang National Park\nOrang National Park, which runs along the northern bank of the Brahmaputra River, is home to a large population of one-horned rhinos. The park is quite small in size, covering roughly 78 square kilometers. The park's distinctiveness comes from the fact that it is home to more than 50 different fish species, as well as a diverse fauna. Otters, hog deer, Indian civet, Rhesus macaque, Bengal Porcupine, Indian pangolin, and Indian fox are among the animals that call this place home. Birds such as kingfishers, pintails, and woodpeckers are frequently seen. The park has a picturesque attractiveness as it scales the landforms and water.\n6. Raimona National Park\nRaimona National Park is home to the Golden Langur, an endemic species, Clouded leopards, wild buffalo, spotted deer, over 150 types of butterflies, 170 species of birds, including the white-bellied heron, and approximately 380 plant species are just a few of the animals and plants that may be found here.", "scores": {"score": 3, "score_transform_1": 5, "score_transform_2": 5, "score_transform_3": 0}}
{"id": "5986", "text": "Worried about parabens? Several of you have been sending us images of the back labels on your beauty and personal care products on our whatsapp helpline (+918437048180) asking us to check if the products you use, are made from ingredients are free from parabens or not also safe for you and your family?\nOne of the most commonly occurring controversial ingredient that we’ve come across in suinteractions with you are ‘parabens’- commonly used preservatives in beauty products. There’s been a lot of talk lately about parabens but there isn’t much information about this controversial ingredient in a form that a regular consumer can understand. So we decided to cut-out the jargon and explain the basics in plain English.\nWhat are parabens?\nA group of synthetic compounds commonly used as preservatives in a wide range of health, beauty and personal care products. They’re added to products to increase their shelf life and to prevent them from getting spoilt.\nThey’re added to deodorants, toothpastes, shampoos, conditioners, body lotions and makeup, among other products, to stop the growth of fungus, bacteria and other potentially damaging microbes.\nAre they harmful?\nSome say yes and some say no. But there sure is a controversy around their usage. “Of greatest concern is that parabens are known to disrupt hormone function, an effect that is linked to increased risk of breast cancer and reproductive toxicity,” reports the non-profit Campaign for Safe Cosmetics (CSC). “Parabens mimic estrogen by binding to estrogen receptors on cells.” Research has shown that the perceived influx of estrogen beyond normal levels can in some cases trigger reactions such as increasing breast cell division and the growth of tumors.\nHow do I know if my personal care products have these?\nRead the label. If the brand lists ingredients in full (they should but several companies get away without disclosing the full ingredient list), these will appear as methylparaben, ethylparaben, propylparaben, butylparaben and isobutylparaben. If you see any of these on the label, the product contains parabens.\nDoes Just Herbs use parabens ?\n\"No we do not use parabens. While we don’t support or oppose the use of parabens but as a brand that stands for safe skincare, we’ve eliminated this controversial ingredient from all our formulations.\nWe use preservatives approved by ECOCERT (the French organic certification agency) and our proprietary blend of essential oils and herbs to preserve our products. This ensures product stability without compromising safety.\nHow can I know more?\nShould you have questions still, whatsapp us on +918437048180", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}

{"id": "6000", "text": "Checking gojek receipts specifically for Gosend services is very easy. With this convenience, a sender will not be difficult when he wants to know where the goods have reached. This convenience is certainly not only felt by the sender. The recipient can also feel the convenience. Gosend itself is one of the features of gojek.\nThis is a form of development of the development that gojek continues to make. This company is now very big. His own age has been long enough. The first time gojek was established was in 2010. Initially, this company only provided transportation services in the form of motorcycle taxis or cars.\nBut the more here, the services needed by Indonesians are more and more. The many needs of these services make development carried out until the discovery of Gosend. But when using it, there are many users who do not know how to check gojek receipts specifically for Gosend services. This is certainly difficult.\nHow to Check Gojek’s Own Receipt\nGosend is a feature of sending goods from gojek that makes the sender do not need to go directly to the recipient.

When tracking using the application, you will not know the latest location of the goods through writing. But in the application, the latest location of the goods will be displayed through the folder. It has its advantages.\nWhen a location is displayed in the form of an address, some people often don’t know the address. This makes the user need to find the address first. when the latest location is given in the form of a map, the user will immediately imagine where the location is. Check gojek receipts specifically gosend services can also be done via call center.\nTo do so, customers can contact the gojek call center first. from the call center, explain the request to find out the latest location. Later, CS will give some questions as validity. If the question is successfully answered, CS will notify the latest location of the package sent.\nThe last way to check gojek receipts specifically for Gosend services is to use the online shop application. Of course, this can be done only if the customer buys products from the online shop. Using an online shopping application is also quite easy because the receipts from such shipments do not need to be seen.\nTypes of Shipping When Using Gosend\nWhen going to use Gosend, please note that there are two types of shipments that can be used. To choose it, customers need to know the difference between the two types of shipments first. The difference itself is quite a lot. Customers can see the difference in terms of price and time.\nFor the first type of delivery itself is called Gosend Instant Delivery. This is the type of gojek delivery with the highest popularity. Gosend service special gosend receipt checks are also mostly used for this type. When choosing this type, delivery of goods cannot be done for a distance of more than 40 km.\nFrom that distance, the maximum travel time of the driver will be about 120 minutes. However, this service is only crowded in major cities. Noted, Jabodetabek and Bandung are the cities with the most use of this service. There is a maximum weight of the package when using it. The maximum weight itself is 20 kg.\nIn addition, the maximum dimensions also need to be considered. The maximum dimension of the goods for this shipment is 50 X 70 X 50. The price itself is quite cheap. The cost per KM is only 2,500 rupiah. However, there is a minimum of shipping costs. Users cannot use instant delivery at a cost below 20 thousand rupiah.\nThe second type is called Gosend Same day. Check gojek receipts specifically gosend same day service is not as much as instant delivery. That’s because, this service is only used for long-distance delivery. The travel time is also further. Drivers can deliver same-day packages for up to 8 hours.\nThis makes intercity delivery faster. However, there are minimum rates that need to be issued. Same day can only be used if the rate is above 150 thousand rupiah. If calculated, the cost is very easy. For 30 km, the sender only needs to spend as much as 150 thousand rupiah.\nAdvantages When Using Gosend in Shipping\nWhen the gojek receipt check for gosend service is smooth, the advantages of this feature will be felt. The first advantage lies in speed. If the user uses an expedition service, the fastest package delivery is 1 day. It can also only be done for places close by.\nWhen using Gosend, the maximum time is only 8 hours. This is very profitable and helps if the delivery of goods is being done in a hurry. Practicality will also be seen when using this feature. This practicality is very pronounced because the sender does not need to go to the service location.\nBefore you can check gojek receipts specifically gosend service, drivers will pick up the package to the front of the house. This makes other activities not disturbed but the delivery of goods can still be done. Another advantage that is often not realized lies in frugality. Some people often complain about the cost of sending gojek which he thinks is high.\nIn fact, this statement is not true. When sending using gojek, the driver will deliver the package using a motorcycle. The fuel released is certainly not as expensive as a car. This makes the rates much cheaper. Different things will obviously be felt when using other expeditions.\nMost of these expeditions carry out shipments of goods by car. Because the use of cars requires a large amount of gasoline, the shipping costs are certainly very high. Another advantage of using Gosend lies in the safety of goods. When using it, the package is guaranteed to be safe until it reaches its destination.\nThat’s because, the assigned drivers have passed training and selection. With that, the driver can be sure to be trusted. In addition, the name to the driver’s contact is also clearly displayed. This allows customers to know the driver who made the delivery. Even if there is damage, gojek provides insurance for each shipment.\nGojek Has Many Helpful Features\nFew people know the new features of gojek. Though in addition to Gosend, there are still many features that are very useful. One of the most important features is called goauto. This is a feature of automotive services online. If your vehicle is damaged, this service makes you do not need to go out of the house to fix it.\nIn addition, the goauto service also provides a car wash feature. This makes the washer from goauto will come to the consumer’s house. There is also a feature called gomassage. This is the call feature of the masseur. With this feature, you who are aching can bring the best masseurs to the house.\nGojek is a company that continues to grow. Although the name is already very big, changes will definitely continue to occur in the years ahead. But in addition to its main function as an online motorcycle taxi, gosend service is definitely one of the most popular. You as a user must be very comfortable with the service and how to check gojek receipts specifically gosend service that is easy.", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

Jordan Henderson swarmed over Mesut Ozil and won possession, but then lifted the ball over Cech and off target after being played in by Firmino.\nMane volleyed Georginio Wijnaldum’s knockdown around the half-hour mark, but made no mistake when rounding off a devastating Liverpool counter five minutes before the break.\nA lightning-quick transition from defence to attack - which saw Wijnaldum, Can and Firmino work the ball up the pitch to Mane - ended with the Senegalese cutting inside Rob Holding and curling a low, right-footed effort beyond Cech for his third Premier League goal in as many games this season.\nThere was to be no let up after the interval, and it was the willingness of Klopp’s front three to press high that resulted in Liverpool’s third goal in the 57th minute.\nSalah pounced on a loose touch from Hector Bellerin - who was left alone at the back as Arsenal took a corner - just inside the Reds’ half, surged away towards the Kop and coolly slotted past Cech from 12 yards.\nMane was within a yard of making it four when he slid an effort past Cech, but the Gunners cleared off the line.\nThat was the No.19’s final contribution before being withdrawn, to a fully deserved standing ovation, for Sturridge.\nSturridge made an immediate impact, too, as he nodded Salah’s cross in from close range following yet another brilliant team move from Liverpool, who have now won four consecutive matches in all competitions.", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

They can be introduced into meat and poultry at any point, starting from when the animal is alive to when it is being served for dinner, any time from farm to table.\nFortunately, established food-safety procedures have made the US animal protein supply chain one of the safest in the world. Still, occasionally, there’s a mishap, and no processor wants to be that occasion.\nThe most recent data from Atlanta-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) indicate that each year, roughly one in six Americans (or 48 million people) get sick from a foodborne illness – an array of illnesses caused by consuming foods (not just animal protein) contaminated with certain microorganisms. Though most are minor afflictions, CDC statistics show that these cause as many as 128,000 Americans to be hospitalized annually and about 3,000 to die each year.\nBut here’s the good news: these figures are down significantly from a decade ago. Still, continuous efforts are needed to effectively prevent pathogenic contamination and growth.\nBecause the US meat and poultry industries produce such high-quality products, this may contribute to an increased food-safety risk. For example, years ago, it was easy to tell if a piece of meat had gone bad, as it became organoleptically undesirable due to the growth of spoilage microorganisms or lipid oxidation.\nToday, to expand distribution, processors often incorporate ingredient and processing technologies to lower or virtually eliminate spoilage microorganisms from foods, extending product shelf-life so that it can travel longer distances and reach more customers. Without these inherent indicators suggesting that it is time to discard, pathogenic bacteria have more time to grow to numbers that can cause illness and sometimes lead to death.\nSome pathogens were not previously known (new pathogens), others have newly arisen as foodborne (emerging pathogens) and others have become more potent or associated with other products (evolving pathogens), according to a paper entitled “Emerging Bacterial Pathogens in Meat and Poultry: An Overview,” published in Food and Bioprocess Technology (February 2010). The fact is that meat and poultry are susceptible to contamination by pathogens, with many foodborne diseases associated with consumption of meat and poultry.\nFor example, Campylobacter jejuni is most notably associated with undercooked poultry. Specifically, the paper notes that C. jejuni O:19 and other serotypes are common etiological agents of Guillain–Barré syndrome, a neuropathy due to autoimmune response. Ingestion of Salmonella bacterium, which is also associated with undercooked poultry, leads to salmonellosis. This can lead to gastrointestinal distress and fever. Escherichia coli have been associated with consumption of undercooked, contaminated ground beef. The key here is that if it is present in the protein, proper cooking should kill it.\nThat’s not an option with Listeria monocytogenes, a ubiquitous pathogen that is a major public health concern because of its severity. L. monocytogenes is found throughout the environment and in many foods, primarily animal-based products. It resists historical microbial growth inhibitors, such as salt and acidity, and readily grows at refrigerated temperatures. And though freezing temperatures will stop its growth, this hearty bacterium remains viable.\nProper cooking and reheating of foods effectively controls Listeria; however, refrigerated foods such as ready-to-eat (RTE) meat and poultry products, especially products purchased through the deli or in a hand-prepared sandwich, are very susceptible to contamination. This is because these products are repeatedly exposed to microorganisms in the environment and do not require further cooking prior to consumption.\nOn Dec. 9, 2002, the US Dept. of Agriculture Food Safety and Inspection Service (USDA-FSIS) put into effect directive 10,240.3, which instructs inspection-program personnel on when and how often to inspect RTE meat and poultry products, such as deli-type meats and poultry that are sliced in the establishment or at retail, and hot dog-type products. The directive identifies antimicrobial agents formulated with sodium/potassium lactate and sodium diacetate as a means to have the RTE products classified as “low risk.” Establishments that produce low-risk products may be eligible for FSIS’s low-targeted verification testing program, meaning decreased frequency of product, food-contact surface and plant-environment testing. This translates to reduced testing expenses for processors.\nFurther, to help prevent outbreaks of L. monocytogenes foodborne infection, also known as listeriosis, on Oct. 6, 2003, USDA-FSIS implemented a rule (9 CFR 430) requiring manufacturers to take precautionary steps to better control product adulteration from L. monocytogenes. The rule allows manufacturers to use approved antimicrobials.\nRecognizing the need for antimicrobial options beyond lactates and diacetates, in 2005 the American Meat Institute Foundation commissioned researchers at the Univ. of Wisconsin-Madison to evaluate antimicrobials that are Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) for a variety of food products other than meat and poultry. In the researchers’ final report published in June 2006, the scientists provided data showing that propionate, benzoate and sorbate can enhance the safety of high-moisture, RTE cured and uncured meat and poultry products and that addition of these antimicrobials has little negative impact on consumer taste preference. A number of suppliers of these ingredients are currently pursuing their use in RTE meat and poultry.\nPlay it safe\nTo best prevent foodborne pathogens from proliferating on meat and poultry, processors want to start with high-quality raw materials from healthy animals. Include hygienic slaughtering and butchering to avoid contamination of freshly exposed meat surfaces. Thoroughly cook products and ensure they are packaged and stored under proper temperature. Because cooked meats served cold are susceptible to contamination by L. monocytogenes, a proven antimicrobial should be included. In addition to the aforementioned ingredients, there are others that are recognized for their ability to retard spoilage microorganisms and have been shown to function effectively against pathogens.\nDonna Berry is a contributing editor from Chicago and is the owner of Dairy & Food Communications.\n|Enhance your industry IQ\nSign up for our free newsletters to stay informed on each day’s news and trends", "scores": {"score": 4, "score_transform_1": 5, "score_transform_2": 5, "score_transform_3": 0}}

The eldest daughter of James Monroe Hays and Naomi Geraldine Swift, she was born in Salt Lake City, Utah, September 30th, 1931. She married Robert Afton Bosen in the Salt Lake Temple on June 14, 1950. Together they had four sons and a daughter. A member of the LDS Church, she faithfully served in many callings. A brilliant scholar, poet, and artist, she graduated in 1949 as the valedictorian of her high school class. As her own children progressed through schools in Magna and while working as the secretary at Webster elementary school, she graduated from Brigham Young University with bachelor’s and Master's degrees. She loved teaching youngsters in church callings and in elementary schools. As a school librarian, she loved to read to the children and she sought out those that needed extra help with their reading.\nA prolific painter, her oil paintings adorn homes of many descendants and local businesses. Some of her poems were widely published in church magazines, and many more are preserved in private volumes cherished by her posterity.\nDee was legendary in her own community for her capacity for love and selfless service. Her eternal marriage blossomed with deep, constant expressions of joy and affection. Passionate hugs and kisses were regular and frequent, but never routine! All of their children knew they were born into a family of extraordinary love.\nProbably the greatest trial of her life was the long-term care and passing of her first husband and eternal companion Robert A. Bosen after a long decline spanning from 1973 through 2005. For every day of those 32 years, Dee invested her strength into his happiness. She made sure that he had all of the joy his declining body could handle. She literally kept him going, and when he became too fragile to be described as truly \"going\" she sustained him with her affection. We will never know the extent of her resulting exhaustion, but the extraordinary depth of her love surpassed the limits of ordinary endurance.\nAfter two years of being a widow, she married Marian Glenn Goodrich (1932-2016), also a faithful latter-day saint member of the Church of Jesus Christ, whose own eternal companion Margie Lee Trout had also passed away.

As Glenn aged and weakened into long illness, Dee once again invested her strength into his care and sustenance until he passed away in 2016.\nShe is survived by 5 children: Bob (Susan), Tomball, TX; Steve (Marilyn), West Jordan, UT; Bill (Jeannie), Pollock, Pines, CA; Tammy Tyler (Joe), Tooele UT; and Mike, Grantsville, UT; 20 grandchildren; 35 great-grandchildren; one great-great-grandchild; two brothers, (David and Wayne); and one sister (Marilyn).

In the former year he topped the end-of-year-rankings, but in the latter he used the victories as a warm-up for his first crack at the Nationwide (now Korn Ferry) Tour.\nMoreover, he maintained the momentum, landing victories in the Boise Open and Miccosukee Championship to finish fourth leading money winner and earn graduation to the PGA Tour at the first time of asking.\nImmediately at home\nIn finishing tied ninth at the 2012 AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am, Kokrak recorded his first top 10 on the main tour and also hinted at the strength that would make him a consistent performer at that level - he led the Greens in Regulation rankings that week.\nLate that year he finished second in the Frys.com Open to secure his card for 2013 and he has never struggled to repeat that feat ever since.\nHe added another runner-up finish at the 2016 Northern Trust Open - holding the first 36-hole lead of his PGA Tour career in the process - and a third in 2019 at the Valspar Championship.\nHe posted 28 top 10s on the PGA Tour from his debut in 2012 to the end of the 2019-20 season, went 11 months without missing a cut from June 2018, and he played in every FedExCup Playoff series from 2013 onward.\nHe was undeniably at home at the highest level, but the wins that had come at the second and third tiers were proving difficult to find on the PGA Tour.\nIronically, perhaps, when he finally did lift a trophy he did so after tussling with a high class field at The CJ Cup in late 2020.\nHe got off to a quiet start in Las Vegas, but ended the second and third rounds in the top five and a final round 64 saw him pass Russell Henley and Xander Schauffele.\nHe revealed that he had a secret weapon that week in that he had played the Shadow Creek course over 20 times before.\n\"I know the greens pretty well,\" he said. \"I know the little intricacies of this place. Not like some of the local caddies, but it is definitely a place that I feel comfortable at.\"\nThe win came in his 233rd start on the PGA Tour.\nGolfers often talk of enjoying the first win, but immediately desiring a second to prove it was no fluke. It's also often the case that corroboration can prove as difficult as breakthrough.\nNot for Dufner, however.\nIn early 2021 he laced together three consecutive top 10s at the prestigious WGC Workday Championship, Arnold Palmer Invitational and THE PLAYERS Championship.\nIn early summer he headed to Colonial Country Club, scene of one of his many near-misses just 12 months earlier, and proved he was a new golfer by challenging all week and then pouncing for the victory on Sunday.\nLate in the year he landed a third win in just 29 starts when weekends rounds of 66-65 saw him pass no less than 24 players in the final 36 holes.\nIncredibly his weekend had actually started with an appalling conclusion to his second round: he'd had seven holes left to play early on Saturday morning and had contrived to drop seven shots on them before rebounding in sensational style.\nIn December of 2021 he also added QBE Shootout victory alongside Kevin Na. It is an unofficial tournament on the PGA Tour schedule, but the manner of the win reiterated that he is a golfer growing used to winning.\nElite level results\nIt took nine starts before he ended a Major Championship inside the top 30 - and even then he could only finish T19th at the 2018 PGA Championship.\nAt the end of 2021 he had played another nine Majors and had improved his best to just T17th in the 2020 US Open.\nTo the same date he'd registered two top 10s in seven starts in World Golf Championship tournaments.\nJason Kokrak's personal life\nHe is married to Stephanie Mrofchak and they have children called Declan and Landon John.\nThe family live in Cleveland, Ohio.

A study of procedure management, user perceptions and compliance behaviour\nKanse L., Parkes K., Hodkiewicz M., Hu X., Griffin M.\n© 2017 Elsevier Ltd Adherence to procedures is critical to the safety and performance of maintenance tasks; however, few studies of procedure compliance among maintenance personnel have been reported. The present study evaluated a theoretical model in which management approaches to procedure compliance were linked to compliance outcomes through user perceptions of positive and negative procedure attributes. New scales were developed to assess these variables; hypotheses derived from the model were tested in survey data collected from maintainers in the mining industry (N = 176). A structural equation model showed acceptable fit statistics; findings were broadly consistent with the initial hypotheses. As predicted, positive and negative dimensions of procedure attributes and compliance/non-compliance were perceived as distinct constructs, and were implicated in different pathways of the model. Also supporting the initial hypotheses, user involvement and managers’ learning-oriented responses to non-compliance were linked to favourable compliance outcomes through perceived procedure attributes. Learning-oriented responses were also directly associated with greater compliance. In addition, and contrary to prediction, punitive management responses positively predicted compliance.

The program, which usually lasts 26 weeks, utilizes a full meal replacement plan that transitions to self-prepared ‘everyday’ meals, in conjunction with comprehensive patient education and support.\nThe program includes medical supervision, counseling, personalized support, and of course various Optifast meal replacement shakes.\nOptifast’s parent company, the infamous candy bar maker Nestle, commissioned a study that found using the Optifast Program before weight loss surgery can help patients lose enough weight to significantly reduce health risks associated with various procedures.\nI could’ve saved the Nestle team several million dollars by sharing this well-known fact in nutrition science:\nAny program that creates a calorie deficit and offers medical supervision and support is going to result in weight loss.\nSo if weight loss is your key goal (not necessarily fat loss), and you don’t care about the ingredients and sugar content in the products you buy, then Optifast may work just fine for you.\nIf you want to lose fat … or if you’re looking for a nutritious, all-natural protein powder / meal replacement, then Optifast is not your best bet.\nIn my Optifast reviews, I’ll analyze all their meal replacement shakes and protein powders by looking at two objective pieces of information:\n- The Ingredients\n- The Nutrition Facts Label\nLet’s dig in …\nOptifast sells 5 types of protein powders and meal replacement shakes:\n- Optifast 800 Ready to Drink\n- Optifast 800 Shake Mix\n- Optifast HP Shake Mix\n- Optisource Very High Protein Drink\n- BeneProtein Instant Protein Powder\nLet’s look at the nutrition facts information labels and ingredients for each …\nOptifast HP Shake Mix\nOptisource Very High Protein Drink\nBeneProtein Instant Protein Powder\nSummary of Optifast Shakes Nutrition Facts and Ingredients\n|Optifast 800 Ready to Drink\n|Optifast 800 Shake Mix\n|Optifast HP Shake Mix\n|Optisource Very High Protein Drink\n|BeneProtein Instant Protein Powder\n|Grams of Protein\n|Milk protein concentrate, soy protein isolate\n|Milk protein concentrate, soy protein isolate\n|Whey protein concentrate\nMilk protein isolate\n|Milk protein isolate\n|Whey protein isolate\n|Grams of Sugar\n|Free of “Natural” and Artificial Flavors\n|Free of Gums & Thickeners\nLots of red flags here, you guys!\nHere are the biggest ones …\n- Protein sources: Most Optifast meal replacement shakes contain milk protein concentrate or soy protein. Dairy-based protein powders are associated with many negative health effects. Whey can certainly work if you can tolerate it and you’re trying to build lean body mass (there’s plenty of evidence to support it in that regard). However, if you any type of gut sensitivities, you should avoid whey because it can promote inflammation. Same goes for soy.\n- Sugar: As you can see, Optifast “nutritional” shakes contain anywhere from 4 to 12 grams of sugar, depending on the product. In case you haven’t heard, there’s a mountain of evidence that shows eating sugar that doesn’t come from fruit makes you fat and is correlated with a wide range of other health issues.\n- Natural flavors: Like nearly all protein powders and shakes, Optifast uses the innocuous-sounding “natural” flavors. The Environmental Working Group, in an article titled “The FDA Failed Us,” had this to say about natural flavors: The term “natural flavor” finds its way into more than a quarter of EWG’s roster of 80,000 foods in the Food Scores database, with only salt, water and sugar mentioned more frequently on food labels. “Artificial flavors” are also very common food additives, appearing on one of every seven labels. What do these terms really mean? Good question. The truth is that when you see the word “flavor” on a food label, you have almost no clue what chemicals may have been added to the food under the umbrella of this vague term. For people who have uncommon food allergies or are on restricted diets, this can be a serious concern. In addition to the flavor-adding chemicals themselves, flavor mixtures often contain natural or artificial emulsifiers, solvents and preservatives that are called “incidental additives,” which means the manufacturer does not have to disclose their presence on food labels. Flavoring mixtures added to food are complex and can contain more than 100 distinct substances. The non-flavor chemicals that have other functional properties often make up 80 to 90 percent of the mixture.\n- Corn- and soy-based fillers, additives, and gums: All Optifast products contain a lot of additives and gums, many of which can be disruptive to gut health. Maltodextrin, a corn-based thickener/filler, is the second or third ingredient for most of their shakes. While research published in the International Journal of Sport Nutrition and Exercise Metabolism shows maltodextrin to be safe for healthy young athletes who use it for post-exercise glycogen resynthesis, other studies show it causes insulin spikes, may suppress the growth of probiotics, can cause allergic reactions and side effects, and is almost always made from pesticide-ridden, GMO corn.\n- Organic: There are zero organic ingredients in Optifast’s meal replacement drinks and protein powders. This means you’re getting a healthy dose of pesticides and herbicides with that protein shake.\nBottom Line: Are Optifast Shakes and Powders Good for You?\nThe facts are Optifast shakes a) are not organic; b) have a lot of sugar; c) contain lots on corn- and soy-based additives, fillers, and other junk ingredients.", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}
{"id": "6276", "text": "Quest for the Invisibles\nNik Hayes - Phoenix Probe International - UFO/Paranormal Conference, Lytham St. Annes, Blackpool, September 2019.\n(Photograph - Laura Sayers)\nThere exists an entire world around us that cannot be seen. It is said that the human eye sees only about 2.5% of the electromagnetic spectrum, so over the years many people have questioned what is hidden from us. One of these people was Trevor James Constable, a pioneer who first began his work in the Californian desert in the 1950s, photographing what he considered to be UFO-type objects and strange biological life-forms traversing the skies in the infrared part of the spectrum. Although many of the invisible UFOs he photographed were disc or saucer-like in appearance, Constable discovered that these were in fact living beings, as opposed to being of a mechanical nature, and he held that when these objects became visible they were mutually confused with spacecraft. A quarter of a century later, teams of engineers and technicians from both Italy and Romania, who unaware of Constable's 1958 discoveries, obtained virtually identical infrared photographs of invisible UFOs and other aerial phenomena that were published in Italy in 1980. Despite this, the so called \"UFO experts\" have consistently failed to recognise the importance of these findings, preferring instead to perpetuate the myth that all UFO manifestations must be interplanetary spaceships and nothing else, a myth which has sadly become the mainstay of modern-day ufology.\nAfter my own low altitude encounter with a strange pulsating UFO on Christmas day evening 2008, I ultimately ended up with a lot more questions than answers. With mainstream science failing to rise to the challenge, and official ufology seemingly totally unable to provide any real explanation for this type of phenomenon, I knew I would have to look elsewhere to find the solution. The UFO I encountered that evening appeared to be made of energy or pure light, as opposed to being a solid physical object, and as it moved slowly and silently overhead it reminded more of something from the deep ocean, rather than a spacecraft. In the end, it was only Trevor James Constable who could provide me with a satisfactory explanation for what I saw in the sky that night, and I believe that his findings hold the key that will help unlock the UFO mystery.\nFig:1 shows the visible UFO I encountered on that freezing Christmas day evening in 2008, whilst walking my dog Alfie. This image is taken from movie-mode footage, recorded at 29 fps on my standard Casio Exilim digital camera. The object appeared to be made of energy or pure light, and as it moved slowly above my position at no more than walking pace it appeared to be breathing.\nFig:2 shows an embossed, and slightly enlarged version of the same image, and it's dome-like top and bottom have now become more evident. This encounter completely changed my life, and would ultimately lead to my later photographic work with Quest for the Invisibles.\nQuest for the Invisibles is dedicated to continuing on with the work first started by Trevor James Constable, trying new techniques and using equipment that just wasn't available when he first began probing the infrared in the 1950s. The skies of planet Earth, like its oceans, are full of life and other strange anomalies that exist in a spectrum invisible to normal human sight, but thanks to advances in technology it has now become much easier to take a glimpse into this unknown realm. There are so many aspects to the hidden reality surrounding us, and over the last few years I have documented a whole of host of strange phenomena, not just up in the skies, but also at a much lower altitude, and many of these revealing photographs appear in my book Quest for the Invisibles which was recently published by The Book Tree. Just as Trevor James Constable stated in his book The Cosmic Pulse of Life, there is no better time in history for looking into this invisible world than right now, and a whole multitude of new discoveries await those prepared to explore this normally unseen borderland.

These values drive development of our platform, relationships with our customers and partners, and further the ReliaQuest promise of security confidence across our customers and our own teams.\n“New year, clean slate” may be the resolution for many people eager to leave 2023 behind. But it’s not so simple for cybersecurity defenders as we enter 2024; last year left a lingering impact from several disruptive cyber-threat events. Optimism isn’t a bad approach, but renewed vigilance is a better one.\nLet’s review the leftovers we’ll continue to observe in 2024 (they’re not all bad!): novel ransomware extortion techniques, the use of artificial intelligence (AI) to automate attacks, and disruptions of major cybercriminal marketplaces and malware networks. What can we do better to address these in the context of a new year?\nFrom a law-enforcement perspective, 2023 was a bountiful year. In the first half, law-enforcement agencies took down several established and well-known English-language cybercriminal platforms, including Genesis Market and BreachForums. The operations drove many English-speaking users to Russian-language forums, such as XSS.\nNew forums—Exposed, KKKSec, PwnedForums—quickly mushroomed to fill the gap. But instead, many cybercriminals came to see these platforms as either operationally negligent or honeypots (sites set up to entrap users who intend to engage in illicit behavior). Even Exposed—purportedly a new BreachForums, launched in June 2023—prompted one user of a Russian-language forum to say they were “highly confident” that the site was an FBI honeypot.\nAuthorities also dismantled the “Hive” and “ALPHV” (aka BlackCat) ransomware groups, seizing control of their servers and websites, and issuing a decryption tool for 500-plus organizations compromised by ALPHV to recover their systems and files. The Hive operation seemingly spelled the group’s demise: They haven’t been seen since. But ALPHV has shown resilience, naming several newly compromised entities on a new data leak site.\nTo round it off, the FBI also led a multinational operation that successfully disabled the “QakBot” (aka QBot) malware loader. Prior to the takedown, ReliaQuest had identified QakBot as the most used malware loader, accounting for more than one third of all such activity.\nIn the murky world of the dark web, trust has proven the hardest commodity to acquire. The takedowns of 2023 were highly effective in disrupting cybercriminal transactions and dialogue, and the deep reluctance to adopt new platforms will probably stick.\nOn the flip side, new threat actors will flock to established forums, such as XSS and Exploit. This will potentially create an even more concentrated pool of discussions about malicious cyber activity, and could foster closer collaborations.\nRansomware attacks continued to wreak the most financial and reputational damage throughout 2023; but it was the “Clop” ransomware group’s MOVEit campaign that caught the public eye, for its scale and extortion method. By exploiting a zero-day vulnerability (CVE-2023-34362) in the MOVEit managed file transfer software, more than 2,600 organizations were reportedly affected. ReliaQuest provided real-time updates on the campaign while it unfolded.\nLikely because such a large number of organizations were breached, Clop told affected entities they would need to confirm their compromise and initiate negotiations for ransom—while they sat back and awaited the rewards. This move garnered significant publicity, bolstered Clop’s notoriety, and probably put them in a better place to collect payments in future activity.\nALPHV also took extortion to the “nth” degree by having the audacity to file a US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) complaint against one of the organizations named on its data-leak site (i.e., an entity it had compromised). ALPHV pointed out to the SEC that the breached company hadn’t complied with new cyber-attack disclosure regulations This hallmark event marked the first public confirmation of a ransomware group reporting an organization to the SEC to pressure them into making payment.\nThese and other bold tactics (see our deep dive covering 2023 ransomware and extortion trends) showcase the continuing innovation at play in the ransomware scene. There’s only one aim: squeezing payments out of compromised organizations. And, as companies become more vocal in their refusals to pay ransoms (in some countries, they’re legally forbidden to do so), ransomware groups will resort to even more extreme and unusual ways to extort money. In 2024, we’ll undoubtedly see other inventive methods.\nIn 2023, the chatter about using AI to speed up cyber attacks grew much louder. Threat actors increasingly referred to the generative AI bot ChatGPT on dark-web forums, expressing interest in bypassing its security controls.\nWhere there’s demand, there’s supply. Perpetrators started offering proofs of concept (PoC) to bypass ChatGPT’s filters: “WormGPT” and “FraudGPT,” which are allegedly both ChatGPT black-hat (malicious tools used to gain unauthorized access to computer networks and systems) equivalents Their prices are relatively affordable—around $1,000 a year gets you a subscription. They promise highly enticing possibilities: develop malware, create hacking tools, produce grammatically impeccable emails to conduct business email compromise (BEC), and more.\nSecurity researchers are going head-to-head with cybercriminals, trying to stay ahead of the game by anticipating how AI can progress the nature of cyber attacks. In March 2023, researchers released a PoC, named Black Mamba, which demonstrated how AI can be used to generate polymorphic malware. That’s a type of malware that can repeatedly cause mutation of its appearance or signature files, via new decryption routines.\nBlack Mamba exploits a large language model to synthesize polymorphic keylogging functions. It dynamically alters code at runtime, without connecting to a command-and-control server to deliver or verify the keylogger. Although it’s still in early development stages, Black Mamba demonstrates how LLMs can be abused to combine common malicious actions in unusual ways. The desired end result for threat actors would be better evasion from detection from security systems trained to recognize certain behavioral patterns.\nWhether or not these tools can deliver all they promise remains uncertain. What’s undisputable is that AI will increasingly grease the wheels for highly efficient and targeted cyber attacks in 2024. We’ll see more instances of AI powering flawless phishing campaigns (see our insights on detecting phishing and BEC here). Also, look for it to act as a coding assistant to malware developers, scan for vulnerabilities at speed, and devise crafty defense-evasion techniques based on lessons learned in previous intrusions.\nJust as threat actors are looking to capitalize on lessons from past attacks, we’re ingesting new data all the time and refining our insights to ensure security teams are always pointed in the right direction.

{"id": "6351", "text": "Anonymous Shirdi Sai Devotee from USA says: Om Sai Ram. I am a small Baba Devotee. I get number of miracles in our daily life. Thank You Baba and other God’s for Your miracles and to show solutions to our family. Thank You Baba, Lord Venkateswara Swamy, Goddess Alimelu Mangamma and Lord Ayyappa for Your miracles show on our family. I read every day this blog and get inspired by all other devotee’s experiences. Thank You Hetal Ji and the team for your hard work, time and efforts for the blog. May Baba Bless you all for ever.\nExperience 1: I usually get lot of miracles by Baba’s grace. One day I was in my mom’s call then she told me that she is been visiting hospitals number of times to get diagnosed her problem in stomach. Doctors were not able to diagnose, she had stomach ache continuously almost every day. Doctors took lot of X-rays, tests etc; but all were in vain. The same thing she shared with me. I took it easy for two days then I started crying with my friend by sharing with her and Baba. She said nothing to worry. Then I prayed Baba. I told same to my Mother that don’t worry about your problem, Baba is there to take care of you. I called her after couple of days, enquired about her problem. My mother said doctors were able to diagnose her problem. They said take medications first, don’t worry about surgery and postponed. Just before their conclusion, the incident took place that my mom started from home to go to hospital, on the way one lady waved hand at my mom and called her, given Guru Charitra Book to my mom and explained how she need to read that. My brother and mom surprised because there were number of people in bus-stop and the lady called my mom only and handed over the Parayan Book. It’s purely Baba’s miracle showed on my mom. Baba definitely take care of my mom’s health.\nExperience 2 : My brother is been sick from his child hood. He takes medicines and changed many doctors and visited many hospitals. Finally Baba came to my mom’s dream and told her not to worry about his health. She marked that date in her calendar (that is complete curable date). Mean while one uncle informed us about good hospital near by our town. My brother visited there. Doctor was nice and given medicines. There on wards he started taking medicines and used to enjoy nice food also. Earlier he was not able to take food properly. We believed Baba showed mercy on him. I visited India. I have seen happiness in my mom and brother. I felt happy too about them. I came back from vacation then his health got triggered again. He started suffering so badly, mom shared with me same and felt bad. I prayed Baba about him and this made me gloomy for couple of days. One day I talked to my mom and asked about him, she informed that they went to Kerala to get medicine through the information from my child hood friend’s dad. My brother started using medicine with strict diet but couple of days he suffered a lot. Then my Guru ji and well wisher saw those medicines told, it would trigger for few days and it will calm down health issues. Fortunately he is also from Kerala. I believed Baba listened our prayers and showed us way here. Now I see my brother is bit active. Thank You Baba.\nExperience 3 : By God’s grace (Lord Venkateswara Swami, Goddess Alimelu Mangamma, Lord Ayyappa, Goddess Durga ma and Lord Baba) my daughter always used to get good marks. Last week first time she lost marks and her percentile came down then I felt sad and showed it to Baba. Then One week we sat with her and made her to understand the concepts, mean while praying Gods. I started one day Parayan on Thursday, My mom also prayed for her in Tirumala Lord Balaji temple. Teacher given choice second time. On my Parayan day, Goddess Alimelu Mangamma dropped flower, Lord Venkateswara Swamy dropped flower couple of times. I felt its positive sign. I finished Parayan and went to Baba’s temple. I came back in the evening, my mom called me couple of times from Tirumala (Lord Balaji’s Place) to find out about my daughter test result. Finally I saw that paper. Miracle! she got all of them correct and scored 100 percent. Thank You all Gods and Baba for biggest miracle. I know thank You is small word. Sorry for my lengthy post. Please bless every one Baba who need you. Thank You all Gods for showing miracles on my family. Bless every one. Om Sai Ram.\nAnonymous Shirdi Sai Devotee from India says: Sai Ram to all devotees. Thank you hetal ji for creating this wonderful platform. It helps to increase our faith and devotion to our Baba. It’s true that without His grace not even a grass can move. He is the universe. I entered my final year with only fear, anxious and later depression. Everyday I have a doubt whether I pass or fail, because of my first year experience. Days went my friends everyone entered internship, 6 months left for me to enter internship. Days passed by I couldn’t bear my stress, frustration, workload, pressure by seeing friends, parents pressure. I used to go to Baba’s temple often during my third year, after entering final year due to my Saturday exams I couldn’t go properly. No one was near me as I stayed in hostel. Days became darker I couldn’t concentrate properly many times my study mood was not there. I used to cry often before Baba.\nSuddenly on one fine day in may 2017 I decided to go to Baba temple. After seeing Him, at that moment I thought He is my Guru, He is my everything. After that things started changing little by little I found this site and Shirdi Baba question and answer site. Faith in Baba began to grow. In library I used to study there I got friendship with one of my junior boys. Later I came to know he is a strong believer of Baba. He used to boost me whenever I’m low. Baba guided me, Baba made me study. On the day before of my exam I was lethargic I didn’t have a feel to study, I cried in front of Baba later I started studying. Every exam is a miracle. Whatever question I study at the last minute It was in the question paper, that was all because of Baba’s blessing. My surgery exam was a bit sad one, because on believing my intusion which baba made me realize its wrong I was afraid that I would not clear that exam He gave me confidence and focus for the next exam. Junior boy comes for some exam he gives me some kind of tips and go. That boost me still. Hetal ji this blog only thing gave me potential, faith during my exam times. It helped me a lot. Thanks a lot Baba.\nNext come my practical which was really hectic as it was continuous and toughest. First one surgery, the case which I left was the one important. My friend who is also Baba devotee suddenly called me and informed that case is for tomorrow’s discussion. I read the whole night with Baba’s grace I was able to answer everything. Next my medicine which is toughest. I prepared the whole night but still one more system was left I couldn’t study. I was praying, crying in front of Baba that I should not get that system. Through Baba’s blessings I got the system which was familiar to me. Next is OG, everyone said both externals and internals are strict and questions were difficult to answer. I prayed to Baba, the next morning was crying whole night didn’t sleep, miracle took place the case I learnt thoroughly came and other miracle I was able to answer all the questions. Next is pediatrics quite difficult one Baba helped it through my friend whose name is Saiba. He made me study what all I left and what all they have going to ask.\nAfter these exams I was scared for my results. I did 9weeks fasting, I wrote 1008 Sai Ram book, did 7days fasting. On the day of my result morning I read devotees experience which was exactly similar to mine and was happy that result of that devotee was all clear. I was waiting and by evening 4.45 results came and through Baba’s blessings I cleared in all subjects and entered internship. Thank You Baba. I want Your blessings. I want You to see Baba, feel You and be with You. I know You are with me but please show me Your presence. Baba I love You. Baba Please take away my laziness, please help me to improve my English language, more responsible. Om Sai Sree Sai Jaya Jaya Sai. Show me Your presence Deva.\nAnonymous Shirdi Sai Devotee from India says: I am a small devotee of our Guru Deva. I am thankful to Hetal ji she has made such a wonderful place where we can share our experiences of our Guru Deva. I am a devotee of our Datta Guru from 2015. I come closer to Him when I saw his photo in Facebook. After seeing the photo I want to know more about Him .Then I search in google about Gurudev. I felt that I knew my Guru from many birth. Then the word miracle of Sai come in my mind. I searched about the miracle of Sai Baba. Then I come to know about this website. I always try to read all miracles whenever I have time.\nI am from IT background. I was working in a company which was very small but for some time reason I had left my job in May 31 2017 and I was undergone a small surgery of cyst in back side. I took rest for about 10 days. After that I got an opportunity to join in a software company. I was asked to join immediately in 12/6/2017. So I joined in that company For within one week everything was going nice. But after that I was in work load pressure. They always pressure me to complete job within one or two if the project is for 10 or 15 days and another thing is that I could not be able to satisfy them all. As I was working in a small software firm there is no technical people to handle me i I was in trouble. If the HR person and superior people insulted me in front of everyone, I could not tolerate that all. What I did they would always like to find pros and cons of me. And the situation has become worst. Then I resigned from the job after two months.\nAfter resigning from the I was jobless for two months. Then I thought I will do Nav Guru Vrat. I did Nav Guru Vrat at the 7th week I got an interview call. I attended the interview on the next day of calling. After two days I got an interview call from another company. Then interview went well. As I had experience they have selected me and they asked me to join at 3/10/2017 after completion of Durga Pooja. I joined on 3/10/2017. Now I am very happy with this job that our Datta Guru gave me. I bow my head in front our Guru. Love You Deva. If there is any mistake please forgive me Deva. Now I life is in Your hand. I started my morning with the name of our Guru and end my day with name of our Guru. Always believe Him firmly. He is omnipotent. I have got so many experiences of our Guru.

Actually Sai is everything for me, I can’t imagine my life without my Sai’s blessings. Thank you Hetal ji and team for providing such a wonderful platform to share our beloved Sai’s experiences. Coming to my experiences, I have experienced lots and lots of Sai miracles in my life and i have even posted some of them here, some are published and some are yet to publish. Here I am again with a new miracle.

Thank You so much Deva for all the help and everything You do for us, we are nothing without Sai, nothing. Because what ever we have with us now is just Your Biksha on us and we are always thankful for everything You have done for us.\nBaba my kids love You much, they include You in everything in their happiness, in their sorrows, even if they want to write anything in their school they include in their essays and their notes, Baba please protect them always and please keep Your blessing on them for ever. I want my kids to follow Your path and always be humble and helpful to others You have always protected me like a small kid, I share everything with, I cry in front of You, i fight with You, only because its only You who understand me Baba, who else I have other then You Sai, You are my everything Deva.

I do not know the reason, the pain was unbearable. I couldn’t even breathe. I took some Baba’s Udi and applied Udi on the place of pain. I wrote letter to my Guru ji (Sarath Babu ji) Stating My Pain. I prayed Baba and Guru ji for curing my pain. In 10 min my pain vanished. I got relief. But my father insisted on visiting a doctor. So I took doctor’s Appointment today. I pray Baba that everything should be fine and there should be no Major issues regarding this pain. Thank You Baba for being with me.

{"id": "6378", "text": "Why My Resolutions Are Entirely Selfish This Year\n2018 was a hard year. There were plenty of busy times, family matters, and some real low points. Our journey through the IVF process has been crushingly difficult, and I’ve found more excuses to put myself second or third.\nEvery time something came up that I thought would be fun, I’d say “no, I should help out at home” or I’d put off doing the things that make me happy to support my wife or relieve her after her full day of taking care of our daughter.\nI’ve also been emotionally eating. A lot! I’ve breached the 200 lbs mark that I swore I’d never reach since my descent from 270 lbs down to my usual weight of between 180 – 185 lbs.\nAt first the weight started to sneak on, then I went full force into a whirlwind of carbs and finished it off with “Well, it’s Christmas”.\nNow I don’t feel so great. In fact I feel terrible. Things have to change and January 1st seems like the perfect time. However, unlike most new year’s resolutions, this one is going to stick.\n#1. To take more ‘me’ time.\nI’m so lucky to have an incredible wife who has told me on several occasions that I need to do things that make me happy. I just need to actually do them. These include:\n- Going for walks and taking lots of photos\n- Going to the gym\n- Watching the BC Lions\n- Actually thinking of things that I like doing but have put aside for so long I’ve forgotten.\n#2. Losing weight\nThis isn’t just a general “I’d like to be more healthy” resolution. I’m going to stop eating to suppress feelings and distract myself from things that are making unhappy. I will actively count my calories and not go above 1,500 – 1,600 kcals per day. I will go to the gym and get in a proper workout 4 times per week. No excuses.\n#3 Saying ‘No’\nI am too often the first to say yes even when I have no desire to do the favour that puts me out. I’ll give away the things that I really wanted, or decide that my time is less valuable than someone else’s. This has to end. If I don’t want to do something, I’m going to say ‘no’. Of course, I’ll probably phrase it a little more politely, but the ‘no’ is the point. My time is just as valuable as anyone else and I’m not making myself miserable just so someone else can put their feet up. I’m tired too!\nMy reasons for being selfish aren’t entirely self-centered. To be a better father and husband, I need to be happy, healthy, and balanced. I want to be overflowing with energy, kindness, and love, which I can only give when I’m taking care of myself too.\nWho’s with me? What’s your resolution and are you choosing something that’s entirely for you?", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

{"id": "6396", "text": "Simply stated, special hazard fire protection are fire suppression systems that are used to protect property and life from fire in situations where a traditional automatic fire sprinkler system may be inappropriate, or even hazardous. Within the International Building and Fire Codes, these systems are called “Alternative Automatic Fire-Extinguishing Systems.” Herein, they will be referred to as “Special Hazard Fire Protection.”\nExamples of Special Hazard Fire Protection Systems include, but are not limited to:\n• High Expansion Foam Systems and Foam-Water Sprinkler Systems – these systems are designed to protect against liquid fires commonly found in aircraft hangars or areas where flammable liquids are stored or handled. They extinguish liquid fires by smothering the surface of the liquid with a blanket-like foams. Industrial fires that involve flammable and combustible liquids may also use this type of system.\n• Clean Agent Systems – these systems are gaseous extinguishing agents that are either inert gases or Fluorine based compounds. They suppress fires without damaging electronically sensitive equipment or equipment that is susceptible to water damage. Fluorine based compounds work predominantly by absorbing the heat from a fire, thereby lowing its temperature, and in the case of inert gases, by displacing the available oxygen to burn.\n• Dry and Wet Chemical Systems – these systems work by blanketing the surface of burning materials with chemicals that disrupt the burning of the fire. A simple dry chemical agent is sodium bicarbonate (baking soda), which can be used to extinguish a cooking fire. Wet Chemical Systems are often used to extinguish fires within oil fryer cooking apparatus.\n• Condensed Aerosol Systems – these systems work by using a propellant and particulate to extinguish fire. They work predominantly by arresting the chemical chain reaction necessary for a fire to propagate.\nUnderstanding the type of extinguishant used in special hazard fire protection is an important differentiator among the various systems. Another differentiator is the application type. There are two application categories, local application systems and total flooding systems.\nA local application system, which is most commonly found in industrial fire protection, is used to protect a working space, specific equipment, or a partially enclosed area. Engine compartments, IT closets, electrical switchgear, and kitchen hoods are all examples of special hazard fire protection systems in local applications. Local application systems are normally pre-engineered for the hazard. On the other hand, total flooding systems are intended to suppress fires within an entire room or enclosed space. These systems must be specifically engineered for the space and hazard.\nMethod of activation is another way to distinguish the various types of special hazard fire protection systems. Systems can be activated manually (mechanical means), automatically (electrical or thermal means), or both (a single system can be activated in multiple ways). Mechanical activation may occur by having a suppression head fuse and open (such as in some dry chemical systems), or by pulling an activation handle (such as in kitchen suppression systems). Electronic heat or smoke detectors activate other systems. They work by sending an activation signal to a control panel or solenoid valve, which in turn, activates the system.\nSpecial Hazard Fire Protection Systems are required to be monitored by a building fire alarm system if one is present. If one is not present, they are not necessarily required to be monitored.", "scores": {"score": 3, "score_transform_1": 5, "score_transform_2": 5, "score_transform_3": 0}}
{"id": "6398", "text": "Spot prices appear to have turned a corner as a growing percentage of both service centers and their manufacturing customers report steel prices on the decrease.\nAs the chart below shows, 24 percent of the service centers responding to Steel Market Update’s questionnaire this past week now say they are lowering prices to their customers. That is three times the 8 percent who were lowering prices a few weeks ago. Early in March, 21 percent said they were increasing prices following the late February price increase of $40 announced by the mills. It appears the coronavirus may have derailed the mills’ hopes for higher prices anytime soon.\nStill, the vast majority (70 percent) said they were keeping prices the same, while 6 percent were still raising prices, so the degree to which steel prices will be impacted by the market’s reaction to the virus remains far from clear.\nManufacturers, the service centers’ customers, confirmed the downturn in spot prices. Thirty-seven percent reported they were seeing decreasing prices from their service center suppliers, and none reported seeing rising prices. The last time a higher percentage of manufacturers reported declining prices was back in October prior to the series of price increases announced by the mills. Those increases took the benchmark price for hot rolled from a 2019 low of $470 a ton to $610 per ton in mid-January. Since then, even before the virus, the price had struggled to sustain any traction.

{"id": "6400", "text": "Yesterday the United States Supreme Court issued a long-anticipated decision in City of Ontario v. Quon, unanimously ruling that a search of sexually explicit personal text messages sent by a police officer using his department pager was reasonable and did not violate the individual officer’s privacy rights. At issue was the right of a government employer to monitor its workers private communications because it believed employer-owned equipment was being abused. Even if a public employee has a legitimate privacy expectation, an employer’s intrusion on that expectation “for noninvestigatory, work-related purposes, as well as for investigations of work-related misconduct, should be judged by the standard of reasonableness under all the circumstances,” Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote. Click here to read the Supreme Court’s full decision in Quon.\nIn Quon, the employer, the City of Ontario, distributed to its police officers pagers with texting capability. The City audited the use of text messages by the officers to determine whether coverage charges may have been caused by personal use of the service. During the audit, it discovered that Quon had sent several personal, sexually explicit text messages. Quon sued the City, asserting violations of his right to privacy under the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution as well as under Article I, Section I of the California Constitution. The federal District Court dismissed Quon’s suit after a jury found that the City conducted the audit to investigate usage, not misconduct. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the City violated Quon’s constitutional privacy rights by reading his private texts, and the City’s articulated policies did not give Quon sufficient notice that his texts could be read by others to overcome his privacy rights. The Ninth Circuit’s decision, which we blogged on the World of Employment, was unanimously overturned by the Supreme Court.\nWhat does the Supreme Court’s decision mean for employers? The Supreme Court issued a narrow ruling in a case involving a public, not private, employer. For most private employers, this case could have little or even no impact because federal privacy rights such as those that come from the U.S. Constitution’s Fourth Amendment apply only to public, and not private, employers. Justice Kennedy cautioned that even with regard to public employers, the “Judiciary risks error by elaborating too fully on the Fourth Amendment implications of technology before its role in society has become clear . . . .” Private California employers should continue to be wary: California courts have sometimes applied state constitutional rights to private employers, and could rule that their employees have privacy rights in work-provided email and text systems. For all employers, whether or not the Fourth Amendment applies to them, it remains a “best practice” to adopt and distribute policies clearly stating that employees have no expectation of privacy in employer-owned equipment, or in communications they make using or interfacing with employer-provided equipment and systems, such as email, text messages, cell phones, social media and other avenues of technology.", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}

These products serve a different purpose from that of existing D&O insurance policies. Some D&O policies do not provide any coverage for FCPA investigation costs. Even if a D&O policy does cover FCPA investigation costs, such D&O coverage is limited to costs incurred by individual company officers and directors and does not cover the company’s costs. The new FCPA insurance products, on the other hand, provide coverage for the company itself. To the extent that there is overlap between a D&O policy and an FCPA policy, the FCPA policy would provide primary coverage in the event of an FCPA investigation, preserving the D&O policy for other suits.”\nThe memo goes on to describe a new product from Marsh USA that “provides coverage for legal, accounting, auditing, and consulting expenses incurred as a result of an FCPA investigation, but does not cover any fines or penalties that might be imposed. Entities and individuals covered by FCPA Corporate Response include the insured company, all subsidiaries, and all persons employed by or otherwise affiliated with or acting at the direction of the company, including independent contractors and consultants. Significantly, FCPA Corporate Response also provides coverage for costs incurred as a result of investigations conducted by foreign regulators pursuant to foreign laws and regulations, such as the U.K. Bribery Act, to the extent that such laws and regulations are compatible with the anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA.”\nSurvey: How Prepared Are Companies for a Crisis?\nThis set of survey results prepared by Pillsbury and Levick Strategic Communications provides interesting insights into how prepared companies think they are for a crisis (here’s the related press release).

{"id": "6469", "text": "The Premier League is finally upon us, as treble winners Manchester City travel to Burnley later tonight. While the 2023/24 season has already kicked-off in many other European countries, there is a certain charm to the Premier League that no other league can mimic. With magicians like Mohammed Salah and Kevin de Bruyne on the field, to artisans like Peter Drury and Jim Beglin in the press box, every game, seemingly, has the potential to be a masterpiece.\nCheckered pitch, overcast skies, and dramatic, yet mostly beautiful football - The Premier League is back!\nFrom the grand, old Old Trafford to the raw, raucous St. James' Park, and the choir of Anfield to the backyards of Kenilworth Road, the Premier League and its colored stages are as diverse as ever this season. Despite the trend of moving to ‘large, soul-less bowls’ like West Ham’s Olympic Stadium or Man City’s Etihad, there is still a good representation of traditional English football grounds. Burnley’s Turf Moor, the longest continually used stadium to ever be in the Premier League, SheffU’s Bramall Lane, the oldest stadium in the world that is still hosting professional football, and Luton’s Kenilworth Road will certainly add to that list.\nLast year saw Arsenal pace the marathon for 33 gameweeks, before peeling off to allow Manchester City to come through. Newcastle secured Champions League football for the first time in twenty years, and it will be interesting to see what the Geordies get up to on their travels. Meanwhile the Reds of Manchester, with Erik Ten Hag at the helm, pipped Liverpool for a top four finish. After years of revolutionary recruiting, smart business, and consistent performances, Brighton added Europa League football to their schedules. And despite a poor domestic season, West Ham made good on their excuse of Conference League priorities.\nIn the bottom half, Chelsea finished a woeful season in 12th. An enthralling relegation battle saw Everton spare their blushes. Leeds, Leicester, and Southampton went down.\nThis season, a glowed-up Burnley, Sheffield United, and Luton Town will join the English top-flight. With Luton’s stadium having gained popularity for its eccentric intricacies, that first Hatters home game will have many curious viewers.\nNothing like a photograph of a football supporters walking to their Temple of choice on yet another Saturday afternoon. Luton Town Football Club, featured in this picture, are back in the top-flight after 30 odd years and they play in the 10,000 seater Kenilworth Road - the smallest stadium in the Premier League. (\"On the way to Kenilworth Road”, by dom fellowes, licensed under CC BY-NC 2.0)\nWhile the movement of players to Saudi Arabia made the big headlines, there were some big signings in the Premier League. Chelsea seemingly flushed their entire squad out, after a miserable campaign last season, and certainly overpaid for ‘wonderkids’ around the globe. Arsenal poached fellow Premier League clubs, thereby strengthening themselves and weakening others (a new approach to a six-pointer), with signings like Declan Rice, Kai Havertz, and David Raya. The biggest transfer news of this summer may still be in the making, as Harry Kane’s departure from Spurs seems imminent. If the English skipper does sign for Bayern Munich, he will leave 47 goals short of the Premier League scoring record.\nUSA’s number one Matt Turner looks set to make his Premier League debut this weekend against Arsenal, after he was picked up by Nottingham Forest a few days ago. Meanwhile, David de Gea bade his farewell to Manchester United and the Premier League, after twelve glorious years. Andre Onana, who is notoriously good with his feet, will be his replacement. The Red Devils also copped Mason Mount from his boyhood club, much to the disappointment of Chelsea fans.\nThe major (confirmed) departures from the Premier League include Wilfried Zaha from Crystal Palace, İlkay Gündoğan and Riyad Mahrez from Manchester City, Fabinho and Firmino from Liverpool, Alan Saint-Maximin from Newcastle, Granit Xhaka from Arsenal, and half of Chelsea’s old squad.\nKeeping all this in mind, here are my (not so expert) predictions for this coming season. Starting from the bottom, I expect Luton Town, Wolves, and Forest to go down. Sheffield United and Everton will just escape relegation. Bournemouth, Crystal Palace, Fulham, West Ham, and Brentford will make up the rest of the bottom half.\nAston Villa, and a Kane-less Spurs will form the bottom of the top half. Kompany’s Burnley are my dark horses and will finish 8th, while the ever-consistent Brighton will end one spot ahead of them. I expect much better from Chelsea, under Pochettino, however their hasty squad makeover will not get them better than 6th. Newcastle will not be able to defend their Champions League spot, as they will secure 5th.\nFinally, my top four comprises of Liverpool, Manchester United, Arsenal, and Manchester City. I think the title race will get intense towards the culmination of the season, but Arsenal, with their bolstered squad, will pip City to become champions.\nThere you have it – my predictions for the 2023/24 season. If you think otherwise about any it, feel free to have a go at me in the comment section (we can debate). Whatever happens, it will be fun to look back on at the end of the season.\nMen of all ages walking up to the London Stadium, to watch the Hammers take on Aston Villa in the 22/23 Premier League season. The large, oval, 'bowl' is not a crowd favorite but for the love of the club, it will be packed nonetheless this season.\nAnyways, the anticipation for the opening game week has been building up over the past few days, only amplified by the ongoing transfer sagas of Harry Kane, Tyler Adams, and Moisés Caicedo. But amidst all this, one has to wonder – is the Premier League actually that special? Or is it just the years of heavy marketing in the English-speaking World, and well-tuned broadcasts that make the Premiership so appealing to television audiences like us?\nI truly do not know, and I do not want to spoil the mood, but that is something to think about.

After the Lufthansa Group’s investment in ITA Airways, announced in May, it doesn’t come as much of a surprise that Jettainer, wholly-owned by Lufthansa Cargo, has been asked to continue with the cargo equipment management for the Italian flag carrier. As for the data handling, ITA Airways Cargo has reported cooperation agreements with two partners.\nJettainer is set to continue supporting ITA Airways, providing the successor to Alitalia with a fleet of around 4,000 air cargo containers and pallets. Managing this cargo transport equipment is supported by IT solutions and a team of supervisors. The service thus promises transparency in the field of ULD deployment and the highest possible utilisation rates, including avoiding (empty) positioning flights, reduced costs and lower CO2 emissions.\nThe airline serves a growing network of destinations in Europe, Africa, Asia and North, Central and South America, through its hubs at Rome Fiumicino and Milan Linate. “Jettainer provides us with the reliability we expect and need to deliver our services,” Francesco Presicce, ITA Airways’ CTO and ‘accountable manager’, said. At the same time, Jettainer’s “innovative management systems contribute to the efficient and cost-effective operation of our airline,” he added.\nIncreasing online and offline visibility\nMeanwhile, the SkyTeam Cargo member has joined Wisetech’s ‘Global Carrier Connectivity’ programme. The scheme was designed to enable freight forwarders to efficiently plan, book, confirm and manage shipments flown by the air transport service provider in real time, using the Australian logistics IT provider’s ‘Cargowise’ booking platform.\nThe direct data connections to the freight management platform established by an API – ITA Airways Cargo has chosen ‘Cargospot’ from Champ Cargosystems for this purpose – provides access to offers from 24 of the 25 largest freight forwarders worldwide.\nITA Airways’ chief commercial officer Emiliana Limosani pointed out that “our growing presence on online cargo booking portals is another important pillar of our overall business development strategy for the future.”\nITA’s online presence was launched with Cargo One in October last year (see also page 13 of our Italy Special supplement in ITJ 47-48 / 2022). On 19 October, in turn, freight forwarders based in the greater Milan area were invited to a customer information event, where they were presented with the details and advantages of the system.", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}
{"id": "6530", "text": "Launched late last year, the Maya Train is touted as one of Mexico's greatest infrastructure projects this century, and it's not hard to see why: it has revolutionized travel in the Caribbean states, linking the bustling resort city of Cancun to key spots in Quintana Roo, Yucatan, and beyond.\nIf you're an American tourist landing in Cancun, you can now easily board the train and visit other beautiful destinations in the Mayan Riviera or the Yucatanese hinterland in a safe manner and without paying exorbitant private transfer fees, nor resort to overpriced tour operators.\nWhile the Cancun to Palenque route has been up and running since December, the long-awaited Southeast-bound route, which will call at the beach town of Tulum, was not finalized for the inaugural journey on December 1.\nWhen Will The Cancun-Tulum Train Launch?\nFast forward a month, and tourists are yet to be able to get to Tulum with the popular train.\nThis has been a cause of disappointment for some, especially vacationers who headed to Tulum this winter, who are still not protected from abusive transfer fares or are required to trust local buses.\nIn response to the criticism, Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador (AMLO) has finally confirmed the launch not only of the Cancun-Chetumal line (calling at Tulum), but the completion date of the whole of the Maya Train, and all stations that have been promised.\nAccording to AMLO, the Maya Train will open fully by summer, after June 2, at the earliest, once the election passes.\nThis means tourists flying to Tulum over summer will no longer be ‘isolated', in terms of rail connectivity, from the rest of Quintana Roo and the wider Yucatan peninsula.\nRight now, the easiest way to reach Tulum landing in Cancun is booking a private or shared transfer, though they can easily cost a whopping $180 one-way, and that's no guarantee it will be stress-free or particularly smooth.\nOther than being expensive, the journey takes around 1.5 and 2 hours to complete, and that's without considering the region's crazy traffic and already-expected congestion, as the route 307 linking Cancun to Tulum is one of the busiest in Mexico.\nThe budget option is the ADO buses – $25 – but if you're coming to the Caribbean on a luxurious holiday, cramming yourself into local public transport is probably not something you're keen on experiencing.\nHow Long Will The Cancun-Tulum Train Take?\nWhile we don't know yet how long trains departing from Cancun will take to arrive at Tulum, it's safe to say they will be a lot quicker and a much more affordable alternative.\nEconomy tickets on available routes sell for around $43 one-way, and the train is generally on time.\nWe can, however, offer you an estimate. The distance between Cancun and Tulum is 81 miles: taking into account the train's speed time, set at 160 km/h for now, it would take around 48 minutes and 53 seconds to reach Tulum, traveling nonstop.\nOf course, that won't be the case, as there are two further planned stops at Puerto Morelos and Playa Del Carmen.\nEither way, the journey is expected to last just under or an hour, without delays. This means it will be incredibly easy for tourists based in Cancun to get to Tulum for the day and back, and vice-versa.\nCancun and Tulum are two of the trendiest beach areas in the Mayan Riviera. The latter is a bustling resort city and tropical getaway home to luxurious all-inclusives and a long stretch of white-sandy beach. As for Tulum, it is all that, plus a cultural center.\nTulum is where you'll find the iconic postcard view of Mayan ruins sitting atop a tall cliff facing the bright-blue Caribbean, as well as an extensive archaeological zone best known for the intricate details that still survive on temple walls, and the fortress-like, 15th-century Castillo.\nOnce launched next summer, the Cancun-Tulum train will significantly improve connectivity for tourists commuting between these two trendy spots.\nOn top of a passenger train, Tulum is also home to its very own international airport now, with flights from key U.S. cities like Atlanta, Charlotte, Chicago O'Hare, Dallas/Fort Worth, Denver, Fort Lauderdale, Los Angeles, Miami, Newark, New York-JFK and Orlando.\nAs far as we're concerned, with a fast-speed train available and a new aviation hub serving the Southern end of the state of Quintana Roo, the era of long, stressful landside transfers from Cancun to Tulum is officially over.\n↓ Join Our Community ↓\nThe Travel Off Path Community FB group has all the latest travel news, conversations, and Q&A's happening daily!\nSUBSCRIBE TO OUR LATEST POSTS\nEnter your email address to subscribe to Travel Off Path's latest breaking travel news, straight to your inbox.\nThis article originally appeared on TravelOffPath.com\nOpinions expressed here are the author’s alone, not those of any bank, credit card issuer, hotel, airline, or other entity.

{"id": "6541", "text": "On Thursday night, the Twins were reportedly in the “final stages” of completing a trade with the Atlanta Braves for starting pitcher Jaime Garcia. It seemed like a done deal, but by Friday morning, the deal still hadn’t been made. Come Friday afternoon—less than 24 hours since the story broke—the deal appeared to be off.\nJaime Garcia has struggled with injuries in his career, but apparently the medical issues weren’t with him, but with the Twins prospect, who Rosenthal also reported was the hard-throwing Nick Burdi. Burdi, of course, underwent Tommy John surgery in late May and is out for the year. Obviously the Braves would have known that, so it’s strange that the trade talks would have gotten to the final stages before this was brought up as an issue. Burdi has had some other injury issues in the past, so maybe that was the problem. And as MLB Trade Rumors suggests, there could have been another player involved whose medical issues caused the Braves to balk too.\nBefore going out due to injury this year, Burdi had a 0.53 ERA and 20 strikeouts over 17.0 innings pitched in Double-A.\nMeanwhile, Garcia made his start for the Braves against the Dodgers last night in LA, and did nothing but up his potential trade value. He gave up only three earned runs over 7 innings, and most impressively, hit a freakin’ grand slam to provide his own run support. So it’s not all a loss, Twins fans—you can use the PAPASLAM promo code and get 40% off a Papa John’s pizza today, courtesy of Jaime Garcia!\nOf course, it’s still possible a trade could happen, but I dunno. This whole ordeal may have left a bad taste in people’s mouths, like eating a Papa John’s pizza or something.\nWould you have been okay the Twins trading Nick Burdi for Jaime Garcia?\nThis poll is closed\nYes, we need starting pitching help.\nYes, but only if it was a one-for-one deal with no other prospects included.\nNo, Burdi could be an asset in the future. Wouldn’t have been worth it.\nNo, Jaime Garcia isn’t that good. Not worth it.\nI don’t even know who either of these guys are.", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

They explain everything and were very kind.”\nImmediately after birth, during their first critical hours of life, all newborns spend some time in a radiant infant warmer as they adjust to living and breathing on their own. They are also used for vulnerable infants who have returned to the hospital for care. The maternity ward has five radiant warmers but four of them are nearing end-of-life and urgently need replacing. Will you help us help the Women and Children’s Health Unit give children like little Blake and Andi Lacroix a ‘warm welcome’ to our community this Christmas?", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

My parents were supportive and encouraged anything Rachel and I wanted to accomplish; regardless of the time commitment or effort it required.\nRachel and I had an incredible relationship; I grew up with a best friend beside me, cheering me on, every day. Life was beautiful.\nWhen I left for college at SDSU in Brookings, SD, I had two goals; play baseball and become a professional wrestler. And that’s what I did. I was recruited to play D1 baseball at South Dakota State University and after graduation I took on the name Jaxon Stone to pursue a career in pro-wrestling. Despite the distance, my family unit remained connected. They frequently traveled for my games and shows, and I returned home for weekend visits as often as I could. With them by my side, it seemed like I had everything figured out and I was on track to accomplishing my dreams.\nHowever, life came to screeching halt on September 3, 2018. After a 10-year battle with bipolar disorder and severe depression, Rachel died by suicide. Grief, sadness, anger, and pain overwhelmed my body and thoughts. I was numb and did not know how to move forward.\nI realized that these life-altering, paralyzing emotions were similar to the feelings Rachel fought through for over 10 years. These emotions were barriers. They were heavy. And they were real. To move forward and build a new reality for myself, I knew I needed to break them down and process.\nWhile grieving the loss of someone I loved so much, I learned to appreciate the love around me.

{"id": "6683", "text": "What path will a leaf follow floating down a turbulent stream? Is it even possible to make a mathematical model that will predict such motion? Is this the same sort of problem as predicting the path of planets as they move round the sun? Even when we know all the rules governing the motion of an object, and can determine precisely the initial conditions, it turns out that some motions can be predicted and some cannot. And it is not just a matter of complexity: we can model unpredictable systems with very simple equations. In this Vignette we illustrate mathematically the existence of chaotic dynamical systems using the decimal form of real numbers. You will see how the unpredictability can be simply generated. One of the main goals of theoretical models is to make (good) predictions. However, there are deterministic dynamical systems that in practice are unpredictable; they are the so-called chaotic systems. The aim of this text is to discuss how this unpredictability is generated, and the main tool here will be the decimal representation of real numbers.\nBy a deterministic dynamical system we understand a mathematical model with a well-defined (time) evolution rule, in such way that if it is known how the system is configured at the present time, then it is possible (theoretically, at least) to know how it will be configured in the future. A basic example of a deterministic system is given by a (unique) planet around a star; the mathematical model is Newton’s Second Law of Classical Mechanics, and the initial configuration is the position and velocity of the planet at a certain instant of time; from this it it possible to exactly predict its future configurations.\nWith respect to chaotic motions, there are different definitions spread in the specialized literature. At least in one point different authors agree: chaotic motions do exist. In the world of models the term chaos has been used as synonymous with erratic, turbulent, unpredictable, random, irregular, etc., and it has often been observed through numerical simulations and laboratory experiments. Such the term in deterministic systems was popularized by T. Li e J. A. Yorke in the title of a work published in 1975, but its meaning in this context was not the one presented in a dictionary. A familiar example of chaotic motion is given by a small leaf in turbulent water flow.\nComplex behavior in dynamical systems does not require complicated equations! In the following this advantage is used in models based on the decimal representation of real numbers. Thus, the first step will be a short analysis of such representations, before the presentation of the models. The readers are invited to use pencil and paper to check some of the steps ahead.\nThe real numbers in the interval are classified as rationals and irrationals. The rationals are those that can be represented in the form , with natural numbers and , and . The rationals, when represented in the decimal form, are exactly those with a finite number of nonzero digits or with blocks that repeat indefinitely, the so-called repeating decimals. As examples consider and ; it is also possible to occur situations like , which are called repeating as well.\nThe irrational numbers are those whose decimal representations present infinitely many nonzero digits but with no infinitely-repeated portion as in the repeating decimals; maybe the most famous irrational number is , so that is also irrational and belongs to .\nNow, take a closer look at the meaning of writing . The first digit 0 means, clearly, that this number (point) is between and . Since the base is decimal, the digits are used to represent the numbers, then the interval is divided into ten subintervals\nand the digit in means that in this first division of the considered number is in the third one. Now we divide the third subinterval in another ten, that is,\nand the digit says that is, among such subintervals, in the sixth. Since all remaining digits are null, for all subsequent subdivisions this number is always in the first subinterval that starts at , and it is uniquely determined as the lengths of the subintervals in this process tend to zero.\nSome numbers have more than one decimal representation, more precisely two. For instance: It is possible to be convinced of this by analyzing the closed subintervals that contain (i.e., always in the last subintervals – those ending with ), or reasoning as follows: if , then and , so that . These possible doubled decimal representations only occur with repetitions of from a certain position (this is not obvious and asks for a detailed proof that will not be discussed here); below such particular representations will not be considered, so that uniqueness of representation are then guaranteed for all real numbers.\nBy using these remarks about decimal representations, sometimes it is possible to construct numbers suitable to certain purposes; it is enough to choose successive subintervals in a convenient way. This will be fundamental in what follows, in particular in the description of the system with chaotic properties.\nDeterministic systems and chaos\nAs already mentioned, in dynamics the term chaos refers to behaviors that in practice are unpredictable, although generated by deterministic systems. But how is this possible?\nLet’s pass to the discussion of two dynamical systems that, at first glance, may seem similar. The two models are deterministic, the first one does not present chaotic motion and also serves as a warm up, whereas the second one has a richer dynamics. Even though such models are not necessarily directly related to physical situations, they are important by their simple evolution laws, so permitting that their dynamical characteristics may be easily understood.\nExample of regular system\nThis first example does not present chaos, and will be referred to as regular. Its possible configurations are points in the interval with a small modification: the end points and are identified and the interval becomes a circle (think of a rope with the ends glued together). The general rule for working under this identification is simple: if a number is not in , subtract its integer part, which corresponds to the number of full turns around the circle and then returning to the same point (see Figure 1); as an illustration, in case of , the integer part means three full turns that do not modify the configuration of the system, that is, . We also see that the numbers , , and represent the same configuration “”; says that stating at we have gone one full turn; that we have gone exactly full turns, and so on.\nThe temporal evolution is given by a deterministic law; if the initial configuration of the system (it is always supposed to be given at instant ) is , then at instant one the system will be at , at instant two in , and at a generic instant at .\nIt is expected that a deterministic system reaches some kind of equilibrium for large times, which in mathematical language corresponds to take the time “going to infinity”; in symbols . In this example, for large its successive configurations approach zero, and for all initial conditions ; for example, if , then , , etc. The equilibrium is always described by the position zero. It is in fact a regular system.\nIn this subsection a mathematical model with chaotic behavior will be presented. It is a simple adaptation of a well-known system among specialists.\nThe possible configurations of this system are the same of the previous example, that is, an interval with ends identified. The temporal evolution is given by the following law: if is the initial configuration, then at instant the system is in , at instant in and, in a generic instant in . The identification of end points is assumed at each instant of time; thus, if , then and . Here we clearly have a deterministic system as well.\nIt is a good idea to doubly illustrate how to compute the orbit of a initial condition, say : , , , and so on.\nNext some possibilities of equilibrium for this system as are discussed.\nIf , or , we have , and the equilibrium is described by the position . If we have . Similarly, for , it follows that for all . From such cases we see that if is any rational number in whose decimal representation has a finite number of nonzero entries, then the equilibrium will always be described by the zero position.\nIn the case of rational numbers represented by repeating decimals, in general the equilibrium is represented by a periodic orbit. Some examples explain the meaning of a periodic orbit in this context. In case we have , ; hence, whereas , and the equilibrium is described by an orbit of period given by . If , the equilibrium is a periodic orbit of period , that is, , for (and if and in ). The same idea is applied to present examples of orbits of any period.\nIf the initial condition is an irrational number, the equilibrium may be more complicated, there are many possibilities and it may be difficult to describe in some cases; however, undoubtedly it will not be a periodic orbit (since its decimal representation is not repeating) and some possibilities will be discussed ahead.\nAn effective way of estimating the distance between two points in , when given in decimal representation, is to count, from the decimal point, how many successive digits coincide. For example, if and , their distance is less or equal to .\nNow, if represents a digit in and given an initial condition , there exist initial conditions that generate periodic orbits arbitrarily close to (it is the so-called density of periodic orbits). The new initial condition corresponds to a periodic orbit of period whose distance to is less or equal to (if necessary, use blocks , with ). Proceeding in this way, one gets periodic orbits with high periods whose initial conditions are arbitrarily close to . On the other hand, has zero as its equilibrium and its distance to is less than , whereas corresponds to an irrational number whose distance to is less than .\nNow a particular equilibrium generated by some irrational numbers is considered. Let\nwhere are blocks of finitely many digits between and , and they are chosen as follows:\n- belongs to ; note that can be used to localize close to any given number.\n- by dividing into ten subintervals as before, belongs to the first of these subintervals, to the second, , and to the last one. For example: .\n- divide each of the above subintervals into ten, so getting one hundred subintervals. Chose so that belongs to the first of such subintervals, to the second, , to the last one. For example: , and .\nProceeding with subdivisions as above, it is possible to obtain initial conditions that, under time evolution, visit “all parts” of . By all parts it is understood any subinterval of ; the precise technical term is to say that the orbit is dense in . This follows by observing the orbit of ; for instance, it will visit when it reaches , and so on. This behavior (that is, to visit all parts of ) would be the “equilibrium” of this orbit as .\nIt is interesting to note that each one of the blocks can be chosen among many possibilities, which shows that the orbits of infinitely many initial conditions visit all parts of through time evolution. There are other possibilities and the readers are invited to exercise their creativity! Think, for example, of initial conditions whose orbits visit all parts of just the interval .\nWith respect to the above initial condition , recall that can be selected in such way that is very close to any given point of . Thus, there are initial conditions whose orbits spread out all parts of that are arbitrary close to any given periodic initial condition, and also close to initial conditions whose equilibria are described by the position zero. There are, then, at least three types of equilibria whose corresponding initial conditions are intertwined. It is also possible to consider periodic orbits with different periods as distinct types of equilibria; this is left to the taste of each author.\nHence, in this example, in contrast with the previous one, different initial conditions may present different kinds of equilibria. What is still missing to characterize the chaotic motion? Surely such different intertwined behaviors give a flavor of unpredictability to the dynamics, that is, very close to an initial condition there are infinitely many others with different equilibria. Here is another essential ingredient: in practice any initial configuration is known with limited precision, because there is always an experimental or truncation error. In physical systems, besides the limited accuracy of the initial data, there are also small external disturbances which may occur, such as variations in temperature, etc.\nThe picture is now complete: there are very distinct kinds of temporal evolution, whose initial conditions are arbitrarily close to each other, and with the limited accuracy of the initial data, no one knows what kind of equilibrium will be attained as .\nOne of the ingredients for the chaotic behavior is the expansiveness, that is, near points are quickly separated by the temporal evolution (which does not occur in the first example above), and in this example, at each instant of time, the distance between two close points is multiplied by ; this is called sensitivity to initial conditions. As an illustration, suppose that the initial condition is with precision of a millionth, that is, assume that it can be anywhere from to . By the temporal evolution, at time this range of accuracy will be multiplied by ten and will have length , at instant length , and the instant length , but the latter is the length of the interval . Thus, after only instants of time, every point of could be describing the system. It is chaotic!\nWith more sophisticated mathematical tools, one sees that the temporal evolution of the “majority” (i.e., except in a set of “null length”) of initial conditions in this example behaves as above, whose orbit is dense in the range ; thus the ad hoc initial condition , in fact, is far from being an exception.\nThe examples above were defined in terms of a sequence of symbols (in this case ) associated with the decimal representation of real numbers, dynamics was postulated and the mechanism of dynamical chaos was apparent. It is interesting to note that with tools of current mathematical research, the chaotic behavior in some more sophisticated deterministic dynamical systems, modeling physical phenomena, can be visualized (this is usually not a simple task) in a way very similar to that described above. The basic principle is the same: existence of a region with (1) periodic orbits arbitrarily close to any initial condition, (2) the presence of dense orbits in the region, and (3) sensitivity to initial conditions. It is clear that the notion of visualization employed above should be given precisely, but the goal is to obtain dynamical properties based on symbols as illustrated above by the decimal representation.\nThere are several aspects of chaos that are not covered in this text, such as their links with fractals, noninteger dimensions and ergodic theory [2,6], but the goal here is not a detailed review of the subject and is strongly influenced by author’s preferences.\nIn some situations the presence of dynamical chaos is unfavorable: it can interfere with a good weather forecast, can be responsible for planetary instabilities, cause aerodynamic instabilities, among others. On the other hand, there are studies pointing to chaos as the mechanism responsible for the smooth running of various animal organs such as the heart and the brain. Thus, naturally one asks: how can chaotic features turn out to create some kind of stability responsible for the smooth running of something? And, particularly in the case of the brain, how is chaos is in charge of frequently produced original patterns? Certainly the situation is richer than predicting a floating leaf and there are still many applications to be detailed and understood.\nAcknowledgement: I thank Prof. Mário J. D.

Follow the driveway as it climbs steadily uphill. Before reaching the large iron gate outside the hotel itself, bear left as the road continues, then follow it through the outer edge of the hotel complex.\nAlso known as Darnhall and Back Barony, Barony Castle was originally a tower house that was extended in the 18th century to create the peculiar looking building that exists today. During the Second World War, the castle was used as a training facility for Polish officers and subsequently became a hotel which it remains to this day.\nShortly after the hotel, you’ll arrive at a junction near a large white structure known as the Gazebo with a path leading to your left. Take this, with the hotel now on your left across a steep gorge.\nWhen you’re directly opposite the hotel itself, pass through the bushes on your right to arrive at the Great Polish Map of Scotland. A path leads around its perimeter, and a viewing platform allows you to climb up high to look across the whole of Scotland.\nThe Great Polish Map of Scotland (NT 23650 47170) was built between 1975 and 1979. It was the creation of Polish soldier Jan Tomasik, who was stationed in the area during the Second World War as part of the 1st Polish Armoured Division charged with safeguarding the east coast. Rather than return to the Communist controlled Poland, Tomasik decided to remain in Scotland after the war and bought Barony Castle in the late 1960s.\nThe map was built at a scale of 1:10,000, but it isn’t an exact replica — instead, mountains were exaggerated to five times their actual heights in order to enhance its visual impact.\nThe map was all but lost when the hotel fell into disuse in the 1980s, but efforts to restore it began in 2010 and it now holds Category B listed status.\nWhen you’re finished at the map, retrace your steps back to the junction by the Gazebo. Join the main path again, and follow it as it winds to cross a stream. After passing a series of houses, the track climbs uphill once again.\nAfter rounding a sharp bend, you’ll reach a wooden five-bar gate to Black Barony Home Farm.

{"id": "6798", "text": "Here Comes Mr. Jordan (winner)\nHold Back the Dawn\nHow Green Was My Valley\nThe Little Foxes\nThe Maltese Falcon\nI don’t have a lot of complaints about this list of nominees. While I don’t love all of the movies, I don’t know that any of the five are shocking or terrible nominations. If I could add one, I might consider The Devil and Daniel Webster but that mostly comes from Walter Huston’s wonderful performance and not really from the screenplay. I Wake Up Screaming would be an interesting addition. High Sierra was also from this year, but I’m not convinced it’s a better choice than the five we already have.\nWeeding through the Nominees\n5. It’s very easy to hate on How Green Was My Valley when it won Best Picture over Citizen Kane and The Maltese Falcon. Putting its screenplay in fifth might feel like me doing exactly that. I don’t really hate the screenplay, though, and I’d have been shocked if it had not been nominated. I like the other screenplays we have here more, though. I don’t understand the acclaim for this one, and it’s not a screenplay that I love. I might put something in its place, but even then, this isn’t a terrible nomination.\n4. Winner Here Comes Mr. Jordan has as its greatest strength a plot that works in spite of itself. There are some real problems, though. The biggest problem I have with the film is that it doesn’t take long enough to really address all of its plot points. Too much is smashed into the sack and the sack is too small, so resolutions of problems don’t always work. I can get that people were enchanted by this and it does have its charms, but in a year with screenplays that take enough time to work everything out satisfactorily. Here Comes Mr. Jordan shouldn't be here.\n3. I like Hold Back the Dawn and I liked it more than I thought I would. It’s a Billy Wilder screenplay, and that generally means good things for the movie in question, but it’s also an earlier Billy Wilder screenplay. It ends up being pretty melodramatic. While I appreciate that it focuses on the idea of a romance rather than a romantic comedy, it also goes over the top in that respect. It’s a movie to watch more for the performances than for the story it tells. It’s not bad. In fact, it’s pretty good. It’s just not a winner.\n2. The Little Foxes is a film where I initially find the screenplay difficult to judge because of everything else the film has working for it. It contains a monster performance from Bette Davis, for instance, and some truly magnificent work behind the camera. If the film came with more of a resolution, I might like it a little bit more and allow it to contend for the statue, but it doesn’t quite get there. It’s a great screenplay, though, and one that I was happy to see nominated. In a film where pretty much everyone is kind of awful, that's pretty amazing.\n1. There are a few movies that I think are the template for film noir. The Maltese Falcon is one of those films. It is a near-perfect adaptation of the tense and muscular book and one that holds up now as a film. It’s smart, it all makes sense, and there’s not an ounce of filler here anywhere. This is a film that stays completely true to its source material, something that is in and of itself noteworthy. That it’s a great story and filmed within an inch of its life makes it all the better. I have no qualms about putting the statue in this direction.", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

{"id": "6883", "text": "Spotlight on Surveillance: October 2005\nRegistered Traveler Card: A Privatized Passenger ID\nThe federal government is spending an increasing amount of money on surveillance technology and programs at the expense of other projects. EPIC's \"Spotlight on Surveillance\" project scrutinizes these surveillance programs. For more information, see previous Spotlights on Surveillance.\nThis month, Spotlight focuses on the Transportation Security Administration's Registered Traveler program. The government pilot program began a year ago and recently ended at five airports; however, a private business is continuing the program at Orlando International Airport and there are plans to expand the air traveler prescreening program to many airports across the nation.1\nThe government has spent about $20 million on the pilot Registered Traveler program.2 The federal test program ended last month when Fiscal Year 2005 ended because no money has been allotted toward the program in the Fiscal Year 2006 budget.3 However, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) continues to conduct background checks on applicants and members of the private program, named Clear and operated by Verified Identity Pass Inc., at a cost of $30 to $50 per check, paid for by TSA.4\nFrom July 2005 (the beginning of the privately run Clear program at Orlando airport) to September 2005, about 8,600 people have joined Clear.5 The applicant, who must be a U.S. citizen or permanent foreign national, pays an annual fee of $79.95 to join.6 To apply, the applicant first completes a form that asks for biographical information including: previous home addresses for the past five years, Social Security number,7 Alien Registration Number and date of arrival in the United States (if applicable), and driver's license number.8 Once the applicant completes the form, he must go to a ClearSpace Enrollment Station (as of now, only located at Orlando International Airport). The applicant must bring two forms of identification, one of which must be a photo ID. The acceptable identification documents include unexpired U.S. passport; military, voter registration or Social Security cards; unexpired driver's license; or original or certified birth certificate.9 Clear then says that:\nWe carefully examine these documents for authenticity using the latest document inspection technology to detect tampering or counterfeiting. So that we have a complete record of your application, we store in a separate, secure database the biographical information and an image of the documents you submit to enroll.10\n|Applicants to the Clear Registered\nTraveler program must submit\nboth iris and fingerprint scans.\n[click to view full brochure in pdf]\nSource: Iridian Technologies\nThe applicant then submits digital images of his fingerprints and iris, and a digital photo. Clear then \"create[s] and store[s] a template, or mathematical representation, of the finger and iris images, to create a unique biometric ID of the Member.\"11 Then, all of the data submitted by the applicant is sent to TSA, which then creates the applicant's \"security threat assessment\" based upon a background check that includes its controversial \"no-fly lists.\"12 TSA continues to conduct security reviews of Clear members throughout their membership, and if a person's security threat assessment changes from approved to unapproved, the person is informed and their Clear membership discontinued.13 A rejected applicant cannot appeal this decision, and TSA will not disclose any information as to why the person was rejected.14\nSignificant privacy and security risks are inherent in this Registered Traveler program. First, there is a substantial security risk as the divides travelers into categories whose criteria can be learned and exploited. Second, there is a privacy risk because the program's members will not have the protections of the Privacy Act of 1974, as only government agencies are subject to the law. Third, the program has a risk of mission creep - a risk that information volunteered will be used for reasons not related to their original aviation security purposes.\nFirst, the program creates two classes of travelers: trusted and not trusted. But, as security expert Bruce Schneier has explained, this program also creates a third category: \"bad guys with the card.\"15 Criminals will choose applicants without previous links to terrorism, who can pass the background checks, to commit their crimes.16 (Schneier also has noted that, because Clear discontinues the membership of anyone who fails the continuous TSA security review, potential terrorists can pay $80 per year to \"be automatically notified if the Department of Homeland Security is onto him.\")17\nAirports that have joined the Registered Traveler Interoperability Consortium:\n* denotes a founding member\n|Source: Registered Traveler\nSecond, the private company would be in charge of verifying identity documents and maintaining a database full of personally identifiable data and images of the identity documents submitted by U.S. citizens and permanent foreign residents. The private company, unlike TSA and other federal government agencies, is not subject to the restrictions of the Privacy Act of 1974.18 When passing the Privacy Act, Congress sought to restrict amount of personal information that federal agencies could collect and required agencies to be transparent in their information practices.19 The members of the Clear Registered Traveler program would be subject to the private company's choice of what data to collect, how and where to store the data, and who has access to the data.\nThe information would not necessarily have stringent privacy protections when transmitted to TSA, however. TSA exempted the Registered Traveler records system from many protections the Privacy Act is intended to provide.20 TSA's notice leaves it under no legal obligation to inform the public of the categories of information contained in the system or provide the ability to access and correct records that are irrelevant, untimely or incomplete.\n\"Member[s] can request a copy of everything that Verified ID and its subcontractors have in their information systems files for the Clear Program identified to the Member personally, and Verified ID and its subcontractors will provide this information,\" according to the Clear program.21 However, TSA conducts a \"Security Threat Assessment\" of all applicants to determine if they can join the Clear program, and the reasons behind a positive or negative Security Threat Assessment are not communicated to applicants or the Clear program.22 Applicants cannot appeal such assessments by TSA.23\nThe lack of access and correction is especially troubling in light of the fact that documents recently obtained by EPIC under the Freedom of Information Act show nearly a hundred complaints from airline passengers between November 2003 and May 2004 about the government's traveler screening security measures.24 The most common complaint from travelers is that they have been wrongly placed on a government watch list.25 The Transportation Security Administration maintains \"selectee\" and \"no fly\" watch lists of individuals suspected of posing a risk to air travel safety. When a passenger checks in for a flight, he may be labeled a threat if his name matches an entry on one of the watch lists, even if he is not the person actually on the list. People who are identified as watch list matches may experience long screening delays or not be allowed to board the plane.\nTSA maintains that it has an adequate redress process to clear individuals improperly matched to watch lists; however, it is well known that individuals encounter difficulty in resolving such problems. Senators Ted Kennedy (D-MA) and Don Young (R-AK) are among the individuals who have been improperly flagged by watch lists.26 Sen. Kennedy was able to resolve the situation only by enlisting the help of then-Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge; unfortunately, most people do not have that option. A clear, timely, access and correction procedure is vital for the Clear Registered Traveler program. The watch-list complaints show that mistakes are made that significantly affect innocent Americans. As of now, Registered Traveler applicants who receive a negative Security Threat Assessment do not even have the redress process offered to those incorrectly matched to watch lists.TSA also has recently been criticized for its administration of the test passenger prescreening program, Secure Flight, which is similar to Registered Traveler. The agency began testing the Secure Flight system earlier this year. In June, however, TSA admitted that it had collected and maintained detailed commercial data about thousands of travelers in violation of a notice published last fall stating it would not do so.27 In July, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) concluded that these actions violated the Privacy Act.28 According to the GAO letter, \"the agency did not provide appropriate disclosure about its collection, use and storage of personal information as required by the Privacy Act,\" and \"[a]s a result of TSA's actions, the public did not receive the full protections\" of the law.29 Stringent privacy protections are necessary, and it has been shown that travelers' rights are not secure even when the program is administered by a federal agency subject to privacy laws. The privacy rights of travelers would receive far less legal protection under a program administered by a private company not subject to the Privacy Act of 1974.\nA third risk associated with the Clear and federal Registered Traveler program is that of mission creep. Program applicants must submit a substantial amount of personally identifiable information that Clear keeps - including biometric data and digital images of identity documents, such as birth certificates, Social Security cards, and driver's licenses. It is possible for Clear program members to be tracked, because Clear \"will maintain 'log files' of entrances to local venues.\"30 The company states that it keeps the log files only at the local venue and these files are automatically purged every 24-48 hours.31 However, the possibility for easily tracking travelers is there, and it would be tempting to use the excuse that \"homeland security\" and \"terrorism prevention\" demand that such tracking be done.\nIn the past, TSA has exhibited a proclivity for using personal information for reasons other than the ones for which the information was gathered or volunteered. Though TSA has stated that it will not use the sensitive personal data of tens of millions of Americans for non-aviation security purposes, TSA documents about another passenger prescreening program similar to Registered Traveler, the CAPPS II program, collected by EPIC under the FOIA clearly show that TSA had considered using personal information gathered for CAPPS II for reasons beyond its original purposes. For example, TSA stated that CAPPS II personal data might be disclosed to federal, state, local, foreign, or international agencies for their investigations of statute, rule, regulation or order violations.32\nIn the case of Registered Traveler, TSA has identified thirteen categories of \"routine uses\" of personal information that will be collected and maintained in the program's system of records. In one category, TSA anticipates disclosure to \"the appropriate Federal, State, local, tribal, territorial, foreign or international agency responsible for investigating, prosecuting, enforcing, or implementing a statute, rule, regulation, or order, where TSA becomes aware of an indication of a violation or potential violation of civil or criminal law or regulation.\"33 This category is so broad as to be almost meaningless, allowing for potential disclosure to virtually any government agency worldwide for a vast array of actual or \"potential\" undefined violations.\nBeyond the above mission creep possibilities, there are the comments made by Steven Brill, who runs the Clear program's parent company Verified Identity Pass Inc. Brill has said that he envisions the Clear card becoming more than just an aviation security ID card. Brill's company has partnered with rental car company Hertz and online travel booking company Orbitz to market the Clear program cards, and is expected to announce a partnership with an airline soon.34 Brill has said that he hopes the Clear ID card would also be used at office buildings, power plants and stadiums.35 The development of such an unregulated ID system has significant implications for Americans. Entry into an office building or stadium should not be conditioned upon whether the person can afford a privatized ID card.\n1 The pilot program was launched by the Transportation Security Administration at six airports in Boston, Houston, Los Angeles, Minneapolis, and Washington, DC. To date the only privately run Registered Traveler program is at Orlando International Airport, but the Registered Traveler Interoperability Consortium hopes to deploy private Registered Traveler programs at 50 airports around the nation.

{"id": "6905", "text": "Monthly Doctor’s Blog: Intestinal Parasites\nEvery month, the doctors of AtlasVet write a blog post to help pet owners with common questions\nThis month, Dr. Brittany Cartlidge answers common questions about Intestinal Parasites!\nI see worms in my pet’s stool, what do I do?\nThere are two kinds of worms that you can see with the naked eye in the stool, tapeworms and roundworms. Tapeworms look like grains of white rice and roundworms look like spaghetti (Sorry for the food analogies everyone). An additional gross fact is that roundworms can be seen in vomitus. Contact your veterinarian’s office if you see visible worms as they may recommend bringing in a fecal sample for testing (as different treatment protocols are done based on what parasite is present) and/or prescribe deworming medications.\nWhy did the fecal test come back negative if I saw actual worms in the stool?\nThis happens with tapeworms because the eggs and tapeworm segments are heavy and fall out of solution when the fecal material is diluted and examined under a microscope. Direct visual examination of the stool is usually sufficient for diagnosis. Dogs and cats get tapeworms from eating a flea. Treatment of both the tapeworms and fleas is recommended to get rid of the issue.\nMy pet does not eat poop. So how could they have gotten worms?\nDogs and cats can pick up intestinal parasites from grooming their fur that has microscopic eggs or cysts from the soil (that was contaminated with stool). They can also pick something up from grooming another animals perianal area or drinking water that has Giardia cysts in it. Predation (eating mice/rats/birds) is another possible route. Lastly, young puppies and kittens can be infected from their mother.\nHow can my pet have intestinal parasites if their stool is normal? (ie no diarrhea)\nThere are several factors at play to determine if an intestinal parasite will cause observable signs of disease including the worm burden (amount of the parasite present), any underlying medical issues your pet may have, their age and their individual metabolism. The parasite itself also makes a difference. For example, tapeworms rarely cause diarrhea. Coccidia and Giardia can be found incidentally on routine fecal tests as well.\nMy vet said my pet tested positive for giardia. What is giardia?\nGiardia is one of the most common intestinal parasites in DC. It is a protozoal parasite that is only visible microscopically. The really annoying thing about Giardia is that it can exist in a cyst form which allows it to live outside the host, contaminating the environment and waiting to infect another host. Contaminated water is a common source of Giardia infection but pets can also get Giardia by ingesting the cysts while grooming their haircoat.\nAre human family members at risk if one of our pets has intestinal parasites? What about other pets?\nTransmission to a person is extremely unlikely but not impossible. A person would need to eat a flea to get infected with the same species of tapeworm that dogs and cats get. People can get Giardia but it is uncommon for them to get it from their dog or cat. Young children can be infected with roundworms if they ingest the affected pet’s fecal material or material contaminated with fecal material. Hookworms can penetrate the skin of humans and cause a condition called cutaneous larval migrans, which causes really itchy skin lesions. Prevention for humans can includes covering your skin with shoes and gloves while gardening and covering children’s sandboxes when not in use to prevent fecal contamination from roaming cats.\nAs to the other pets in the home, it depends on the species of the pet, what parasite the pet is infected with and what level of interaction they have at home. Ask your veterinarian for further guidance about treating your other pets if one of your pets is diagnosed with an intestinal parasite.\nWhat about heartworms? Can this be picked up on a fecal sample?\nHeartworms are not an intestinal parasite and your veterinarian needs a blood sample to test for heartworms. Dogs (and much less commonly, cats) are infected with baby heartworms (called microfilaria) from a mosquito bite and as the worms mature, they infect the lungs and heart. Heartworm disease is a serious, life threatening infection, so monthly, year round heartworm prevention is advised for dogs and cats who go outside.\nWhat else should I know about intestinal parasites?\nIntestinal parasitism is very common and usually not serious so don’t panic. Make sure to pick up your dog’s poop to lessen contamination of the environment in DC. Heartworm and flea preventions also prevent some, but not all, intestinal parasites so follow your veterinarian’s guidance about what they recommend for your pet to keep them parasite free.", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}

{"id": "6923", "text": "A hormone can be defined as a substance secreted by an endocrine gland that is transported in the blood, thereby regulating the function of another tissue(s). Certain hormones, such as growth hormone (GH, secreted from the anterior pituitary gland), thyroxine (T4, from the thyroid gland) and insulin (from the pancreatic islet cells), influence tissue metabolism directly. Conversely, trophic hormones from the pituitary gland stimulate target endocrine glands to synthesize and secrete further hormones, which in turn partly control trophic hormone release, usually by negative feedback inhibition. For example, hypercalcaemia inhibits the secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH), and elevation of plasma T4 concentration inhibits the secretion of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH).\nEndocrine glands may secrete excessive or deficient amounts of hormone. Abnormalities of target glands may be primary or secondary to dysfunction of the controlling mechanism, usually located in the hypothalamus or anterior pituitary gland.\nHormone secretion may vary predictably over a 24-h (circadian) or longer period. It may be episodic or may respond predictably to physiological stimuli such as stress. Simultaneous measurement of both the trophic hormones and their controlling factors, whether hormones or metabolic products, may be more informative than the measurement of either alone. An important endocrine principle is that an apparently ‘normal’ hormone result should be interpreted in the context of the associated hormone axis, for example a plasma PTH concentration within the reference range may be abnormal if the plasma calcium concentration is elevated.\nIt is also important to know about the assay’s performance, as sometimes heterophilic interfering antibodies may cross-react with various hormones, as can certain immunoglobulins, for example macroprolactin (see Chapter 9, Hyperprolactinaemia).\nIf the results of preliminary tests are definitely abnormal, this may be primary or secondary to a disorder of one of the controlling mechanisms. Should the results be equivocal when considered together with the clinical findings, so-called ‘dynamic’ tests should be carried out. In such tests the response of the gland or the feedback mechanism is assessed after stimulation or suppression by the administration of exogenous hormone.\nSuppression tests are used mainly for the differential diagnosis of excessive hormone secretion. The substance (or an analogue) that normally suppresses secretion by negative feedback is administered and the response is measured. Failure to suppress implies that secretion is not under normal feedback control (autonomous secretion).\nStimulation tests are used mainly for the differential diagnosis of deficient hormone secretion. The trophic hormone that normally stimulates secretion is administered and the response is measured. A normal response excludes an abnormality of the target gland, whereas failure to respond confirms it.\nDisorders of the pituitary gland and hypothalamus are discussed in this chapter. Diseases of the target endocrine organs, the adrenal cortex, gonads and thyroid gland, are considered in Chapters 8, 9 and 11 respectively. The parathyroid glands and endocrine pancreas are discussed in Chapters 6 and 12 respectively.\nHYPOTHALAMUS AND PITUITARY GLAND\nThe anterior and posterior lobes of the pituitary gland are developmentally and functionally distinct; both depend on hormones synthesized in the hypothalamus for normal function. The hypothalamus also has extensive neural connections with the rest of the brain, and stress and some psychological disorders affect the secretion of pituitary hormones and of the hormones from other endocrine glands; see also Chapter 9.\nControl of posterior pituitary hormones\nTwo structurally similar peptide hormones, antidiuretic hormone (ADH) – also called vasopressin or arginine vasopressin (AVP) – and oxytocin, are synthesized in the hypothalamus and transported down the nerve fibres of the pituitary stalk attached to specific carrier proteins – neurophysins. The hormones are stored in the posterior pituitary gland and are released independently of each other into the bloodstream under hypothalamic control, together with neurophysin. Neurophysin has no apparent biological function and is rapidly cleared from plasma.\nAntidiuretic hormone (arginine vasopressin) is mainly synthesized in the supraoptic nuclei of the hypothalamus and enhances water reabsorption from the collecting ducts in the kidneys (see Chapters 2 and 3).\nOxytocin is synthesized in the paraventricular nuclei of the hypothalamus. It controls the ejection of milk from the lactating breast and may have a role in initiating uterine contractions, although normal labour can proceed in its absence. It may be used therapeutically to induce labour.\nAnterior pituitary hormones\nThere is no direct neural connection between the hypothalamus and the anterior pituitary gland. The hypothalamus synthesizes small molecules (regulating hormones or factors) that are carried to the cells of the anterior pituitary lobe by the hypothalamic portal system. This network of capillary loops in the median eminence forms veins, which, after passing down the pituitary stalk, divide into a second capillary network in the anterior pituitary gland, from where hypothalamic hormones stimulate or inhibit pituitary hormone secretion into the systemic circulation.\nThe cells of the anterior pituitary lobe can be classified simply by their staining reactions as acidophils, basophils or chromophobes. Immunohistochemistry can identify specific hormone-secreting cells.\nThese hormones, which are simple polypeptides with similar amino acid sequences, mainly affect peripheral tissues directly. Stimulation and inhibition of secretion via the hypothalamus is influenced by neural stimuli.\nBasophils secrete hormones that affect other endocrine glands. The hypothalamic control is mainly stimulatory. There are three cell types:\nCorticotrophs synthesize a large polypeptide (pro-opiomelanocortin), which is a precursor of both adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH; corticotrophin) and β-lipotrophin (Fig. 7.1). Secretion of these hormones occurs in parallel.\nAdrenocorticotrophic hormone stimulates the synthesis and secretion of steroids, other than aldosterone, from the adrenal cortex and maintains adrenal cortical growth. Part of the molecule has melanocyte-stimulating activity, and high circulating concentrations of ACTH are often associated with pigmentation.\nβ-Lipotrophin is inactive until rapidly converted to endorphins. These are neurotransmitters which, because they have opiate-like effects, help control pain.\nGonadotrophs secrete the gonadotrophins, folliclestimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH), which act on the gonads.\nThyrotrophs secrete TSH (thyrotrophin), which acts on the thyroid gland.\nThese hormones are structurally similar glycoproteins consisting of two subunits, α and β. The α-subunit is common to all three hormones; the β-subunit is important for receptor recognition and therefore in specific biological activity.\nChromophobes, once thought to be inactive, do contain secretory granules. Chromophobe adenomas often secrete hormones, particularly prolactin.\nControl of anterior pituitary hormone secretion\nNeural and feedback controls are the two most important physiological factors influencing the secretion of the anterior pituitary hormones (Fig. 7.2).\nFigure 7.1 The products of pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC): adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH), β-lipotrophin (LPH), γ-LPH, β-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH) and β- and γ-endorphin. The numbers indicate the amino acid sequence in POMC.\nFigure 7.2 Control of pituitary hormone secretion.\nExtrahypothalamic neural stimuli modify, and at times over-ride, other control mechanisms. Physical or emotional stress and mental illness may give similar findings to, and even precipitate, endocrine disease. The stress caused by insulin-induced hypoglycaemia is used to test anterior pituitary function. Stress may also stimulate the secretion of ADH from the posterior pituitary.\nFeedback control is mediated by the concentrations of circulating target-cell hormones; a rising concentration usually suppresses trophic hormone secretion. This negative feedback may directly suppress hypothalamic hormone secretion or may modify its effect on pituitary cells (long feedback loop). The secretion of hypothalamic hormones may also be suppressed by rising concentrations of pituitary hormone in a short feedback loop.\nInherent rhythms: hypothalamic, and consequently pituitary, hormones are released intermittently, either in pulses or in a regular circadian rhythm. Disturbances of such rhythms may be of diagnostic value. This subject is considered further in the relevant sections.\nDrugs may also stimulate or block the action of neurotransmitters, such as catecholamines, acetylcholine and serotonin, and influence the secretion of hypothalamic, and consequently pituitary, hormones. The following are some examples.\nCertain neuroleptic drugs, such as chlorpromazine and haloperidol, interfere with the action of dopamine. This results in reduced GH secretion (reduced effect of releasing factor) and increased prolactin secretion (reduced inhibition).\nBromocriptine, which has a dopamine-like action, and levodopa, which is converted to dopamine, have the opposite effect in normal subjects. Bromocriptine causes a paradoxical suppression of excessive GH secretion in acromegalics; the reason for this anomalous response is unknown.\nAll these effects have been used in both the diagnosis and treatment of hypothalamic-pituitary disorders; they are discussed in later sections.\nEvaluation of anterior pituitary function\nThe interpretation of the results of basal pituitary hormone assays is often difficult. Low plasma concentrations are not necessarily abnormal, and plasma concentrations within the reference range do not exclude pituitary disease. The diagnosis of suspected hypopituitarism is best excluded by the direct measurement of pituitary hormones after stimulation or by demonstrating target gland hyposecretion after the administration of the relevant trophic hormone. However, prolonged hypopituitarism may result in secondary failure of the target gland with diminished response to stimulation.\nLaboratory tests establish only the presence or absence of hypopituitarism, and the cause must be sought by other clinical means such as radiological imaging (see also Chapter 9).\nHypothalamus or pituitary dysfunction?\nIt may be difficult to distinguish between hypothalamic and pituitary causes of pituitary hormone deficiency or, more correctly, between deficient releasing factor and a primary deficiency of pituitary hormone secretion. Isolated hormone deficiencies are more likely to be of hypothalamic than of pituitary origin. The coexistence of diabetes insipidus suggests a hypothalamic disorder.\nSome biochemical investigations evaluate both hypothalamic and pituitary function and some only the latter, although it may be possible to distinguish the anatomical site of the lesion. For example, the TSH response to thyrotrophin-releasing hormone (TRH) may differ in hypothalamic and pituitary causes of secondary hypothyroidism (see Chapter 11). In cases of hypogonadism due to gonadotrophin deficiency, differentiation on the basis of the response to gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) is less clear cut (see Chapter 9).\nDISORDERS OF ANTERIOR PITUITARY HORMONE SECRETION\nThe main clinical syndromes associated with excessive or deficient anterior pituitary hormone secretion are shown in Table 7.1. Excessive secretion usually involves a single hormone, but deficiencies are often multiple. However, many pituitary tumours are non-secretory and may present clinically with eye signs or headaches.\nGrowth hormone secretion from the anterior pituitary gland is mainly controlled by hypothalamic GH-releasing hormone (GHRH). After synthesis by the hypothalamus, this is transported via the hypothalamic portal system to the somatotrophs of the anterior pituitary. Secretion of GHRH, and therefore of GH, is pulsatile, occurring about seven or eight times a day, usually associated with:\nonset of deep sleep,\nin response to the falling plasma glucose concentration about an hour after meals.\nAt other times, plasma concentrations are usually very low or undetectable, especially in children.\nGrowth hormone release is inhibited in a negative feedback pathway by another hypothalamic hormone, somatostatin (GH-release inhibiting hormone). Somatostatin is found not only in the hypothalamus and elsewhere in the brain, but also in the gastrointestinal tract and pancreatic islet cells, where it inhibits the secretion of many gastrointestinal hormones. Insulinlike growth factor 1 (IGF-1) acts by feedback to inhibit GHRH action.\nTable 7.1 Disorders associated with primary abnormalities of anterior pituitary hormone secretion\nAcromegaly or gigantism\nAmenorrhoea Infertility Galactorrhoea Osteopenia\nAdrenocorticotrophic hormone (corticotrophin)\nSecondary adrenal hypofunction\nHyperthyroidism (very rare)\nLuteinizing hormone/follicle-stimulating hormone\nSecondary hypogonadism Infertility\nGrowth hormone secretion may be stimulated by:\nstress, one cause of which is hypoglycaemia,\nsome amino acids, for example arginine,\ndrugs such as levodopa and clonidine.\nAll these stimuli have been used to assess GH secretory capacity, which may also be impaired in obese patients, in hypothyroidism and hypogonadism, in some cases of Cushing’s syndrome and in patients receiving large doses of steroids.\nActions of growth hormone\nThe main function of GH is to promote growth. Its action is primarily mediated by IGFs, polypeptides that are synthesized in many tissues, where they act locally. Plasma concentrations of one of these, IGF-1 (also known as somatomedin C), correlate with GH secretion.\nCarbohydrate metabolism is affected by GH: GH antagonizes the insulin-mediated cell uptake of glucose, and excess secretion may produce glucose intolerance.\nFat metabolism is stimulated by GH: lipolysis is stimulated, with a consequent increase in the concentration of circulating free fatty acids. Free fatty acid antagonizes insulin release and action. Growth hormone enhances protein synthesis, in conjunction with insulin, to stimulate amino acid uptake by cells.\nThe production of IGF-1 is also influenced by other factors, the most important of which is nutritional status. In undernutrition, plasma concentrations are low, whereas GH concentrations are elevated, suggesting that plasma IGF-1 may influence GH secretion by negative feedback. Other factors, such as adequate nutrition and T4, are also needed for normal growth. The growth spurt during puberty may be enhanced by androgens.\nGrowth hormone excess: gigantism and acromegaly\nGrowth hormone excess causes gigantism during childhood and acromegaly in adults.\nMost patients with GH excess have acidophil adenomas of the anterior pituitary gland, which may be secondary to excessive hypothalamic stimulation. Rarely, malignant tumours may release GH or GHRH. Acromegaly is sometimes one of the manifestations of multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN).\nThe clinical manifestations of GH excess depend on whether the condition develops before or after fusion of the bony epiphyses. Gigantism is caused by excess GH secretion in childhood before fusion of the epiphyseal plates, which may be delayed by accompanying hypogonadism. Heights of up to about 2 metres may be reached. Acromegalic features may develop after bony fusion, but these patients may die in early adult life from infection or cardiac failure or as a consequence of progressive pituitary tumour growth. The features of acromegaly may include the following (Fig. 7.3):\nAn increase in the bulk of bone and soft tissues with enlargement of, for example, the hands, tongue, jaw and heart. Changes in facial appearance are often marked, due to the increasing size of the jaw and sinuses; the gradual coarsening of the features may pass unnoticed for many years. Thyroid gland enlargement may be clinically detectable, but the patient is usually euthyroid.\nExcessive hair growth, hyperhidrosis and sebaceous gland secretion are common.\nMenstrual disturbances are common in females.\nImpaired glucose tolerance is present in about 25 per cent of patients, about half of whom develop symptomatic diabetes mellitus. In most cases the pancreas can secrete enough insulin to overcome the antagonistic effect of GH.\nFigure 7.3 Patient with acromegaly; note large hands and prominent mandible and supraorbital ridges.

London: Hodder Arnold, 1995.\nThere is a predisposition to multiple pre-malignant colon polyposis and hypertension.\nHyperphosphataemia, hypercalcaemia and hypertriglyceridaemia may also be present.\nMany of these features are due to the action of IGF-1, which acts as a general growth factor.", "scores": {"score": 4, "score_transform_1": 5, "score_transform_2": 5, "score_transform_3": 0}}

{"id": "6956", "text": "Are you finally ready to invest in your dream home? If you're exploring different types of houses to buy, you may wonder what the difference is between modular and mobile homes. Although the two options are similar, there are some key differences that you'll want to be aware of before making an informed decision.\nIf you want to create your ideal version of a home, Carolina Custom Homes is here to help. With this guide, we hope to provide some clarity on modular homes vs. mobile homes so that you can decide which option is best for your needs.\nHere's a quick overview of each type of home to help you decide which one is right for you:\nModular Home Vs. Mobile Home—What's the Difference?\nLet's take a look at the difference between a mobile home and a modular home. When you learn the definitions, they start to look quite different to the homebuyer.\nWhat Is a Modular Home?\nA modular home is a type of home built in sections in a factory setting. Once the sections are complete, they're transported to the building site and assembled by qualified professionals. Although modular homes are constructed in a factory setting, they must still adhere to the local building code requirements.\nModular homes offer several benefits, such as:\n- Increased flexibility: Modular homes can be customized to your specific needs and preferences. You'll have the opportunity to choose your floor plan, layout, fixtures, and finishes.\n- Shorter build time: Because modular homes are built in a controlled factory setting, the construction process is often faster than traditional homebuilding.\n- Greater quality control: With modular homes, you can be confident that your home is built to exacting standards. In a factory setting, construction crews have access to better tools and materials, which results in a higher-quality finished product.\nWhen assessing a modular home vs. mobile home, it's essential to keep in mind that modular homes are built to the same code requirements as traditional site-built homes. If you're looking to move in soon, modular homes are an excellent option.\nWhat Is a Mobile Home?\nAlthough modular homes are referred to frequently as \"mobile homes\" in the modern day, there's actually an important distinction between a modular home vs. mobile home. A mobile home refers explicitly to a \"mobile home\" or \"trailer\" that was built before 1976. In 1976, the HUD Code was enacted, which created standards for the construction, transportation, and the sale of mobile homes.\nBefore the HUD code, there were few guidelines or oversight regarding mobile homes. The main requirement was their movability. However, modular homes must now comply with the HUD Code, meaning they're subject to regular inspections and must meet specific safety standards.\nMobile homes built after the HUD Code's enactment are referred to as \"manufactured homes.\" Manufactured homes must be built according to the federal building code, which includes specific requirements for the following:\n- Foundation: The home must be built on a permanent foundation that meets local building code requirements.\n- Permits and inspections: The home must comply with all local zoning regulations, including obtaining the proper permits.\n- Transportation: The home must be transported by a certified installer.\n- Installation: The home must be installed by a certified professional.\n- Construction and Design: The modular home must be constructed to the federal building code and meet specific design requirements.\n- Energy Efficiency: The modular home must meet specific energy efficiency standards.\n- Plumbing and Electrical work: The modular home must have a certified plumbing and electrical system that meets all local standards.\n- Fire Safety: The modular home must have a fire safety system to help alert and protect the buyer from harm.\nIf you're considering purchasing a modular home or manufactured home, Carolina Custom Homes is ready to assist. We have ample experience in the modular home industry, and we can help you find the perfect home to suit your needs. When it comes to modular homes vs. mobile homes, we can help you make the best decision for your family. Are you wondering how to prepare yourself for building a house? Check out our free resource for more information!\n10 Benefits of Choosing a Present-Day Manufactured Home\nThe modular home vs. site-built debate has been around for decades, with both sides making valid points. However, there are some critical differences between the two types of homes that present-day manufactured homeowners should be aware of. Here are 10 benefits of choosing a present-day manufactured home:\n- Cost: Manufactured homes are often more affordable than site-built homes, especially when you factor in land cost.\n- Energy Efficiency: Today's manufactured homes are built with energy-efficient materials and appliances, saving you money on utility bills.\n- Customization: Modular homes offer a wide range of customization options, from the floor plan to the fixtures and finishes.\n- Quick Construction: Manufactured homes are constructed in a controlled environment, which means they can be built quickly and efficiently.\n- Quality Control: Modular homes are subject to strict quality control standards, ensuring that your home meets all local building codes.\n- Flexibility: They can be designed to fit any lot size or setback, making them an excellent option for difficult-to-build sites.\n- Resale Value: Modular homes have proven to hold their value over time, making them a wise investment.\n- Sustainability: These homes are often made with recycled materials and are built to be energy-efficient, making them more sustainable than traditional site-built homes.\n- Disaster Resistant: Modular homes are constructed to withstand high winds and other severe weather conditions, making them a smart choice for disaster-prone areas.\n- Peace of Mind: When you choose a modular home, you can rest assured knowing that your home has been built to the highest standards.\nIf you're considering a manufactured home, keep these 10 benefits in mind. With today's modern modular homes, you can have all the advantages of a site-built home without the incredibly high price tag. Plus, you can customize your home any way you please.\nThe Verdict: Modular Home Vs. Mobile Home\nSo, what's the difference between modular homes and mobile homes? It all comes down to when the home was built and whether or not it meets the HUD Code requirements. Modular homes are made to the same standards as site-built homes, meaning they must meet local building codes and be constructed by a certified professional.\nOn the other hand, mobile homes are not subject to the same standards and can be moved from one location to another. Although they were popular in the early 1900s, building standards have drastically changed since the 1970s. And when you're making one of the most important purchases of your life, you want to be sure you're getting a beautifully built home that will last.\nIf you're looking for a quality home that stands the test of time, modular homes are the way to go. With modular homes, you'll get all the benefits of a traditional home with customization options and more control over the price tag. And, with modular homes, you can rest assured knowing your home was built to the highest standards.\nIf you're interested in purchasing a manufactured home, Carolina Custom Homes can help you find the perfect one for your needs. With our experience in the modular home industry, we can help you navigate the process and make the best decision for your family.\nStill have questions about modular homes vs. mobile homes?

{"id": "6968", "text": "Food insecurity is a problem that many college students across the country face—it can be difficult to focus on education for those who are unsure how they will afford their next meal. Over the last few years, Millersville University has taken steps toward alleviating food insecurity on campus.\nTwo recent endowments made by alumni are targeted toward food insecurity. One of these donations created the Seaber Athletic Meal Support Fund, founded by alumna Kathryn Seaber ’76. This endowment was created to help student-athletes through partial or complete meal plan funding.\nAnother award, the Murley Meal Plan Support Scholarship Endowment, was donated by alumna Karen Murley ’63. This scholarship is meant to provide the recipients, students in good academic standing with demonstrated financial need, with a meal plan for both the fall and spring semesters.\nHunger-Free Campus Initiative\nPennsylvania’s First Lady Frances Wolf and acting Secretary of Education Eric Hagarty visited Millersville in August to announce the Hunger-Free Campus Initiative. This grant program is designed to help students at risk of hunger access free, healthy food on college campuses across Pennsylvania.\nMany students have relied on free meals throughout their lives, but college students do not often have access to the same assistance provided by their grade schools and secondary schools. The Hunger-Free Campus Initiative seeks to help students financially as they balance the costs of housing, tuition, textbooks and more.\nThe initiative focuses on building a coalition of colleges and universities across the state in order to provide resources for campuses and support opportunities to apply for grants related to addressing food insecurity. Universities in the coalition will work to address student hunger and other basic needs.\nMillersville University has been designated as a PA Hunger-Free Campus. That means the University will have access to the PA Hunger-Free Campus grant program. One million dollars of the 2022-23 state budget will be applied to this program, which will also help schools enhance food pantries and increase Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program outreach.\nThe Food Recovery Network at MU is a student-run organization which, under the advisement of Dr. Jennifer Frank, has helped to eliminate food waste and food insecurity on campus since its inception in 2017. The club currently collects food and other prepackaged snacks that students donate from the Cove, and then gives that food to the Campus Cupboard, located in the HUB. Over the past five years, FRN has collected and donated 1,870 pounds of food.\n“The FRN is a local chapter of a national organization and movement,” explains Frank. “FRN’s mission is to eliminate waste and feed people! I love that dual goal. It is a shame that there is so much food waste, especially when there are so many hungry people. We need to be more creative and figure out ways to do both.”\nAs for the Campus Cupboard, the HUB’s new director, Jacob Marino, plans to continue the food pantry. Here, students can shop for groceries at no cost, including frozen meals, dry and canned goods, specialty items and hygiene products.\nThe HUB has always been a place of service on campus, and Marino plans to continue the tradition. Free meals are served to the Millersville community every Tuesday, Thursday and Friday. Grab-and-go breakfast items are available in the HUB café every morning, where an assortment of snacks can often be found as well.\nThe University also encourages the use of Share Meals, a free app that helps students locate free food on campus. By creating an account with their Millersville email address, students are automatically enrolled in the Millersville community and can get notifications whenever an event with free meals occurs. Students can also use the app to indicate that they would like to share their dining funds with another student. This not only eliminates hunger but also allows students to create new friendships by sharing a meal together.\nAdditionally, a new orchard on campus will begin to produce fruit in about three to five years. The biology department is partnering with the HUB, and some of this fresh produce will be donated to the Campus Cupboard.\n“This is a serious issue for many reasons,” says Frank. “Hunger and food insecurity affect our health, our academics and our overall well-being.”\n“A study we conducted in 2019, which is now published in the ‘Journal of Poverty,’ found 36.5% of our students had low or very low food security,” she concludes. “It is so important to focus on food security because this issue affects more students than you might think.”", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}
{"id": "6975", "text": "How To Throw An Easy Cocktail Party\nCocktail parties were a popular social gathering fueled by Prohibition in the first few decades of the 1900s and all but ended during the last part of the century. However, they are back and better than ever!\nSo, how do you throw a cocktail party? It’s an easy party to plan!\nHere’s a guide to get you on your way.\nCocktail Party Invitation\nA beautiful invitation is great, but keep in mind that guests appreciate the convenience of an electronic RSVP. So, if you choose to send an invitation via mail, an additional email will help in securing timely RSVP’s.\nGreetings Island has a variety of beautifully designed invitations that can be downloaded, mailed, or emailed.\nWhat Time Should A Cocktail Party Start?\nThe typical time to host a cocktail party is between 6 to 8 pm. Cocktail parties generally last for only about 2-3 hours. By providing an end time, your guests can make plans afterwards and you won’t be left with a guest who overstays their welcome.\nCocktail Party Essentials\nThe food served at a cocktail depends on:\n• Theme (if chosen)\n• Number of guests\n• If dinner will be served\nAs you plan the menu, aim for variety and plan on serving roughly 6 bites per person, per hour if dinner will not be served.\nHere are a few important tips to keep in mind when planning the drink menu:\n• The season (Fall, Winter, Spring, Summer)\n• Theme (e.g. Southern Cocktails & Bites)\n• Number of guests\n• Cocktails you will be offering\nIt’s not a bad idea to also have beer and wine stocked for your guests. Once the details have been ironed out then it’s simply a game of numbers.\nHow Many Drinks Per Guest?\nThe general guideline is that guests will consume 2 drinks the first hour and 1 drink per hour after that. However, you know your guests best, if this doesn’t seem to be enough then adjust accordingly.\nFor instance, if you have 7 guests attending for 3 hours and are hosting a 1920’s theme party that will be serving gin and tonic, you need enough drink ingredients for 28 gin and tonics.\nSend your guest home with a party favor that has them raving about how great of a host or hostess you are. A great way to do this is with pre-packaged food, such as cookies or a locally made chocolate. These small treats will fit perfectly in a decorative box that adds a special touch.\nThrowing a cocktail party is an easy and fun party to plan that brings together friends for a good time. In the end, that is all that matters!", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

The same is true with blog readers. You have to publish new posts with fresh content occasionally; maybe not daily, but often enough to keep readers interested enough to come back.\nIf one bird finds your feeder and likes it, somehow they seem to get the word out to other birds and soon you have more than one bird coming to your feeder. If one reader finds your blog and likes it, they’ll likely tell someone else about it and soon you’ll have several readers visit your blog each day.\nBirds don’t like to have their pictures taken and will fly away if you get too aggressive in trying to figure out who they are. Most days, you won’t know who visited your bird feeder; you just hope they found something they liked there.\nLikewise, some blog readers don’t like to be seen or make their presence known with a comment; they just want to enjoy the post and then move on to the next one. Most days you won’t know who came by and read your blog, but you hope they enjoyed whatever you posted.\nHere are some of the visitors who came to my bird feeder today.\nThis little bird had the feeder all to himself.\nA female cardinal (one of the few birds I can identify) came around and another bird is patiently waiting for an ‘open seat’.\nThe female cardinal must have told the male cardinal about the menu change, and he came to see if the seed was as good as she said it was.\nWow, word must be getting around about the new menu at Chez May Dreams Gardens.\nAnd now I wonder who came and visited my blog today?

In 2015, Zimplats produced just 190 000 ounces of the metal, which is mainly used to curb emissions from vehicles and as jewelry.\nThe government wants to use the land to build a 600-megawatt power plant, which it says will earn the state $3bn a year. There will also be “numerous” other benefits to the economy, it said. The economy has halved in size since 2000.\nZimplats, which is 87% owned by Impala, has opposed the government’s request, saying the land isn’t surplus to requirements. The company handed over about a third of its mineral rights to the state a decade ago in exchange for cash and credits toward Zimbabwe’s indigenisation rules, which require foreign-owned companies to be part owned by local black investors.\n“We’ve been talking to the government about this issue for some time and those talks are continuing,” said Johan Theron, a spokesperson for Impala. “There’s a little piece of land between where we’re mining and what’s been released. They have an interest in acquiring more of that land.”\nPresident Robert Mugabe’s administration has faced mounting public unrest as a cash shortage undermined the government’s ability to pay its workers and consumers’ access to funds to pay their bills. The country implemented a multi-currency system in 2009 after its economy collapsed in the wake of a campaign to seize white-owned commercial farms and hand them over to black subsistence farmers, slashing export income.\nZimplats lodged an objection to the proposed purchase as far back as March 2013.", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

Many analysts are optimistic about silver prices in the near future, as the global economy is expected to improve and the demand for silver is expected to remain strong. Additionally, rising industrial demand could contribute to an increase in silver prices.\nAre there any risks associated with investing in silver?\nYes, there are risks associated with investing in silver. Like all investments, silver prices can be volatile. Additionally, the price of silver is largely driven by the demand for metal and the state of the global economy, so any changes or economic uncertainty could affect silver prices. It is important for investors to be aware of these risks before investing in silver.\nThe silver market is an ever-evolving and complex entity, and it can be difficult to predict the direction of its performance. However, with its historically low cost per ounce and its increasing industrial demand, silver may be on the cusp of a boom. Investing in silver can be a great move for those looking to diversify and capitalize on potential long-term gains, so it may be worth considering as a potential option. With the right research and preparation, silver can be a valuable asset in any portfolio.\nAndrew Terry is a highly respected economist, who received their graduate education at Harvard University.

{"id": "7204", "text": "Concentration and source changes of HONO during the COVID-19 lockdown in Beijing\nAbstract. Nitrous acid (HONO) is an important precursor of OH radicals which affects not only the sinks of primary air pollutants but also the formation of secondary air pollutants, whereas its source closure in the atmosphere is still controversial due to a lack of experiment validation. In this study, the HONO budget in Beijing has been analyzed and validated through the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) lockdown event, which resulted in the largest changes in air pollutant emissions in the history of modern atmospheric chemistry. A home-made Water-based Long-Path Absorption Photometer (LOPAP) along with other instruments were used to measure the HONO and related pollutants from January 1, 2020 to March 6, 2020, which covered the Chinese New Year (CNY) and the COVID-19 lockdown. The average concentration of HONO decreased from 0.97 ± 0.74 ppb before CNY to 0.53 ± 0.44 ppb during the COVID-19 lockdown, accompanied by a sharp drop of NOx and the greatest drop of NO (around 87 %). HONO budget analysis suggests that vehicle emissions were the most important source of HONO during the nighttime (53 %) before CNY, well supported by the decline of their contribution to HONO during the COVID-19 lockdown. We found that the heterogeneous conversion of NO2 on ground surfaces was an important nighttime source of HONO (31 %), while that on aerosol surfaces was a minor source (2 %). Nitrate photolysis became the most important daytime source during the COVID-19 lockdown compared with that before CNY, resulting from the combined effect of the increase in nitrate and the decrease in NO. Our results indicate that reducing vehicle emissions should be an effective measure for alleviating HONO in Beijing.\nStatus: final response (author comments only)\nViewed (geographical distribution)", "scores": {"score": 3, "score_transform_1": 5, "score_transform_2": 5, "score_transform_3": 0}}

{"id": "7274", "text": "There are a lot of different large powerhouses in the world of Marvel Comics, and two of them happen to be incredibly strong characters that have served as villains to different characters. We are talking about the large man named Juggernaut, who is known to be an unstoppable force in the X-Men storyline, and the Mad Titan named Thanos, who is a tyrant that has threatened the entire universe. So, in a fight between Juggernaut and Thanos, who would win?\nThanos is likely to win a fight against Juggernaut because he is more intelligent and has more powers and abilities under his disposal. He is also stronger if Juggernaut cannot pick up enough momentum. Of course, it would be very difficult for Thanos to hurt or damage him because Juggernaut is literally unstoppable.\nWhile it may seem like Thanos has more advantages over Juggernaut, the truth is that this should be a closer fight than anyone would imagine. That’s because Juggernaut is quite literally an unstoppable force that not even the strongest characters could stop or damage. So, with that said, let’s look at this battle in greater detail to understand more about it.\nJuggernaut is an incredibly strong character and is said to be a class 100+ villain in Marvel Comics. This means that he has enough strength to lift more than 100 tons, and that puts him on par with some of the strongest Marvel characters on Earth. But Juggernaut’s true strength lies in the fact that he is empowered by the Gem of Cyttorak, which makes him the avatar of one of the most powerful entities in the entire universe. As such, he has the ability to become stronger and unstoppable while he is gaining momentum.\nThanos is one of the most physically powerful characters in the universe of Marvel Comics because he has the ability to lift more than 100 tons and is on par with some of the strongest characters that Marvel has to offer. Some of his strength feats include being able to fight or even overpower the likes of Thor and the Hulk, who are two of the strongest Avengers. Thanos has also shown the ability to overpower the Silver Surfer with his strength.\nThis seems to be a very difficult round to judge because Thanos is normally stronger than Juggernaut. However, when Juggernaut picks up enough momentum, he should be a lot stronger than Thanos. As such, we’re looking at this one as a tie.\nJuggernaut 0, Thanos 0\nJuggernaut is quite possibly one of the most durable characters in the entire world of Marvel Comics because he is basically the Unstoppable Juggernaut. He is literally an unstoppable beast, especially when he picks up momentum, as he has always been one of the most durable characters of all time due to the fact that he is empowered by Cyttorak, who gives him the power to be unstoppable. Throughout his history, the only time Juggernaut gets stopped is through battlefield removal or when his opponent uses psychic or mystic abilities that are beyond physical.\nThanos is as durable as he is strong because he has the ability to take the same kind of damage that he can dish out. As an Eternal, he has nigh-invulnerability, and that means that he can resist all sorts of different attacks regardless of what their nature may be. This allows Thanos to continue to keep on fighting regardless of how much damage he has taken, as he is incredibly durable and is somewhere at the level of the likes of the Hulk and Thor in terms of how durable his body is.\nNormally, Thanos should be more durable than any other character. However, this is Juggernaut we are talking about, as we all know that he is unstoppable. In that regard, Juggernaut takes this round because no one can stop him when he picks up momentum.\nJuggernaut 1, Thanos 0\nAs strong and as mighty as Juggernaut may be, he isn’t exactly someone you could call smart, as he is neither a brilliant tactician nor a scientific genius. He is basically a brute that doesn’t have any intelligence feats throughout his entire history as a character. As such, there have been a lot of instances where he was defeated because his opponent was able to outsmart him or find a brilliant way to counter his unstoppable strength.\nThanos has always been a genius, even though he may not look like the smartest individual in the universe. His knowledge is actually cosmic and mystical in terms of its level because he knows a lot about how the nature of the universe works. On top of that, Thanos has always been a cunning tactician that knows how to use strategies to his advantage during a fight or a war. In that regard, he has always been a dangerous opponent because he isn’t simply a powerhouse but is also an evil genius.\nWe shouldn’t even be talking about this because there is no way that Juggernaut could best the genius intellect of someone like Thanos.\nJuggernaut 1, Thanos 1\nPowers and Abilities\nJuggernaut may be one of the strongest and most durable characters in the history of Marvel Comics because he is basically unstoppable. However, other than the fact that he has the Gem of Cyttorak, which allows him to become the avatar of Cyttorak and obtain a portion of his powers, he isn’t really capable of anything else. Juggernaut mostly just charges at his opponent while relying on the unstoppability that Cyttorak provides. Other than that, he isn’t capable of anything else.\nAside from the fact that he is an incredibly powerful individual and a genius villain, Thanos also has a few powers and abilities that he often doesn’t display and isn’t shown in the MCU. Thanos actually possesses strong psionic abilities that he often uses to defend himself against the psionic attacks of different characters that have powerful telepathic and psychic capabilities. On top of that, Thanos also has some knowledge and skill in terms of his mystic abilities, as he can perform magic as well.\nThe fact of the matter is that Thanos is simply much more well-rounded than Juggernaut in terms of the things that he can do. He has a lot more powers in his bag of tricks and can even hurt Juggernaut using his psionic and mystic abilities.\nJuggernaut 1, Thanos 2\nOften seen as an unstoppable brute that simply bum-rushes his way to victories against his enemies, Juggernaut actually has some skill in terms of hand-to-hand combat as he knows how to use his fits and incredible strength to his advantage. This has allowed him to go toe-to-toe with the likes of the Hulk in a few of their fights. Nevertheless, he was never the most graceful and skilled fighter, but he still gets the job done because he actually has some training in the realm of unarmed combat.\nAdding to his versatility is the fact that he is also a skilled unarmed combatant that knows how to use his fists to his advantage in hand-to-hand fights against some of the most skilled fighters in the world of Marvel Comics. Thanos is also gifted in the use of weapons, as he has displayed his ability to use a few ranged and melee weapons in the comics and in the MCU. Of course, he isn’t at the level of Captain America in terms of his combat training and skills, but he is still an incredibly tough opponent to deal with in unarmed combat.\nWhile neither of them is the best when it comes to unarmed combat, Thanos should take this round comfortably, not only because he has better training than Juggernaut but also because he has more experience.\nJuggernaut 1, Thanos 3\nJuggernaut vs. Thanos: Who Would Win In A Fight?\nWhile the score may be 3-1 in favor of Thanos, this is actually a fight that should be closer than what the score might suggest. Thanos should win a fight against Juggernaut more often than not because he is smarter and has more powers, but all of those fights should be quite close because of the fact that Juggernaut is an unstoppable force. As such, while he has the advantage in almost every field other than durability, Thanos should have a hard time finding a way to deal with the unstoppability of Juggernaut. And he’d have to use every trick in the bag to defeat this incredibly tough opponent.", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}

{"id": "7347", "text": "If you’re looking for a company to help with search engine optimisation (SEO) for your website, then you have most probably come across some businesses that guarantee first page ranking in Google. Don’t trust them!\nThe problem with the companies making these sort of guarantees is that they are either blatantly being dishonest or they do actually deliver, but not in the terms you were expecting. Google itself frowns upon this type of promise.\nTo explain further, here are 4 tangible reasons why you should be wary of SEO companies that promise to rank your website on page 1 of Google:\n- Algorithms change: We all know that Google’s algorithms are updated and changed very frequently. Websites that were ranking well one week are nowhere to be found the next week. Even more confusing is that you can perform the exact same Google search on different days and have different rankings for businesses on page 1. So promising page 1 rankings consistently, is unrealistic.\n- Keywords vary in importance: If a company wants to make such a promise to you, then you can be sure that they will select the keywords used to achieve these high rankings. This is because it is very easy to rank well for obscure keywords that no one is searching for. No search volume = no traffic = no conversions. So being ranked on page 1 of Google doesn’t guarantee you success if practically no one is searching for those particular keywords in the first place.\n- Rankings don’t always equal traffic: What you really want is more targeted traffic to your website as this helps to increase your conversions. Ranking well in the search engines is only one part of achieving this goal, but it is not the goal itself. So if an SEO company guarantees first page rankings, ask them how they will guarantee an increase in traffic and conversions instead. That’s what really matters.\n- Unethical conduct: To promise something that is out of your control is unethical. To be sure, page 1 ranking in Google is reliant on so many changing factors, that guaranteeing it is just about impossible. At least on any consistent basis it is impossible, and especially ranking for keywords that actually increase your traffic and conversions.\nSo if you are searching for help with SEO, make sure that the firm guarantees a specific increase in traffic and conversions, rather than an insubstantial ranking on page 1 of the search engines.\nFor more information on search engine optimisation (SEO) for your business or on web design in Brisbane, call us on (07) 3333 2932 or request a free quote online.", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

{"id": "7384", "text": "Hearing Aid Repair\nIf you wear hearing aids, you know how disorienting it is to be without them. At Hearing Services of Antioch, we’re committed to making sure your hearing aids are in good working order for the entirety of their lifespan.\nToday’s hearing aids are robust, durable instruments, but you may still have a problem with them from time to time. The miniaturization of state-of-the-art technology makes them more vulnerable to damage from moisture and physical jostling. While good maintenance practices definitely go a long way toward keeping your hearing aids in good shape, most hearing aids will need a repair at some point in their lifetime.\nWe make most repairs in house on the day you bring your hearing aids in. We’ll also clean up your hearing aids and remove any accumulated moisture and/or debris. In some cases, hearing aids may need to be returned to the manufacturer for repair. If this is necessary, the repair may take 10–14 days due to shipping time and the manufacturer’s schedule. We are glad to offer you a “loaner” hearing aid for the time your hearing aids are being repaired.\nDo My Hearing Aids Need Repair?\nA hearing aid that won’t turn on or make any sound (a “dead” aid) requires repair whenever the troubleshooting steps above don’t make any difference. But a hearing aid may be making some sound and still require repair. If your hearing aids aren’t loud enough, or sound distorted, murky, or otherwise wrong to you, you should bring them in for repair.\nLikewise, if your hearing aids are whistling (feeding back) a lot, there may be an issue with your fitment that requires attention. If you notice that your batteries aren’t lasting as long as they normally do, a repair is probably necessary.\nFinally, if there is visible damage to the casing of your hearing aids, you should have them repaired immediately, even if they still work properly. A breach in the casing is sure to cause bigger issues if it is not repaired promptly!\nAvoiding Repair: Proper Maintenance Techniques\nHearing aids do not require a complicated maintenance routine, most of the time. The two main things to remember with hearing aids are:\n- Keep your hearing aids clean & dry\n- Keep your ears clean & dry\nAt the end of each day, wipe your hearing aids with a clean, dry cloth after you take them out. If you use disposable batteries, open the battery compartments to allow any accumulated moisture to dry out over night. Keep your hearing aids out of the bathroom while you are showering or performing other routines: moisture and cosmetic products can wreak havoc on hearing aids.\nIt’s not recommended to use cotton swabs to clean your ears. Earwax evacuates the ear canals on its own when we chew or speak. You can let some water run into your ears while showering, but make sure you give your ear canals some time to dry afterward before putting your hearing aids in. Never insert anything smaller than a towel into your ear canal.\nIf you spend a lot of time in humid climates, or sweat more profusely than others, it may be worth investing in a hearing aid dehumidifier, or dehumidifying charger (if you have rechargeable hearing aids). These devices remove moisture from your hearing aids overnight, so they’re clean & dry every morning when you put them in. They can extend the lifespan of your hearing aids significantly, and help you avoid some types of repairs.\nIf you have questions about Oticon hearing devices, reach out to our friendly team to inquire. We aim to be a comprehensive hearing health care center, and will work tirelessly to meet your needs.", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}
{"id": "7400", "text": "Anxiety and Quality of Life in Patients with Rheumatic Diseases\nIntroduction: Increased levels of anxiety are commonly reported by patients with rheumatic diseases in comparison to the general population. Rheumatic disease mostly follows a painful, progressively disabling course and has been shown to have a substantial impact on one’s daily quality of life and physical, social, and emotional well-being. The symptoms of rheumatic diseases can vary widely over the unpredictable disease course, which may contribute to symptoms of anxiety. Aim: The aim of the present study was to explore the frequency and determining factors of anxiety in patients with rheumatic diseases, and its association with quality of life among those patients. An additional goal was the identification of the appropriate interventions regarding anxiety management. Method: A literature review was performed via Medline, Scopus, Science Direct και Google Scholar databases, using the key-words: “rheumatic diseases”, “anxiety”, “stress” and “quality of life” and included articles published in English and Greek language during the period 1987–2017. Results: A growing amount of literature has explored the role of anxiety in patients with rheumatic disorders and concludes to high levels of anxiety ranging from 20 to 70% in these patients. This diagnosis may cause stress and uncertainty in patients and their relatives. The patient faces the unpredictable course of the disease and a painful progression marked with attacks. The resulting chronic pain, disability, social stress, isolation and movement limitations in individuals with rheumatic disorders contribute to the development of anxiety and impaired quality of life. When the clinical status in rheumatic disorders becomes complicated with anxiety, effective treatment, including drugs administration and/or psychological interventions, is necessary. Conclusion: Rheumatic diseases should be monitored for accompanying anxiety during follow-up. An increased awareness among health professionals dealing with rheumatologic patients is necessary in order to integrate detection and effective treatment of anxiety into the routine clinical practice.\n|Volume 56, N 4\n|Afroditi Zartaloudi , Ioannis Koutelekos", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}
{"id": "7407", "text": "Garden Soil vs. Compost: What’s the Difference?\nSoil and compost are both essential components of any successful garden, but it can be easy to confuse the two. While many people use the terms interchangeably, they’re not. In fact, the same thing.\nIn this article, we’ll be going over exactly what soil and compost are composed of, when to use them, and more handy relevant info. Let’s dive in below.\nOverview of Garden Soil\nSimply put, soil is the topmost layer of the Earth’s crust. Composed of a mixture of minerals, sand, silt, liquids, organic matter, and other components, soil is created through thousands of years of processes. Soil is the main medium that plants grow in, which ultimately makes it essential for all life on Earth. Because of the various environments on Earth, differences in weather and natural processes, soil changes radically around the globe.\nMost critically, soil provides structural support for plants, but that’s not all. Soil allows water and nutrients to flow to a plant’s roots while letting water drain away. Depending on the composition of soil, it may have higher levels of sand, silt, or clay. While these are all normal, too much of any one will cause problems with plants.\nAs the lifeblood of plants, soil is also the lifeblood of any gardener. Gardening can be easy to start out, but you’ll quickly realize that it gets complex. Determining what type of soil a plant natively grows in is a key skill gardeners learn because you’ll need to adapt your local soil to best match those conditions.\nOver time, any soil used to grow plants will become depleted of nutrients. Decomposing matter, kitchen waste, and gardening waste can usually be added to soil to replenish its nutrients. Compost is one of the biggest allies of soil, enriching its nutrients while providing many other practical benefits. Learning how to fertilize and amend soil is yet another major gardening skill.\nWhen to Use Garden Soil\nSoil should be the main medium that you grow plants in, and you’ll go through a ton of gardening soil as you begin learning how to garden. Most people don’t choose the type of soil they have on hand, plus the climate will also determine what type of plants you can grow and when you can grow them.\nWhile compost, fertilizers, and other amendments are extremely useful with soil, you should research your soil first. Preferably you can get it tested to see its chemical makeup, but that isn’t always an option. Soils with low nitrogen typically don’t get much organic matter, so adding loamy potting mix or compost will help.\nIn the end, your success with soil will rely on how well you pay attention to your plants and their needs. Don’t try to grow peppers in a cold climate, for example.\nTypes of Garden Soil\nThere are six main soil types, and it’s important that you learn their unique properties if you plan to garden. Each soil type has its unique strengths and weaknesses, with some better suited to growing plants than others. Let’s look at a brief overview of each major soil type and what you should know about them.\nTypes of Soil:\nIs it Eco-Friendly?\nYes, but only if we’re talking about real soil and not sterilized potting mix. A lot of potting soil sold in stores is technically soil, but with heavily modified sterilized contents that make it completely different from actual soil. If possible, use your native soil and amend it with organic additions like compost, lime, and companion planting techniques.\nOverview of Compost:\nCompost is pure decomposed organic matter, typically created on purpose by throwing kitchen and garden waste into a container. When aerated properly, compost is a rich, black soil-like compound containing an extremely dense nutrient content. Worms and other soil life may also be present in compost, and they’re usually a positive for soil as well.\nUnlike soil, compost alone can’t be used to grow plants. In most cases, it simply lacks the structural support and drainage that soil provides. That said, compost is just as useful as fertilizer, if not even better!\nCompost can be made from nearly any organic matter. Lawn clippings, leaves, dead animals, dead bugs, twigs, and branches are the most common ingredients used to make compost. Depending on whether the compost is being used or sold for a specific situation, higher green or brown content might be used in the mix.\nYou can buy compost at farmer’s markets, tractor supply stores, or specialty stores. You can also make it at home by simply throwing lawn clippings, leaves, and leftover organic kitchen waste in a dark container. Over time the mix will partially decompose and become compost.\nWhen to Use Compost\nUsing compost is always a great idea when you’re gardening. Because a lot of soil has become depleted of nutrients in the past centuries, adding compost to your soil when gardening is possibly the best way to boost the nutrient content. Compost can add structure to loose, sandy soils and even help break up clumpy clay soil.\nTo use it, simply use compost in place of fertilizer when planting. You can mix it in the soil, add a top layer to act as mulch, and use it as liberally as you’d like.\nTypes of Compost\nThere are two major types of compost: brown and green. Green compost is rich in decomposing organic matter like leaves, fruit rinds, and rotting plants. These ingredients make green compost extremely high in nitrogen content, which is great for plant foliage and vegetable growth. Brown compost is better for adding structure and improving drainage in sandy, loose soil.\nEven predominantly brown compost will have some green matter to keep decomposition going, but the ratio is what matters. Lots of green matter and little brown matter will make the compost stop decomposing, and not enough brown matter will halt things as well.\nIs It Eco-Friendly?\nCompost is one of the most eco-friendly products on Earth, composed entirely of rotting organic materials. While some commercial compost products have sterilized ingredients or nonrenewable minerals included, true compost will look similar to very rich, loamy soil. If possible, locally source or create your own compost.\nSoil is responsible for all life on Earth by supporting plant life, while compost is an extremely effective amendment. Paying close attention to the type of soil in your garden and amending it accordingly is critical to your journey as a gardener.\n- Hyundai vs. Toyota: Comparing Quality, Style, and Sales\n- Nissan vs. Toyota: Comparing Quality, Style, and Sales\nFeatured Image Credit: (L) funnyangel, Shutterstock | (R) jokevanderleij8, pixabay", "scores": {"score": 3, "score_transform_1": 5, "score_transform_2": 5, "score_transform_3": 0}}

{"id": "7423", "text": "Home isolation is causing some Australians grief and others to risk fines by breaking quarantine out of sheer boredom – but a survey of self-isolated office workers suggests the working-from-home trend will permanently change Australia’s working culture.\nSome 88 per cent of organisations have adopted working from home as part of their coronavirus response plan, according to a Gartner survey that found most employers were cutting costs during the pandemic by focusing on effective use of technology (cited by 70 per cent of respondents) and freezing new hiring.\nBut the changes to working patterns could prove to be much more enduring than the pandemic, if the results of another recent poll are anything to go by.\nAlmost 80 per cent of respondents to a OnePoll survey – which was commissioned by Citrix and queried 1,000 self-isolating office workers in the last week of March – believe working from home will be more common even after the coronavirus pandemic is finished.\nLittle wonder: 70 per cent reported that working from home makes them as productive, or more productive, than they were in an office environment.\nSome 49 per cent of respondents said they are working more productively during the time they would normally spend commuting to work, with 36 per cent saying they are less stressed and 32 per cent suggesting that working from home helps them concentrate better because they are not distracted by colleagues.\nEmployers vs employees\nFor many employees, the new working-from-home mandate is simply an extension of existing practices.\nFully 34 per cent of the OnePoll survey respondents were already working from home at least once a week before the pandemic began – ahead of French (26 per cent) and Italian (22 per cent) workers but behind those in the UK (45 per cent) and Germany (43 per cent).\nSome 54 per cent of Australian respondents had retreated to custom home-office spaces – suggesting that many workers have been mixing family life and working life much longer than their employers might have been formally aware.\nWorkers have enjoyed the benefits of home working for years – to the point that one 2017 Telsyte study found 51 per cent of respondents would accept a lower salary for the privilege of working from home.\nJust 35 per cent said they prefer traditional job roles involving working from the office five days per week.\nInterestingly, not all employers have felt the same way: IBM, a long-time supporter of remote working, famously recalled its employees back to the office in 2017.\nYet, facing the threat of the COVID-19 pandemic, even IBM has been proactive in reinstating the practice “wherever possible”.\nThat’s a much bigger commitment than the work-from-home compromises that some companies have offered – such as hot-desking, which was billed as a way of catering to mobile employees but seen by some as a cost-cutting exercise.\nGovernment from home\nPrivate employers have been striding towards working from home arrangements for many years, with a 2019 Indeed survey finding that 68 per cent of Australian employers allow remote working.\nReported benefits include increased productivity (67 per cent), improved morale (64 per cent), reduced employee turnover (57 per cent), and operational cost savings (51 per cent).\nYet 65 per cent of surveyed workers said their employers don’t offer a work from home policy – suggesting that many are simply not aware of what their employer is doing, or that the employer is only selectively offering the option.\nEven the one sector that has been particularly resistant to teleworking – the Australian public service – is being dragged through a remote-working boot camp as it prepared to loosen long-held constraints on the country’s more than 160,000 public servants.\nGovernment departments including the Department of Health, Department of Defence, and Services Australia have been progressing their contingency plans – potentially shifting tens of thousands of workers home for the duration of the pandemic, or beyond.\nAt the end of March, Commonwealth public service commissioner Peter Woolcott released formal guidance that said working from home was “a priority, wherever this is practicable.”\nThat’s a huge philosophical jump for a public service that saw Julia Gillard’s target of having 12 per cent of public servants teleworking from home by 2020 – to which she committed in November 2012 – as a radical stretch target.\nAt that time, Deloitte Access Economics research suggested that teleworking capabilities would improve the inclusiveness of the public service by empowering disabled, near-retirement, family carers, and regional and rural Australians to join the workforce.\nBut today’s all-in on working-from-home arrangements means that workers of all situations will benefit from the arrangements – and with all signs suggesting that they will be well received, working from home looks set to become a core part of the new normal.", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}

Originating from Saudi Arabia, this cheese-infused flatbread is enjoyed in every bakery and home due to its versatility and delicious taste.\nMade with a base of soft dough that melts in your mouth and topped with a scrumptious mixture of cheeses, this dish offers a wonderful combination of flavours and textures to satisfy your taste buds.\nTraditional Akkawi Manakeesh uses a combination of Akkawi cheese, as the name suggests, and other regional cheeses for an authentic taste.\nHowever, several variations now exist, including popular options like mozzarella, halloumi, and feta, which provide a balance of salty and neutral flavours. Whether served as an appetiser, snack or accompanied by tea-time, this cheese bread has become an integral part of Oriente médio culinary culture.\nTo prepare Arabic cheese bread, start with a basic dough made from yeast, flour, salt, sugar, and water. Once your dough has risen and is ready to shape, spread the cheese mixture of your choice on top, then bake until it achieves a golden-brown crust.\nEnjoy the warm, slightly crispy bread dipped in olive oil or topped with fresh vegetables, and experience a taste of the Middle East no matter where you may be.\nUnderstanding Arabic Cheese Bread\nArabic cheese bread, commonly known as Akkawi Manakeesh, is a delicious flatbread that is very popular in Saudi Arabia and the Middle East.\nThis savoury and scrumptious bread is typically made with simple ingredients, which include all-purpose flour, water, dry yeast, salt, sugar, vegetable oil, and the star ingredient – Akkawi cheese. Nigella seeds are often sprinkled on top to enhance the flavour and appearance of the bread.\nTo make Arabic cheese bread, you will start by preparing the dough, which involves mixing lukewarm water with dry yeast, followed by the addition of flour, salt, sugar, and vegetable oil. This mixture is then kneaded until a smooth dough is formed.\nTo allow the dough to rise, you should let it rest for about 2 to 3 hours, depending on the outside temperature and humidity levels.\nAfter the dough has risen sufficiently, you can start assembling your cheese bread. You divide the dough into even portions and roll them flat. Then, add a generous layer of grated or crumbled Akkawi cheese on top of each dough before folding and sealing the edges.\nOptionally, you may sprinkle nigella seeds on the surface of the dough for added flavour and visual appeal.\nWhen it comes to baking, a pre-heated oven is essential. You can bake your cheese bread at around 180°C (350°F) for about 15 to 20 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is beautifully melted.\nAkkawi Manakeesh can be enjoyed as a snack, appetiser, or even as a delightful breakfast dish. The bread is versatile, and you can try different variations using other types of cheese or adding herbs and spices to suit your taste preferences.\nAdditionally, Arabic cheese bread is often served alongside fresh vegetables, olives, or pickles, further enhancing the overall eating experience.\nIngredients for Arabic Cheese Bread\nIn this section, we will discuss the essential components of Arabic cheese bread, focusing on two critical parts: the dough and the cheese filling.\nThe foundation of Arabic cheese bread is a simple Middle Eastern bread dough. To make this dough, you will need the following ingredients:\n- 500g all-purpose flour\n- 10g salt\n- 7g sugar\n- 15g active dry yeast\n- 300ml warm water\n- 30ml olive oil\nTo prepare the dough, first, dissolve the yeast in the warm water, allowing it to activate for about 5 minutes. Then, mix the flour, salt, and sugar in a large bowl. Gradually pour the activated yeast water and olive oil into the dry ingredients, stirring well to bind.\nKnead the dough for about 5 to 10 minutes to develop gluten. Let the dough rise for about 2 hours 30 minutes, or until it has doubled in size.\nThe Cheese Filling\nThe cheese filling is what gives the Arabic cheese bread its distinct flavour and texture. For a traditional cheese mixture, combine the following ingredients:\n- 250g Akkawi cheese, grated (you may substitute with mozzarella or a mix of mozzarella and feta)\n- 1/2 tablespoon nigella seeds (optional)\n- 1/2 tablespoon sesame seeds (optional)\nTo prepare the cheese filling, simply mix the grated cheese with the optional nigella and sesame seeds. Then, preheat your oven to 200°C (392°F).\nAfter your dough has risen, divide it into 8 equal portions. On a floured surface, roll each portion into a flat, round shape about 5mm thick. Spread the cheese filling evenly over each dough circle, leaving a small border around the edge to allow for any cheese expansion.\nBake the Arabic cheese bread for about 20 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and the edges are golden brown.\nNow that you have the ingredients and instructions for both the dough and cheese filling, you are ready to create your own delicious Arabic cheese bread. Enjoy as a snack, appetiser, or breakfast dish!\nBefore you begin, gather the following ingredients for your Arabic cheese bread:\n- Warm water and yeast to activate the dough\n- Flour, salt, and sugar as basic dry ingredients\n- Oil to mix with the dough\n- A combination of cheeses, such as mozzarella, parmesan, halloumi, or feta\nStep 1: Activate the yeast by stirring it into warm water, and let it sit for 5 minutes or until it starts to bubble up.\nStep 2: Combine the flour, salt, and sugar in a large mixing bowl. Gradually pour the yeast water and oil into the dry mix while stirring well to bind the ingredients together.\nStep 3: Knead the dough for 5 to 10 minutes. You may need to adjust the amount of water or flour to achieve the right consistency. The dough should be smooth and elastic.\nStep 4: Rest the dough for 30 minutes to an hour; this will allow it to rise and become easier to work with. Preheat your oven to 450 F (230 C).\nStep 5: Divide the dough into four equal-sized pieces. On a floured surface, roll each piece into a disc about 10 inches (25 cm) in diameter.\nStep 6: Prepare your choice of cheese combination. Drain any excess moisture from the cheese (especially important if using Akkawi or Halloumi) and evenly sprinkle it over the dough.\nStep 7: Bake the cheese bread in the preheated oven for 12-15 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and the bread is golden brown. Keep an eye on the oven to ensure it doesn’t overcook. Remove the bread from the oven and allow it to cool slightly before serving.\nKeep in mind that you can get creative with your toppings and try different combinations of cheeses, and herbs, or even add some za’atar or tomato-onion mixture for a more flavourful experience. Enjoy your Arabic cheese bread!\nWhen it comes to enjoying your Arabic cheese bread, there are various ways to serve and relish this delicious treat. Here are some suggestions on how to make the most of your cheesebread experience.\nFirstly, you can enjoy Arabic cheese bread, such as Akkawi Manakeesh, as a delightful appetiser. Cut the freshly baked flatbread into smaller pieces, and serve it with a side of olives, pickles, or fresh vegetables.\nThis will create a lovely contrast of textures and flavours, allowing you to have a fuller-tasting experience.\nAnother way to serve your cheese bread is as part of a Middle Eastern breakfast spread. Alongside dishes like hummus, labneh, and fresh fruit, the cheese bread will add a scrumptious savoury option that complements the other elements of the meal.\nAdditionally, a cup of strong, hot Arabic tea or coffee would pair wonderfully with the cheese bread, bringing warmth and intensity to your morning meal.\nMoreover, you can use the Arabic cheese bread as the base for a delightful sandwich. Stuff the flatbread with grilled vegetables, salads, or various meats for a wholesome and filling lunch option. Feel free to get creative with your fillings to personalise your cheese bread sandwich.\nFinally, consider serving your Arabic cheese bread warm and accompanied by a dipping sauce.\nA tangy yoghurt sauce, a flavour-packed tahini dressing, or even a simple drizzle of high-quality olive oil and za’atar can all enhance the overall taste and texture of the cheese bread. Experiment with different combinations to find your favourite pairing.\nIn summary, there are many ways to serve and enjoy Arabic cheese bread, making it a versatile and delightful addition to any meal.\nArabic cheese bread, known as manakish, holds a special place in Middle Eastern culinary traditions. As a staple food in many Arab countries, it serves as a symbol of togetherness, community, and shared history. While enjoying this delicious delicacy, you are participating in a cherished cultural practice that has persisted for generations.\nIn the Middle East, bread is not just a component of meals; it represents life itself.\nManakish, a dough-based food topped with various ingredients, is a versatile dish that can be enjoyed at any time of day. Having it at breakfast or lunch, paired with your favourite beverage, offers an authentic taste of Arab hospitality and warmth.\nThe preparation of manakish itself is a social activity, as family members often gather to knead the dough, mix the cheese with traditional spices, and bake the bread in communal ovens. This collaborative process fosters a sense of community and connection, qualities that remain integral to the Arab way of life.\nLastly, it’s important to note that Manakish symbolises the rich and diverse culinary heritage of the Arab region. With each different topping or cheese variety, you are introduced to the unique flavours and ingredients that have shaped this cuisine.\nIn partaking in this timeless and delicious tradition, you continue to contribute to its enduring cultural legacy.\nVariations of Arabic Cheese Bread\nArabic cheese bread, also known as manakish, is a versatile and delicious dish that can be customised to suit different tastes. In this section, we will explore a few popular variations of this Middle Eastern favourite that you can try at home.\nOne variation of Arabic cheese bread is the cheese manakish. This version uses a simple all-purpose dough topped with a combination of cheese and nigella seeds, making it a great option for a tasty snack, appetizer, or even breakfast. All you need is just 7 ingredients and 20 minutes of hands-on preparation.\nAnother popular variation is Akkawi Manakeesh. This type of cheese bread incorporates akkawi cheese, a soft, salty cheese common in Middle Eastern cuisine.\nTo make Akkawi Manakeesh, you will need to prepare a dough using flour, salt, sugar, warm water, yeast, and oil. Once the dough is ready, simply roll it out, top it with the akkawi cheese and nigella seeds, and bake until golden and delicious.\nIf you’re looking for something with a bit more zest, you might enjoy the zaatar manakish. This option incorporates zaatar, a Middle Eastern spice blend made with sumac, thyme, sesame seeds, and salt.\nTo make zaatar manakish, create a dough as you would for the Akkawi version, then divide it into equal balls. Flatten each ball, top with zaatar, and bake on parchment-lined baking sheets.\nIt’s worth noting that cheese breads can be enjoyed with various toppings, including:\n- Herbs like mint, parsley, or coriander.\n- Sliced vegetables, such as tomatoes, cucumbers, or onions.\n- Olives or pickles for a tangy touch.\n- Various types of cheeses, such as mozzarella or feta.\nBy exploring these variations of Arabic cheese bread, you’ll not only expand your culinary horizons but also find new, delicious ways to enjoy this popular Prato do Oriente Médio.\nArabic cheese bread, also known as cheese manakish, offers several health benefits to add value to your meal. It is not only delicious but also nutritious, making it a great addition to your diet.\nFirstly, the bread itself is made from simple ingredients like flour, water, and olive oil. Olive oil is rich in healthy monounsaturated fats, which may support heart health and help lower bad cholesterol.\nBy using olive oil in the dough, the bread gains a boost in its nutritional profile. Plus, it does not contain any artificial additives or preservatives, making it a wholesome choice compared to processed bread.\nThe cheese used in Arabic cheese bread is typically a blend of Akkawi and Nabulsi cheese, both of which originate from the Middle East.\nThese types of cheese are rich in protein, calcium, and phosphorus, which are essential for maintaining strong bones and teeth. Additionally, they contain probiotics that facilitate a healthy gut and immune system.\nArabic cheese bread can also be adapted to include vegetables such as spinach or herbs like zaatar, which further enhance its nutritional value. Adding vegetables increases the content of vitamins, minerals, and dietary fibre, while herbs like zaatar provide both antioxidants and anti-inflammatory properties.\nTo summarise, Arabic cheese bread offers a variety of health benefits:\n- Rich in healthy monounsaturated fats from olive oil\n- Contains protein, calcium, and phosphorus from cheese\n- Free from artificial additives and preservatives\n- Can be customised with vegetables and herbs for extra nutrition\nBear in mind that moderation is key, and it is important to consume Arabic cheese bread as part of a balanced diet. By incorporating this tasty and nutritious treat into your meals, you can enjoy both the delicious flavours and health advantages it has to offer.\nWhen preparing Arabic cheese bread, specifically Akkawi Manakeesh, you might encounter a few common mistakes. By being aware of these pitfalls, you can avoid them and create a delicious cheese bread to enjoy.\nIncorrect Yeast Activation:\nOne common mistake is not activating the yeast properly. To avoid this, always use lukewarm water—not too hot nor too cold—and give the yeast time to dissolve and bubble up. Remember to add sugar, as it acts as food for the yeast and helps it activate.\nAnother issue that can affect the final texture of your Arabic cheese bread is not kneading the dough sufficiently. Kneading allows the gluten to develop, resulting in a soft and elastic dough. When making Manakeesh, ensure you knead the dough for at least 10-15 minutes or until it becomes smooth and elastic.\nInsufficient Dough Resting Time:\nLetting the dough rest is essential for its texture and flavour development. During this process, the yeast ferments the dough, producing a delightful flavour and allowing it to rise. Allow the dough to rest and double in size before proceeding with shaping and baking.\nOver- or Under-baking:\nTo achieve a perfectly baked Manakeesh, monitor the bread closely in the oven. You want it to be golden brown and slightly crispy on the outside while keeping the inside soft. Over-baking can result in dry, hard bread while under-baking might leave the cheese under-melted or the dough soggy.\nBy considering these common mistakes and taking the necessary precautions, you can ensure a successful and delicious Akkawi Manakeesh – a crowd-pleasing Arabic cheese bread for you and your guests to enjoy.\nArabic Cheese Bread – Conclusion\nIn summary, Arabic cheese bread, also known as Manakeesh, is a popular and versatile dish found in Cozinha do Oriente Médio. It can be enjoyed at any time of the day, as a snack, appetiser, or even breakfast.\nMade with simple dough and various cheese toppings, this delightful flatbread offers a delicious and satisfying experience for your taste buds.\nIf you decide to try your hand at making your Arabic cheese bread, you’ll find that the process is relatively straightforward.\nIdeally, having a selection of cheeses like Akkawi and za’atar will give your bread an authentic flavour profile. Additionally, incorporating nigella seeds into the recipe contributes to both texture and taste, yielding a dish that is enjoyable for all.\nAs you explore different variations of Arabic cheese bread, don’t hesitate to experiment with other ingredients and flavours to suit your personal preferences.\nThe basic dough recipe provides an excellent canvas for creativity. Whether you enjoy it as a savoury treat or paired with tea or coffee, Arabic cheese bread remains a cherished delight within Middle Eastern cuisine, and now, in your kitchen.", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}

{"id": "7461", "text": "Preparing Yourself For Your Surgery by Ron Eslinger, CRNA, MA, APN, BCH, CI\nIn 1982 Ron Eslinger recorded his first “Preparing for Surgery and During Surgery” tapes. In 2000, Blue Shield of California reported they had a new tactic to ease surgery: The insurer sends members a 20-minute guided-imagery tape or CD. Patients listen to it several times before surgery. A soothing voice instructs them to visualize an operating room complete with a team of competent surgeons and a cheering section of their family and friends. Next, it guides them into a recovery room where they calmly awaken as their body continues to heal. It sounds a little strange, but studies have shown that patients who listen to the tapes experience less anxiety before surgery, and less blood loss and pain after surgery. They even need less medical care and medication. According to the National Institutes of Health, relaxation techniques such as guided imagery and hypnosis are excellent for stress reduction and pain management.\nResearch associated with this product:\nThe Effects of Guided Imagery on Post-Operative Outcomes in Patients Undergoing Same-Day Surgical Procedures\nAuthors: Capt Eric A. Gonzales, RN, BSN, NC, USAF; Capt Rachel J.A. Ledesma, RN, BSN, NC, USAF; Capt Danielle J. McAllister, RN, BSN, CEN, NC, USAF; Lt Col (sel.) Susan M. Perry, CRNA, MS, NC, USAF; Lt Col Christopher A. Dyer, CRNA, MS, NC, USAF; CDR John P. Maye, CRNA, PhD, NC, USN; Capt Michael R. Eslinger, CRNA, MA, NC, USN, Retired.\nAffiliation: Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences\nIntroduction: Guided imagery, a form of relaxation using deliberate daydreaming, is a complementary therapy often utilized by anesthesia providers which can positively impact peri-operative outcomes. While several investigations have suggested guided imagery improves peri-operative outcomes in the inpatient settings, there is limited research into the value and feasibility in the ambulatory surgery realm. The purpose of this investigation was to evaluate the effects of guided imagery on postoperative outcomes in patients undergoing same day surgical procedures.\nConclusion: The utilization of Guided Imagery in the ambulatory surgery setting, even when initiated just prior to surgery, can significantly reduce preoperative anxiety which can result in less postoperative pain and earlier PACU discharge times.\nI recently had liposuction surgery and the anesthesiologist (who is now a certified hypnotherapist) let me listen to both of your surgical CDs. Following the surgery, everyone said that they had never had any recovery like I had…no pain, and feeling well. I really believe it was due to the CDs. -Anita\nI never did tell you that I DID listen to your pre/post surgery CD before and after surgery and I did very, very well. I don’t recall having any serious pain–maybe just a little discomfort but nothing a few pain pills couldn’t handle. I remember my two C-sections as being considerably worse. Even though I’m 20 years older, I healed very quickly–the doctor was even surprised–and went back to work in less time than predicted (he released me 4-1/2 weeks after surgery instead of 6 weeks). In truth, I could have come back to work sooner than that…but I enjoyed my time at home and milked it for all it was worth! -Joanne\nI’m a fellow CRNA. Anywho, I bought your preparing for surgery hypnosis CD at the spring OSANA meeting in Columbus, Oh and used it for approximately 7 days preop before having a Decompressive Lami L4-5, with screws, plates and posterior IB Fusion. I wanted to tell you how WELL I have done post-op. My biggest fear was Post-op N&V which I always suffer from terribly, I had NONE!!! Have had Zofran before without success, now this time I did get 8mg of Decadron with the Zofran but I’m sure your D had a great deal to do with my comfort as well. Woke up in RR and remember I kept saying, “I’m not sick” “I’m not sick”. They had me on a Morphine PCA basal rate of 2mg/hr, never used the bolus at all. Did have an On Q pump with Marcaine 0.5% in the epidural space which I know helped a lot but still, not to be sick with a Morphine pump…..UNBELIEVABLE!!!

{"id": "7508", "text": "Coleman Marine Insurance were once again exhibitors and sponsors at the 5th Poole Harbour Boat Show (PHBS), which took place from Friday 7th – Sunday 9th June. Interest in the Show has risen significantly year on year and this year all exhibitor berths in the marina and on the quayside were sold out with many first- time exhibitors at the Show.\nTony Pauffley, Broking Manager, Yacht at Coleman Marine Insurance took time out to meet up and chat with many of the exhibitors attending the show. Tony advised, “Coleman Marine Insurance is delighted to be an event sponsor once again and we are thrilled to see that the Poole Harbour Boat Show is growing in both reputation and size. It was good to see so many new elements to the show this year. We have been heavily involved since it was created in 2014 and feel a part of its journey. We’re looking forward to continuing to be a part of its future success too.”\nWave Boat UK showcasing innovation\nRobert Wilson, owner of Arba nautika & Wave Boat UK was at the PHBS for the second time. He advised, “It’s fantastic for business, we’ve achieved loads of solid leads and hopefully even some unexpected exposure on ITV Meridian! We’ve brought along the full range of Arba and some Wave boats too. We’ve launched the 656 Wake Model at the show. It’s powered with a 300 horse- power jet ski and has grabbed lots of attention from boat show visitors as it’s an extremely innovative and new way to power boats – it’s new to the UK market and very exciting!”\n‘Achieving brand awareness and sales’\nWill Eveleigh of Silver Boats, based in Christchurch, was also experiencing his second PHBS. He said, “It’s great to be back here. We’ve had a few clients seek us out and visit the stand to see the new cabin boats. The show sees the UK debut of the 8.2 metre Silver Raptor which sleeps 4. It’s also the only boat in the show to have a Suzuki 350 horse- power motor. We’ve had a UK debut on the 6 metre Silver Tiger which sleeps 2 and are also showing the aluminium hull 4.9 m Silver Fox.\n“We’ve sold a Silver Tiger at the show to date, to a local buyer, and have a sea trial booked on the Silver Fox. We’ve achieved lots of quality leads. It’s very much about brand awareness for us here.”\nThe Big Harbour Clean Up and eco- friendly boat show.\nJake Sculthorp and Rosie Bailey were at the PHBS representing their organisation, GoPladdle and the Big Harbour Clean Up. GoPladdle was founded along the south coast of the UK, with a mission to unite communities and clean up our oceans and beaches, focusing not just on cleaning efforts but also prevention.\nGoPladdle’s team of willing volunteers drove the ‘Big Harbour Clean Up’ which took place in May, in conjunction with the Poole Harbour Boat Show and ‘Surfers against sewage plastic free communities’. At the PHBS they were displaying just a very small portion of plastic waste that had been collected from just one weekend of the Big Harbour Clean up. Rosie advised, “Over just one weekend of the beach clean- up we collected enough plastic rubbish and waste to fill 4 skips! Our display has instigated lots of conversations and interest from show visitors. It has been fantastic for awareness.”\nRosie continued, “We founded GoPladdle in June 2018, after having spent lots of time on the coast, noticing just how much litter and plastic waste there is, often in inaccessible places. As a result, we decided to buy some 2nd hand kayaks to assist in our mission to clean up Poole Harbour and since our launch we have held a few beach clean ups, partnering with the Council, Poole Harbour Commissioners and Lush.\nThe Big Harbour Clean Up display fitted in with the PHBS’s ambitious plans and aims to make the boat show as eco- friendly as possible. Poole Harbour Boat Show Marketing Manager Tracy Payne advised, “We are eliminating our use of single-use plastics, wherever possible, and asking our exhibitors to do the same. We provided them with our ‘top tips’ for being an eco-friendly exhibitor. We encouraged visitors to the boat show to bring refillable water bottles and provided details of all the refill stations to be found at the event in the show magazine. Poole Quay Boat Haven also provided refillable coffee cups to all of our exhibitors.”\nNewfoundland working dogs – ‘a connection with Poole from the late 1700’s’\nThe Newfoundland working dogs were a welcome new addition to the PHBS and certainly drew the crowds. Members of the organization, New Forest Working Dogs said, “We are a training group and come together to teach the skills of life guarding and water rescue, using the Newfoundland and Leonberger dogs. It’s our first time at the PHBS. We are aiming to demonstrate the potential that these dogs can bring to the professional rescue services, such as the RNLI and coast guard. In the UK they are a much under used asset. We intend to educate and raise their profile. They were bred for rescue purposes and are trawler dogs.\n“There is a really strong connection with Newfoundland and Poole. This is because in the late 1700’s there was a lot of trading going on between the two. They would export goods from Poole and bring dogs back from Newfoundland and sell them along the quay. The dogs were also used to run the fish carts!”\nEducating and inspiring show visitors to ‘get on the water’\nTracy Lee is a volunteer at Poole Yacht Club and was on a busy stand that was created by local Poole harbour yacht clubs. Tracy advised, “The different boat clubs and their volunteers have come together as a joint collaborative venture to educate visitors to the show about sailing, water sports, share their passions for marine and inspire others to join them on the water. We are very well supported by the RYA and they have provided the stand and some marketing support, as well as hosting free ‘try a dinghy’ sailing sessions. We are also taking people out for a ‘try sailing’ sessions in a small sailing yacht. I’m particularly passionate about getting more girls and women in to sailing. Over the weekend we’ve enjoyed multiple conversations with visitors, it’s been great, as well as having the opportunity to speak on film to ITV Meridian. It’s all fantastic for our cause.”\nRomsey based RS Sailing were brand new exhibitors at the PHBS and were showing their dinghies, keel boats and catamarans. George Purchon of UK retail sales advised, “Our CEO visited the show last year and felt that it was important that we became a part of it, so here we are! One of our drivers is participation and getting people in to the sport and on to the water. A lot of people here are in the early stages of their sailing journey. We are keen to get our brand known and recognised. We’re gaining lots of leads, having many conversations and making new friends. We have a range of differently priced products on display, to appeal to the beginner, through to the elite performer.”\n‘Affordable and hassle-free boating’\nThe Boat Club is based at Parkstone Marina in Poole. Co-founder Chris White commented, “The proud claim of The Boat Club is that we offer an affordable and hassle- free alternative to boat ownership. We have a joining fee, rolling monthly fees which give our members unlimited access to our fleet of 16 boats, all moored at Parkstone Marina. When exhibiting at boat shows we find that we plant the seeds of Boat Club membership with individual visitors. We connect with them and then invite them to our open days. It works really well for us and we particularly enjoy our presence at the PHBS. In the last year we have doubled our membership.”\nHelping out on the stand was a Boat Club member, Paul Saroney who advised, “I have the benefit of a choice of boats without having the concerns of the loss in value of my investment and the enjoyment of a wide choice of boats. It’s hassle- free and I love it!”\nA great day out for the family\nThe Miller family travelled from Bradford Upon Avon in Wiltshire to visit the show. Dad George was accompanied by 3 of his children. Monty 8, Ellis 5 and Maddi 13. George advised, “It’s a great way to entertain the kids. We like the free element and the fact that there is so much to do and see. As a father of 4 it’s usually so expensive for a family day out but this event makes the marine world and activities accessible. It’s definitely been worth the trip!”\nColeman Marine are the specialist Marine Division of Stackhouse Poland Group Limited, providing Insurance expertise and products across the marine insurance sector, from yachts to superyachts to marine business.\nPlease call if you have a need of our Insurance expertise.

{"id": "7520", "text": "Regular Bathtubs and Walk-In Baths; the most sought after the answer is what are walk-in baths and why not conventional bathtubs? Let us start with a simple thought of defining Walk-In Baths. Walk in Baths can be defined as special baths or tubs having doors that open and close at a side of the bath tub. So, one of the major advantage over regular bathtubs is the elimination of the need to enter the tub lifting one’s legs. This is very beneficial for senior citizens considering their fight against weaker bones and muscles.\nHere we look at few benefits of Walk-In Baths:\n- Easy Accessibility: As we have seen the major reason for choosing Walk In Baths tubs is the ease of use. When talking about people with walking difficulties, the walk-in tub offers precise and effective help.\n- Floor Flooding Issue Control: Being in a very confined space, the spilling of water on the floor is minimized to a large extent. This helps on saving the time on cleanliness.\n- Safety: With proper convenience for usage as well the less mess, makes it quite safe when compared to its counterpart. The spilling of water is very dangerous if the person is unaware of it and falling may induce severe injuries. Thus, this makes the Walk-In baths a little better than the usual bathtubs.\nWell, when we see the merits of the Walk-In Baths, downsides must be heeded as well:\n- Space Constraints: These Baths are usually shaped like a chair, where the person can enter from one end. This restricted space makes it difficult to move for a long time and stay in a single position which might get exhausting for older people.\n- Powerful Water Heating Arrangement: As, we have to fill the tub up to the right temperature, an efficient water heating system is a must if the tubs are to be utilized to their full potential.", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}

{"id": "7531", "text": "Editor’s note: This story first appeared on palabra, the digital news site by the National Association of Hispanic Journalists.\nBy Tatiana Alejandra\nOn June 1, Diego Dulanto Falcon, a 23-year-old immigration rights advocate, grabbed his Peruvian flag and spent the afternoon on the steamy pavements of Al Lopez Park in Tampa, Florida. Falcon, a DACA recipient protected from deportation by the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, joined other Latinos in peacefully protesting against Senate Bill 1718, the state’s newest anti-immigration law.\nDespite Falcon’s best efforts and those of local immigrant rights groups such as WeCount! and the We Are Florida Coalition that had been mobilizing against the proposed legislation for months, SB 1718 went into effect on July 1, 2023, becoming the toughest state-led anti-illegal immigration law in the country in more than a decade.\nThe law, which began as a proposal by Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis, cracks down on unauthorized labor and imposes a series of immigration-related restrictions. Among other provisions, it criminalizes traveling across state lines with undocumented individuals; expands the E-Verify system, which allows employers to confirm that prospective employees are eligible to work legally in the U.S.; and invalidates certain out-of-state licenses issued to non-citizens and some visa holders.\nFalcon comes from a mixed-status family that has lived in the Sunshine State for 19 years. Some of the proposals in earlier versions of the bill made them worry for their safety, and they had serious discussions about leaving. House Bill 1617, an earlier version of the proposed legislation, criminalized Floridians who shelter, support, and provide transportation to undocumented immigrants. While the harsher provisions of the original bill were modified to ensure its passage, Falcon felt that Florida Republican officials crossed a line. “They’re getting a lot more blatant and more offensive … like they’re just being a lot more forward with their attacks now,” he says.\nFalcon is getting ready to begin his first year of graduate school in public health at the University of South Florida, so his family has decided to stay –– for now at least. Coming from a low-income household, Falcon worries about the future of his family’s finances if they decide to leave. “I’m probably going to have to save up a lot of money and tank my credit score just to move across states,” he said.\nHowever, for him, the sacrifice might be worth the sense of safety. “My credit will get better eventually, but my time here in Florida will not,” he added.\nThe chilling effect\nIt’s still too early to gauge the direct impact of SB 1718 on mixed-status families, but community leaders throughout the state have noticed a shift since the law passed.\n“A lot of people did pick up and leave,” says Saman Movassaghi Gonzalez, managing attorney at Florida Immigration Law Counsel in the city of Pembroke Pines. “There has been just an increase of fear. I would say that is the number one emotion that’s driving the situation.”\nGonzalez has been working to educate and provide clarity about the provisions of the new law, not only to undocumented families, but to multinational corporations, national employers and local organizations concerned about its effects.\nIn Central Florida, Laudi Campo, Florida state director for the nonprofit advocacy group Hispanic Federation, recalls a conversation with a member of her organization who owned a landscaping business. According to Campo, he sold everything and left the state. Campo says he called the Hispanic Federation after his departure and said, “I’m not going to take it … and my wife doesn’t have papers, so I’m not going to risk it.”\nFelipe Sousa-Lazaballet is the executive director of Hope CommUnity Center in the city Apopka, one of the organizations involved in advocacy efforts that ultimately helped weaken earlier versions of SB 1718. “(In) our ESL (English as a Second Language) program, we’ve noticed that the number of students has been reduced this semester, less than what we had expected,” says Lazaballet. The Center reached out to the missing students and learned three families had already left Florida.\nEchoes of Arizona\nThe scope of the social and economic impact of the law will be unknown for some time, yet Floridians might look to Arizona for clues about potential ramifications. In 2010, Arizona’s SB 1070, also known as the “papers please” law, was a Republican legislative effort to get undocumented immigrants to self-deport or avoid traveling into the state. Within a year after it was passed, an estimated 100,000 to 200,000 immigrants left Arizona, an exodus that eventually led to economic consequences felt throughout the state.\nThe National Immigration Forum has reported that Florida’s law is also likely to have a detrimental effect on residents, institutions and key industries that heavily rely on an immigrant workforce. The Migration Policy Institute and the American Immigration Council estimate there are between 770,000 and 911,00 undocumented migrants living in Florida. At least 77% of them are Latino, according to a Migration Policy report. Without these undocumented workers, tourism, construction, and agriculture industries are among six key economic sectors that would lose up to 10% of their combined workforce, as stated in a report by the Florida Policy Institute, and Florida’s gross domestic product (GDP) would drop by $12.6 billion in a single year.\nChanging travel plans\nDays after SB 1718 was signed, the League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC) released a travel advisory for the state warning Latino tourists in particular that they should “be cautious if they encounter law enforcement.” Shortly after, other civil rights groups issued similar advisories.\nIn 2022, Florida received 137 million visitors, a record for the state, according to Visit Florida, the state’s official tourism marketing corporation. A year prior, Florida visitors contributed $101.9 billion to the state’s economy, supporting over 1.7 million jobs. While it will take time to assess what, if any impact of SB 1718 or these travel advisories will have on the Florida tourism industry, some Florida organizations have been witnessing small shifts in revenue. AllTheRooms, a company providing vacation rental analytics, reported a drop in short-term rental revenue by nearly 35% in May 2023, compared to last year’s earnings. According to a Spectrum News 13 report, that same month, the tourism association VisitOrlando found a 26% decline in rental bookings through Airbnb over the previous year and overall occupancy for this year has dropped by 10%. July 4, one of the busiest days of the year for Walt Disney World, was the third-slowest day of the last 12 months at Disney’s Hollywood Studios, according to a report by Touring Plans. Thrill-Data, a theme park data collector, also found that this year’s Fourth of July holiday was the slowest for Disney Parks in the past 10 years.\nIn 2011, a year after Arizona passed its own anti-immigration law, the state’s tourism industry suffered in the aftermath, including a total loss of $45 million in hotel and lodging revenue due to canceled conventions, according to the Center for American Progress. The losses rise to an estimated $141 million when accounting for food and beverage, entertainment, in-town transportation, and retail sales that an average conference attendee spends when visiting the state.\n“There was no movement … there was no growth,” remembers Salvador Reza, a long-time Phoenix activist and community organizer. In 2010, as a leader speaking out against SB 1070, Reza played a pivotal role in organizing a people’s march with thousands of protesters, as well as the year-long campaign leading to a boycott of musical performances in Arizona, known as the “Sound Strike.”\nThe economic toll\nFlorida’s construction sector might also be looking at potential negative economic impacts as a result of SB 1718. Even before the law went into effect in July, a local CBS News affiliate in Miami spoke to construction employees in the area who say immigrant workers are fearful of going to work and are instead fleeing the state. Videos of informal reports of empty construction sites have popped up all over social media.\nRoughly 23% of the construction industry in Florida is composed of undocumented immigrants, with approximately 450,000 construction migrant workers throughout the state.\nSamuel Vilchez Santiago is the Florida state director for the American Business Immigration Coalition, an organization that helps immigrants enter the economy as consumers, workers and entrepreneurs. Santiago, who sees construction as a critical state industry threatened by the new law, worries that the potential decrease in migrant workers could mean construction companies might fail to provide the services they need in order to get the job done. “We need everyone we can get in order to fill critical labor shortages in key industries that are the backbone of the Florida economy,” he says.\nUnder Florida’s new E-Verify system, private employers with 25 or more employees must use a federal government database to verify that new hires are authorized to work. If an employer fails to use the verification system three times within a 2-year period, they can be fined up to $1000 a day. For undocumented workers currently employed, this system will make it harder for them to find future employment, and companies that rely on migrant labor will face additional barriers in order to meet their staffing needs.\nIn 2008, Arizona implemented its own E-Verify system through the Legal Arizona Workers Act (LAWA). According to a report by the Cato Institute, between July 2007 and December 2014, Arizona’s construction employment declined by 45.6%. While experts say it is hard to evaluate the law’s true impact due to the 2008 recession, the construction sector experienced a deeper decline in Arizona and bottomed out worse than California and New Mexico.\nIf faced with similar labor shortages, Florida construction companies might be compelled to raise wages to attract more legal workers, ultimately pushing up costs for prospective property buyers — a move that would negatively impact residents who are already dealing with high inflation rates and an overvalued housing market.\nLabor shortage concerns\nSome undocumented immigrants take on jobs with construction companies during the summer, when few crops thrive in Florida, but return to the fields in the fall to work in agriculture. The agricultural industry makes up 1.5% of the state’s annual GDP and generated $7.7 billion in 2021.\nJeannie Economos, pesticide safety and environmental health program coordinator for the Farmworkers Association of Florida, says that both farm and land owners have recently reached out for help. Concerned about losing hard-skilled workers and knowing some of them are not legally authorized to work, they have asked her to come out and explain the law to farmworkers, she says, and reassure their fears. “Whereas before it was always the workers who were afraid of immigration issues, now the growers are also because they’re afraid that the government’s gonna come down and find them,” explains Economos.\nThe Farmworkers Association is one of the groups involved in a lawsuit against SB 1718, but while the law is in place, Economos is trying to educate industry stakeholders about the different provisions of the law. One concern is Section 10, which makes it a third-degree felony to knowingly transport an adult undocumented immigrant into or out of Florida.\n“There are some (South Georgia) churches that help farm workers from (North) Florida and so they are able to take farm workers back and forth,” says Economos. Church members offer transportation to hospitals, attorney appointments, schools, church services and other resources across state lines, and bring them back home. Without this resource, life for undocumented immigrants can become more challenging in rural communities.\nIf undocumented farmworkers leave as they fear, and hiring legal workers through the now-mandatory E-Verify system becomes more expensive, farm owners are concerned about retaining their land. “Some farmers, especially smaller growers are frustrated, because if they don’t have the money … and if they are worried about employing undocumented workers, they might just sell their land for development,” said Economos.\nA report by the Cato Institute found that Arizona’s agriculture employment was “greatly disturbed” between the implementation of E-Verify in 2007 and the passing of SB 1070. Around that same time period, it appeared that neighboring states, California and New Mexico, saw an increase in agricultural workers. During the early days, supporters of SB 1070 and state-mandated E-Verify believed that jobs vacated by unauthorized workers would be filled by native-born Americans. Yet, vacant jobs were not filled, neither in agriculture nor in construction, according to Cato’s Policy Analysis. The Pew Research Center reported that the state’s population of undocumented workers dropped by 40,000 between 2009 and 2012. According to Arizona’s Economic and Business Research Center, the average farm decreased in size from 1,670 acres to 1,312 acres between 2007 and 2021.\nIn Florida, agriculture has the highest number of non-citizen workers in any state industry, with 37% of the workforce. As the second-leading state with the largest number of undocumented immigrants working in agriculture, it’s unclear to what extent Florida farms will be impacted by SB 1718. Still, Economos expects the fall to bring some insight to the industry. “When the crops really start coming in and need to be harvested, that’s really going to be a reckoning to see what happens when the growers are looking for workers,” she said.\nA little over two weeks after SB 1718 was enacted, several civil rights organizations and legal advocates filed a lawsuit against the DeSantis administration. The lawsuit challenges the constitutionality of Section 10, which criminalizes the transportation of undocumented individuals into Florida. The plaintiffs argue that the state government can be held accountable for taking over the federal government’s central role in regulating immigration and violating their right to due process.\nIn Arizona, legal challenges the U.S. Department of Justice and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) presented against SB 1070 were somewhat successful: The Supreme Court partially struck down the legislation in 2012. That too came at a financial cost, as Arizona spent over $1 million in legal fees to defend the bill against several court challenges, according to an ACLU report.\nBeyond the economic impact of Arizona’s restrictive immigration laws, political observers have made connections between the anti-Republican feelings the those laws generated among Latinos and a political change that was reported throughout the state. Between 2012 and 2020, there was an increase of 304,803 Democratic voters in Maricopa County, the largest county in the state, whereas Republican voter registration increased by 229,600 voters. Then, in 2020, President Joe Biden became the first Democratic nominee to win the state since Bill Clinton in 1996, and two years later, Katie Hobbs, a Democrat, was elected governor.\npalabra tried to reach several Florida Republicans to inquire about their views on the potential economic and political consequences of the new law, including state Sens. Jay Trumbull, Tom A. Wright and Ana Maria Rodriguez, all members of the State Senate Committee on Commerce and Tourism; as well as Rep. Randy Fine, who co-sponsored his chamber’s version of the bill; and the Governor’s Office, but received no response to comment.\nSome Republicans who voted to pass the new law have been actively trying to prevent a potential exodus of undocumented workers by highlighting loopholes in the legislation and the limited funding that might make it difficult to fully enforce. Speaking in front of a crowd of Latino attendees at a faith-based public forum meant to discuss the implications of the new law, Rep. Rick Roth, a third-generation farmer from Palm Beach County, stated that SB 1718 was “100% supposed to scare you,” while urging his audience not to leave Florida. In an interview with NPR, Roth admitted his Republican colleagues were unprepared for the destabilization the bill would cause among Florida’s immigrant communities.\nFlorida Democrats, for their part, are hopeful for a political shift as they gear up for the 2024 election. State Rep. Anna V. Eskamani serves various parts of Orange County in Central Florida and believes SB1718 can help propel that change. Eskamani has joined some of her colleagues in the Florida Democratic Party on the launch of the”Take Florida Back” tour. The campaign aims to narrow the gap in voter registration between Democrats and Republicans, and has been traveling all over Florida meeting with residents to discuss issues they care about.\n“There was a Tampa Bay restaurant owner who was a long-time Republican, and he spoke out against the policy and said it was impacting his workforce,” said Eskamani. “I think we are starting to see some of those cracks within the Republican Party.”\nEskamani says that Florida Democrats are working hard to appeal to voters from different political ideologies and backgrounds, whereas “the Republican Party can be branded as creating problems, fomenting crisis, deflecting, dividing, and putting into place policy that don’t make us more safe, but actually make it much harder to operate and live in Florida.”\nFor Eskamani, it’s not only about using a different rhetoric, but about having policies that reflect different values. “You not only repeal these policies, but you put protections in place for those who are undocumented,” she says. “You treat them like the humans that they are. You get them the same access to rights as anyone else should have.”\nTatiana Alejandra is a graduate student in the Reporting The Nation & New York program at New York University.

{"id": "7534", "text": "The huge leaps in technological development have made it possible for businesses to improve a variety of processes, even on a limited budget. A good example is customer service, a process that is crucial for every business, yet can quickly drain resources if not handled correctly.\nLuckily, chatbots are a simple solution that can help businesses significantly improve these processes at a fairly low cost. Let’s take a look at all of the benefits that a software tool like this might bring to your business.\nHow can you improve customer service with chatbots?\nThis technology allows businesses to be much more flexible. What does this mean? Well, a business owner can work with developers on creating a completely custom chatbot that is going to meet and greet a customer as a real person would.\nFurthermore, a chatbot does not have an hourly rate, but is active at all times. This means that your business can offer support to customers from all over the world at all times of the day. With this approach, a business can significantly improve its customer support, further driving the overall business growth.\nFor example, there are multiple channels on which you need to deploy customer support agents. This means that someone should be answering emails, others should work on social media network interactions, whereas the third group should focus on direct communication with customers on the website, via a live chat tool. With a chatbot, you get a single solution that can communicate across all channels.\nThis not only cuts expenses on employee salaries, but it also enables you to have all of your customer support channels open at all times.\nHow much is achievable with this technology?\nThis is the question that most people are interested in. How much can a bot actually help a business out. Well, to put it simply, there are no limits. To fully understand this statement, we have to dig a bit deeper.\nEvery chatbot you plan to use comes with particular sets of templates, however, its true power lies in its customization and flexibility.\nWhat does this mean? You can easily set up different bots across different channels of communication. One customer service chatbot can deal with shipping information, the other one can deal with refunds, whereas the third one can help customers learn how to use your product or service.\nMore importantly, it is possible to actively work on chatbot development. With enough time invested, it is possible to create a bot that will be able to actually replicate a human being. Of course, this takes a lot of dedication and is an ongoing process, however, it is completely achievable.\nRealistically speaking, it is possible completely fine-tune your complete customer support with a chatbot. There are no limits, provided that you and your team are ready to dedicate enough time on chatbot development. Not to mention that the whole process is completely user-friendly, and you do not need to be tech savvy in order to create your own custom bot.\nIt is no wonder that market size projections show how important chatbots are going to be in the near future.\nWhat is the investment that you are going to make?\nAll of the abovementioned information sounds too good to be true. There must be a catch right? Once every business owner sees the power of the chatbot software, the next question is the price. Luckily, there is plenty of competition in this market, and there are plenty of great free chatbot software tools, like SnatchBot.\nThat’s right, you don’t need to invest thousands of dollars in order to use this technology. However, it is important to note that you will have to invest a lot of working hours in developing the chatbot, in order to reach the maximum benefits that this software tool has to offer.\nOnce you see positive results from creating and using a chatbot, then you might expect additional expenses so that you can take advantage of more features, better scalability, and other similar bonuses of the platform.\nAs you can see, integrating a chatbot through a user-friendly platform like SnatchBot is now possible for any business. There are plenty of solutions on the market nowadays, making it possible to create your own customer support chatbots without any significant financial investment.\nWe are yet to see what the future holds, as chatbots start learning from every interaction. That is certainly going to be the next big thing in the chatbot world – you will be able to spend less time on optimizing the chatbot, as it will take care of the process on its own.", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}

{"id": "7558", "text": "I have always loved Chicken Parmesan, and with the crispy coating and melty, gooey cheese I’m sure I’m not alone. However, it’s not a dish I tend to make at home; since it involves frying chicken and making pasta and making a sauce, it’s one I wait to order in a restaurant. But no more! This easy dump-and-bake casserole brings you the very same flavor with virtually no prep. It’s just a matter of stirring together a few ingredients, letting the oven do its work and voila – chicken parm!\nIf you haven’t made a dump-and-bake pasta dish before, you’re in for a treat. You don’t have to boil a single noodle – all you have to do is stir the pasta into the sauce ingredients (usually with a little extra liquid involved) and the pasta simmers in the sauce in the oven, so it’s extra flavorful.\nIn this case, we’re using spaghetti, which gets mixed with marinara and some water, mozzarella, garlic powder, and chicken. You don’t even have to cook the chicken ahead of time, that’s how easy this is!\nYou just stir all that together, cover it with foil, and pop it in the oven. Once the pasta is nearly al dente, you top it with breadcrumbs and cheese and let it hang out in the oven again until the cheese is nice and melty and the breadcrumbs are crunchy.\nThat means you still get the crunch of that signature crispy breadcrumb coating, but you didn’t really have to coat anything, let alone go to the trouble of breaking out your frying pan.

{"id": "7633", "text": "How Do Coffee Makers Work?\nHave you ever wondered how coffee makers work? Put simply, a coffee maker is a device that produces brewed coffee using ground coffee beans. It works by heating water to the desired temperature and then pumping it through the ground-up roasted coffee beans or bean powder.\nThe resulting hot liquid, called espresso or ‘coffee’, is then either served in cups, mugs, or pots or stored in a thermos. The process of making brewed coffee with a coffee machine involves several steps.\nFirst, the correct amount of ground coffee needs to be added to the filter basket – usually around two tablespoons for every cup of coffee. Next, hot water is poured into the reservoir and heated until it reaches the desired temperature – usually between 185 and 200 degrees Fahrenheit.\nOnce heated, the machine pumps and pushes the water through the filter basket filled with ground-up roasted beans which extracts flavor from them and creates freshly brewed espresso.\nFinally, additional ingredients such as milk and sugar can be added to enhance flavor and texture. As soon as these are mixed in with your espresso drink, it is ready for consumption!\nWhether you’re an experienced barista or just getting started at home brewing your own delicious cup of java, understanding how an automatic coffee machine works will help you get a perfect brewing time.\nCoffee machines are a great way to make delicious coffee quickly and easily. But how do they work? Let’s take a look at the different kinds of coffee machines and how they use aluminum tubes, warm water, and coffee pots to brew your favorite cup of joe.\nThe most common type of single-serve coffee machine is the drip-style brewer. This machine uses an aluminum tube that runs from the reservoir base to the filter basket.\nHot water is pumped through this tube, heating up the grounds in the filter basket and producing freshly brewed espresso. The resulting liquid then passes through a spout into a carafe or coffee pot below.\nAnother popular kind of pod coffee maker is the French press. This device works by placing ground beans in a cylindrical container with a plunger on top.\nWhen hot water is poured over the grounds, it steeps for several minutes before being pressed down with the plunger, trapping all of the flavors inside. The resulting liquid can then be poured into cups or mugs for consumption.\nFinally, there is a single-serve coffee maker that uses pre-packaged pods or capsules filled with ground beans to produce espresso kinds of drinks quickly and easily. These machines use a heating element to heat up the water and force it through the pod, producing a freshly brewed espresso in just seconds.\nNo matter what type of coffee machine you use, understanding how they work will help you get the most out of your brewing process.\nDrip Coffee Machines\nA drip cup coffee machine has a few key components that make it work. At the heart of it is an electric heating element which warms up the water and then passes it through the grounds.\nThe water then drips into your carafe, forcing out all those delicious flavors from your freshly ground beans! This can be controlled with a timer, enabling you to have a fresh coffee-making process with minimal effort.\nThe brewing chamber is where it all happens. It contains a filter basket where you place your ground coffee, which allows for extraction into the carafe below and serves as a connection between the reservoir with water and the cheap coffee maker deals itself once sealed.\nThe water reservoirs on coffee machines are just as important because it’s what contain the hot water and funnels it into the brewer chamber when ready. Lastly, there’s the carafe itself – made from either stainless steel or glass – or both!\nUsually, they come with filtering lids to keep out unwanted particles while pouring your cup of joe. All of these components are essential in producing a quality cup of coffee.\nWorking Of The Heating Element\nThe heating element coil of a drip coffee machine plays a key role in making your morning cup. This part is responsible for warming and circulating hot water, which is then mixed with the ground coffee to create the perfect brew.\nThe resistive heat element works by using electricity to generate heat and circulation. Heat is generated through two pieces of wire, with the electrical current running from one end to the other.\nThis generates a powerful current that raises the temperature of the water so it can be distributed evenly throughout your device and make sure you get consistent results when using it for your daily coffee ritual.\nTo ensure the proper optimal temperature is maintained, most drip coffee machines come with thermostat control which enables you to set your desired level of heat as per your need. This way, you don’t have to worry about going overboard with extra heat or getting a bitter drink due to too little!\nProcess Of Making Coffee\nMaking coffee with a drip coffee machine is a simple but satisfying roasting process.\nFirst, you’ll need to measure out the desired amount of ground coffee beans and place it in the filter attached to your machine. Then, you’ll add freshly-boiled water over the grounds – an important step to ensure maximum flavor extraction from the beans. After all of the water has passed through, you should be left with a delicious cup of coffee!\nYou can control the strength of your brew by altering how many coffee grounds you use or even by controlling the flow rate of boiling water that passes through. Additionally, if using filtered or bottled water is part of your routine, then you can expect an even smoother-tasting drink!\nWith all these options, there’s no doubt that a basic drip coffee maker is one of the most versatile pieces of kitchen equipment.\nHow To Fix A Clogged Machine?\nHaving a clogged machine can be incredibly frustrating, especially when you have coffee drinkers coming in looking for a smooth cup of java. But don’t worry, there are a few ways that you can fix your clogged machine!\nThe first step is to check and make sure the filter you are using is not outdated or damaged and replace the filter if necessary. After that, be sure to thoroughly clean the filter holder and carafe before adding new grounds. You’d also want to use high-quality coffee beans and grind them fresh – this helps ensure a smoother flavor.\nFinally, if necessary, run some water through the filter basket to flush out any remaining ground. Doing this every month will help prevent future clogs from occurring!\nEven if all else fails, it might be worth giving your machine a professional cleaning from time to time so it can continue running smoothly and serving up delicious cups of coffee all year round!\nWhen it comes to making a perfect cup of espresso, components do matter. Professional Espresso machines come with various components that are key for producing delicious double espresso.\nThe most important component is the boiler, which controls the heat and pressure of the water used in brewing – without proper control, your espresso machine pump won’t be as great as you want it to be.\nAdditionally, group heads are crucial in regulating how much water is pushed through coffee grounds during extraction. As water runs through the grounds, the amount of pressure and speed must be calibrated precisely or you may run the risk of over-extraction or under-extraction, which won’t give you that silky smooth texture that high-quality espresso should have.\nAnd lastly, filters – help extract all those oils and fragrances from freshly ground coffee beans and also control how fast or slow water passes through them.\nAll these parts help create a perfect cup of espresso so if you’re considering buying an espresso machine for home, make sure to check out these components first!\nProcess Of Making Coffee\nMaking a great cup of coffee starts with understanding the basic process involved in espresso machines. To make coffee, one needs to grind freshly roasted beans, which should be freshly ground in order for minimal oxidation, maintain consistent particle size and extract maximum flavor through optimal brewing at optimum temperatures and times.\nOnce the beans have been ground, they are placed into an espresso portafilter. Hot water is then pressured through the portafilter at 9 bar of pressure; this water, combined with the pressure extracts more complex flavors and aromatics from the grounds than hot water alone. The result is a thick and flavorful shot of espresso.\nSome machines offer additional features such as milk-frothing capabilities or pre-programmed settings that allow users to make specialty beverages with just a few clicks. All these features help make making an excellent cup of espresso easy and efficient. With the right select quality components and care, espresso can be enjoyed for years to come!\nUsing an espresso machine can be a great way to prepare tasty coffees, but there are some common problems that you may encounter when using them. One common issue is clogged brewing heads, which can occur if coffee grounds are left inside the filter basket or not cleaned out properly. This prevents the water from flowing properly and will result in an under-extracted coffee.\nMaking a barista-style hot drink at home is easier than ever with the right components. An espresso machine is an essential tool for any coffee lover, and it consists of several metal components that work together to produce a delicious cup of espresso.\nThe first component is the boiler, which heats up water and creates steam ready for extraction. This steam is then pushed through the ground coffee beans in the portafilter, releasing all those delicious flavors and aromas. The pressure created by this process also helps create air bubbles in the espresso shot, giving it a creamy texture.\nAnother important component is the group head, which regulates how much water passes through the grounds during extraction. If too much or too little water passes through, you may end up with an over-extracted or under-extracted shot of espresso – neither of which will give you that perfect barista-style drink.\nFinally, filters are used to extract all those oils and fragrances from freshly ground coffee beans while controlling how fast or slow water passes through them. All these parts help create a perfect cup of espresso so if you’re looking to make barista-style drinks at home, make sure to check out these components first.\nKeurig Coffee Machines\nKeurig Coffee Machines consists of several components that work together to provide coffee drinkers with the highest quality cup of coffee every time. The biggest components include a single-serve carafe, K-cup holder, water reservoir, and a holder for pods.\nThe carafe is made from durable plastic and comes in different sizes so that you can accommodate different preferences easily. It holds up to 24 caffeinated coffee beverages per fill!\nThe K-cup holder serves as the primary component during brewing, allowing the machine to puncture each individual K-Cup for a perfect taste.\nThe water reservoir is also a crucial part of any Keurig Machine, as it holds enough liquid for one full pot of coffee base – more than enough to keep your caffeine worries at bay!\nFinally, the pod holder offers friendly storage for used pods so that you don’t have to clean them after every use or worry about overflowing messes. All these Air bubbles components work together seamlessly to give you the best cup of joe possible!\nProcess Of Making Coffee\nWhen you make coffee with a Keurig machine, the process is quick and easy. All you have to do is fill up the water tank, insert your K-Cup or K-Carafe pod of choice into the machine, and press start.\nThe Keurig Coffee Maker’s brewing technology then heats up the water and makes sure it reaches precisely the ideal temperature before releasing it through the pod and into your mug or carafe. Within minutes, you have yourself a perfectly brewed cup of hot delicious coffee!\nThe special pods that are used in a Keurig Coffee Maker also ensure that each cup of coffee has just the right amount of flavor and strength so you get the perfect taste every time. It’s no wonder why so many people around the world rely on their Keurig machines for their daily dose of caffeine!\nKeurig coffee machines have become a popular way to make coffee brews quickly and with little effort. However, users can sometimes come across common problems when using these machines.\nThese issues typically consist of the machine not turning on, water not coming out correctly, or issues with the tank lid not sealing correctly.\nIf your Keurig coffee machine fails to turn on, you may need to unplug and then replug the power switch in order to reset the machine. You should also check to see if the circuit breaker has tripped as this can cause a sudden lack of machine power.\nIf water is coming out too slowly or inconsistently during brews, you may need to clean out the tube that runs between the reservoir and the heating chamber as clogs can cause problems here.\nLastly, if your lid isn’t sealing properly, it’s possible that some liquid could be getting into other parts of the machine which could cause malfunctioning in other areas.\nFortunately, many of these are fixable but it’s important to recognize any potential issue prior to use in order to avoid major problems down the road!", "scores": {"score": 3, "score_transform_1": 5, "score_transform_2": 5, "score_transform_3": 0}}

{"id": "7703", "text": "By James Pavisian, Attorney\nOn July 24, 2014, Yvonee Wenger, a journalist at the Baltimore Sun published an article highlighting the Social Security Administration’s failure to implement a computer system that it has spent over $300 million to develop. The Social Security Administration is a federal agency. However, the states do a lot of the grunt work for the program.\nAs disability lawyers in Wichita, KS, we know that the Disability Determination Services (“DDS”) is under the auspice of the State’s Department for Children and Families. The Kansas DDS workers are State, not federal, employees. More importantly, DDS employees are the ones responsible for making the initial and reconsideration decisions for people applying for SSI or disability insurance benefits. Therefore, they hold great power.\nThe problem is that every State has a DDS run by one of its larger social service agencies. This has led to each DDS office to use different, oftentimes, proprietary software to keep track of claims, organize medical and non-medical evidence, and analyze other necessary documents exclusive to the disability determination process. This was a problem for the Social Security Administration because all of the different agencies and programs made it difficult to do quality control and keep track of critical program-specific statistics.\nThe software Social Security commissioned and has overspent on would have solved this problem. The software would have been implemented in all states and territories with DDS offices. This would have ensured everyone was on the same system instead of fifty different, state-specific programs. It would have also allowed Social Security to ensure all the States are playing by the same rules and to catch outliers and fraud much quicker and deal with it more efficiently.\nIt is unfortunate that the Agency’s efforts have been fruitless to this point. However, the status quo is too burdensome and leaves much to be desired. In my opinion, this project is one that will benefit future applicants and, therefore, should continue to be pursued. As we speak, the Agency has consulted with private sector groups to ensure steady progress.", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}

When you ask your team to find their own leads, they say it’s hard.\nThe leads have been provided, but what happened to the sales? And you would hear so many kind of excuses that would start with “I think..”.\nBelow are some reason why your sales team is not achieving their target even though so many leads have been provided for them.\nLow Lead Quality\nHow great are the quality of the leads provided to your sales team?\nIn order to answer the question, you must first determine the definition of good quality leads. For example, if I am in the automotive industry, my definition of qualified leads would be if the prospect passes the basic terms of car loan such as earning salary of RM2,000 and above, is employed for more than a year, and so on so forth.\nProvide a definition of qualified leads based on the criterias you are looking for in each one of the prospects.\nSome sales manager love to just purchase database and pass that information to their sales team. This is a guaranteed waste of time and energy because most of the prospects in the list would not be interested in purchasing your product. What’s the point of it then?\nThe Lack of Cooperation between the Sales and Marketing Team.\nIn order to get a high quality prospect, the sales and marketing team must work together effectively especially in the aspect of building the brand name and advertising.\nThe marketing team needs enough information and datas to get a qualified lead that supposedly matches the criteria.\nThe sales team then blames the marketing team because the leads provided turns out to be bad leads.\nHow do we solve this? Both departments should work hand-in-hand to communicate and find solutions together because each of their roles are vital. The sales team are the closest to the customer bases whereas the marketing team studies the potential customers.\nNot Utilising Automation in your Business\nIs this your business?\n- On the 1st day, the marketing team roles out an ad.\n- On the morning of the 2nd day, the marketing team then organises all the prospects attained into an excel sheet.\n- The excel sheet is then handed over to the sales team.\n- The sales team then gets to work and starts calling or messaging the prospects one by one.\n- Repeat the process all over again.\nIf this is the way your business is running, there are a lot of wasted time and efforts here.\nBased on the list above, there are a lot of automations that can be done to assists both the sales and marketing team to produce more sales.\nWhen the automation takes place, there are a lot of time that is saved. The number of sales are often linked with time.\nIf you delay getting in touch with the prospects, often times the prospects would no longer be interested and also not to forget, there are also plenty of other competitors in the market that are also targeting the same prospects.\nBesides that, with automation, your process of selling would be more efficient from lead generation all the way to closing the sales.", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

{"id": "7745", "text": "Introduction to Digital Marketing Trends in 2024\nThe start of a new year promises a period of unparalleled breakthroughs in the field of digital marketing. As technology advances, the dynamics of consumer behavior and market trends vary dramatically. Embracing these developments becomes the cornerstone of long-term success for marketers. Exploring and reacting to the shifting scene provides professionals with the insight required to build strategies that resonate effectively with audiences in the upcoming dynamic year.\nUnderstanding Consumer Behavior Shifts\nUnderstanding the complexities of changing customer behavior enables companies to design focused strategies that truly engage with their target audience, building long-lasting connections and driving company success.\nAdapting to Technological Shifts:\nThe fast adoption of technological advances impacts how customers interact with brands. Technology reshapes customer interactions, from AI-driven shopping experiences to augmented reality try-ons, requiring firms to modify their strategy for seamless integration.\nSocio-Economic Dynamics and Brand Relationships:\nConsumer decisions are influenced by changes in economic environments and cultural ideals. Brands that match with changing socioeconomic trends and advocate for causes important to their target audience connect with their customers more intimately, generating deeper bonds and brand loyalty.\nPersonalization in Consumption:\nConsumers are increasingly looking for individualized experiences. Tailoring products, services, and marketing messages to individual tastes becomes critical in catching attention and maintaining long-term relationships with customers.\nImpact of Evolving Lifestyles:\nConsumer demands are redefined when living patterns change, such as remote employment or health-conscious decisions. By addressing evolving customer needs, brands that adapt quickly and respond to these shifting lifestyles gain a competitive advantage.\nSEO Strategies for 2024\nSearch Engine Optimization (SEO) is still a critical component of online exposure. New algorithms and trends emerge in 2024, necessitating a more nuanced approach to SEO. Staying on top of SEO tactics is critical for organic reach, from semantic search to improved user experience.\nSemantic search will continue to drive SEO methods in 2024, prioritizing context and user intent over keywords. Marketers must optimize content by analyzing user searches and offering complete, relevant information, which aligns with the focus of search engine algorithms on context-rich results.\nPrioritizing Enhanced User Experience for SEO Success\nIn the Digital Marketing world of 2024, user experience (UX) is inextricably linked with SEO performance. Search engines like websites with easy navigation, fast loading times, and mobile friendliness. Marketers must focus UX components to enhance rankings and maintain visitor engagement.\nVoice Search Optimization: A Crucial Element in SEO Strategies\nThe rise in voice-enabled searches necessitates a change in SEO methods. Content optimization for conversational inquiries and long-tail keywords mimics natural language patterns, responding to the rising user preference for voice-assisted search. Adapting to these changes is critical for organic visibility.\nAlgorithmic Trends: Navigating the Dynamic Landscape of SEO\nA wave of algorithmic improvements is expected in 2024, emphasizing the importance of nimble SEO methods. Staying on top of search engine algorithm changes and adjusting fast provides long-term organic reach. Marketers must assess and change their SEO strategies to match these developing algorithms to get maximum visibility.\nContent Marketing Trends\nDynamic Content Preferences\nConsumers today seek more than just information; they want to have an experience. This transition necessitates content that goes beyond words, combining graphics, videos, and interactive components to connect and relate with people on a deeper level.\nPersonalization as a Priority\nTailoring material to individual audience interests and behaviors has become an unavoidable requirement. Content customization provides relevance, fosters relationships, and prompts action, eventually creating more engagement and conversions.\nAdapting to Changing Platforms\nAs new platforms emerge and user habits shift, successful content strategies adapt to reach audiences where they are. Understanding platform subtleties enables the creation of personalized content that fits into consumers’ consumption patterns.\nThe Role of Storytelling in Engagement\nCreating stories that engage emotions and elicit responses is eternal. Storytelling through multiple content formats enables companies to engage honestly, making a lasting impact on their audience.\nIncorporate Paid Social into Your Media Plan\nHarnessing the Power of Paid Social Advertising\nPaid social media advertising has developed as a powerful tool for companies looking to increase their reach and engagement. Platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, and Twitter provide advanced targeting possibilities, allowing firms to reach out to specific audience groups.\nMaximizing Reach and Engagement\nPaid social advertisements allow businesses to increase their visibility beyond their organic reach. Marketers may increase engagement, drive website traffic, and even produce leads or conversions by wisely allocating resources and creating attractive ad creatives.\nUtilizing Advanced Targeting and Retargeting\nOne of the primary benefits of paid social is its enhanced targeting capabilities. Marketers may personalize advertising based on demographics, hobbies, and behaviors, and even retarget people who have already connected with their brand. This targeted approach guarantees that the ad content reaches the most appropriate audience, boosting the possibility of conversion.\nMeasuring and Optimizing Campaign Performance\nPaid social media advertising provides comprehensive statistics and tracking capabilities. Marketers may track the effectiveness of their campaigns in real-time, allowing them to make immediate modifications and improvements depending on the data collected. This data-driven strategy guarantees that marketing dollars are used wisely, boosting ROI.\nLeverage Artificial Intelligence (AI) for Image Generation\nAI-Driven Image Creation\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) is not just reinventing data analysis; it is also redefining content production, including picture development. Cutting-edge AI algorithms can now produce high-quality, realistic photos, transforming the generation of visual material for Digital marketing campaigns.\nEnhancing Visual Content with AI\nDigital Marketing may use AI-powered technologies to create attractive images without substantial design skills. AI simplifies the development process, providing visually appealing content that connects with target consumers.\nThe Role of AI in Customizing Visual Assets\nAI algorithms evaluate data to learn about customer preferences, enabling the production of personalized visual assets.

{"id": "7750", "text": "Substance use disorders (SUDs) are fairly widespread among all American adults. However, some of the nation’s communities suffer from these disorders more than others. The list of excessively affected communities includes LGBTQ+ adults. What’s more, many LGBTQ+ Americans are in need of more than one form of substance use disorder treatment. That’s true because they’re affected by polysubstance abuse. In other words, they have multiple drug or alcohol problems. Effective treatment for polysubstance abuse requires targeted help for each problem affecting you.\nLooking for LGBTQ+-focused polysubstance addiction treatment in greater Minneapolis? Talk to the local professionals at Pride Institute. We specialize in providing high-quality rehab services to the LGBTQ+ community. That includes extensive resources for the treatment of polysubstance abuse disorders. We’re committed to helping you recover from each SUD affecting you. For more information about your treatment options, call Pride Institute at 888.408.1625 or connect with us online.\nDefining Polysubstance Use and Abuse\nOn any given day, tens of millions of Americans drink or take addictive drugs or medications. Some people only use one such substance. But the use of multiple substances is also common.\nWhat are the potential consequences of polysubstance use? Excessive intake of even one addictive substance can leave you affected by an SUD. It also introduces the possibility of experiencing a drug or alcohol overdose. Risks for both of these issues are magnified by polysubstance use and abuse. Not only can you develop multiple forms of SUD. In addition, you can:\n- Heighten your overdose risks by exposing yourself to certain substance interactions\n- Boost your chances of experiencing other kinds of serious side effects\n- Expose yourself to unpredictable changes in your physical or mental function\n- Decrease your ability to notice the actual harmful effects of any given substance\nYou may be fully aware that you’re using multiple substances. However, it’s also possible to unknowingly involve yourself in polysubstance use/abuse.\nThe Scope of the Substance Abuse Problem in the LGBTQ+ Community\nLGBTQ+ Americans have unusually high risks for dangerous polysubstance use. What explains this reality? Research shows that several underlying factors are involved, including:\n- The impact of discrimination against the LGBTQ+ community\n- A lack of adequate support networks\n- High levels of food insecurity\n- A relative lack of income\nNot everyone is affected by all of these issues. However, they’re common enough to increase risks within the community as a whole.\nThe Importance of Polysubstance Abuse Treatment\nSome people who abuse multiple substances are affected by clinical addiction. Others are not addicted. Still, their substance use causes them serious distress and disrupts their ability to function. Both of these issues fall under the general heading of SUD.\nPolysubstance addiction treatment typically begins with drug and alcohol detox. Detox helps you withdraw from the substances in your system. It also helps you avoid any potential withdrawal setbacks.\nWhether or not you’re addicted, recovery also requires active rehab. The rehab process includes therapy that helps you return to stable sobriety. If you have opioids or alcohol in your system, it may also include medication. Effective polysubstance abuse treatment is fully individualized. It provides targeted help for every SUD affecting you. This is essential to helping you regain your daily function.\nSeek LGBTQ+ Polysubstance Abuse Treatment at Pride Institute\nPolysubstance abuse treatment is a crucial resource for many Americans. That includes a significant percentage of the LGBTQ+ community. Effective treatment not only helps you recover from SUDs. It also helps you limit your overdose risks.\nAt Pride Institute, we feature LGBTQ+ polysubstance abuse treatment. Our inclusive approach allows you to recover in a welcoming, supportive environment. It also upholds our overall goal of providing quality care. Do you or your loved one need help? Just call us today at 888.408.1625.

{"id": "7766", "text": "|Back to Table of Contents\n|Lords Hansard Home Page\nThe Duke of Montrose: My Lords, it strikes me that under the Bill, weor perhaps more properly the Government and their administrators, who put these matters before usare sitting behind our desks and drawing lines on the map for areas for which we have only the sketchiest detail, in much the same way as the old colonial Administrations used to do for parts of Africa and North America. That was underlined by my noble friend Lord Kingsland who, with much more authority than I can bring, told us that we know only about 3 per cent of the area for which we are legislating. I am sure that the colonial administrators\n5 May 2009 : Column 504\nOf course, at this stage we are not causing disruption to any resident populations of humans or administrative boundaries of communities. However, as our knowledge of detail expands and as the structures we place on the marine conservation zones become more rigorously enforced, we may find that these boundaries are causing unnecessary complications. That might then be overcome by redrawing the boundary in a way that would appear to be logical, although currently we have no access to the logic that might be available to future generations.\nI find it of some interest that the mechanism used in subsection (4) in designating the different devolved areas is an Order in Council. Some kind advice that the Minister offered me is that Section 14 of the Interpretation Act 1978, if applied, would imply a power for amending or modifying an Order in Council.\nWhat strikes me is that what we are looking at here predates the coming of devolution while not predating our acceptance of some European legislation. The issue might not be as clear as it once was. Let us suppose it became necessary to move the boundary between the English and Scottish offshore areas, or, heaven forbid, a new Administration in Scotland decided that they were not going to participate in the marine policy statement, but would insist that an Order in Council was not just any order and could not be overturned. Perhaps they would be able to argue that under some abstruse European statute, Orders in Council came under the aegis of their Administration. A clause such as the one I have proposed might serve to clarify any doubt there would be on the point. I beg to move.\nLord Wallace of Tankerness: My Lords, I am not sure I can entirely follow the hypothetical case that the noble Duke, the Duke of Montrose, has set out, nor indeed where the Scottish Parliament might get some powers from a European source to insist on an Order in Council.\nUndoubtedly, the designation of boundaries has a capacity for controversy. When the Scottish Parliament was established just 10 years ago, I well recall that one of the first orders we had to pass, which had previously been passed in this Parliament, was to determine the boundary between Scotland and England for devolution of fisheries matters. They took a line, which went at an angle from where the Scotland/England boundary hits the coast just north of Berwick-upon-Tweed. That was contested by many Members of the Scottish Parliament, including those of my own party. Indeed, the first rebellion of my Back-Benchers was on that occasion, and we narrowly won the vote. Therefore, the issue is not without controversy.\nHowever, there are certain advantages and certainty with a boundary that is set rather than one that continually flows back and forth, although I noted in an edition of the Economist last month that because of melting glaciers in the Alps the boundary between Italy and Switzerland is on the move. I do not think that anyone is suggesting that there is a similar sort of geological change here, but I cannot honestly be persuaded by the case made by the noble Duke, although undoubtedly these are sensitive issues.\nLord Davies of Oldham: My Lords, I never thought that the issue of boundaries could be anything other than sensitive in almost any context. Therefore, I appreciate the interest in this clause and the amendment moved by the noble Duke, the Duke of Montrose. The Government consider that the time has come for the United Kingdom to declare an exclusive economic zone. This is an internationally recognised concept that is characteristically set out in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. Up to now we have declared different zones for different purposesfisheries, marine pollution, renewable energy and carbon storage. We recognise that the accumulation of these different zones produces the potential for confusion domestically, and is somewhat contrary to best international practice. Therefore, we believe that declaring an exclusive economic zone is the right course.\nWe do not think that the issue with regard to the amendment arises. The noble Duke referred to the Interpretation Act 1978, which applies to these orders made under Clause 39(4). I am sorry if it causes some difficulty, but the Interpretation Act is there to facilitate all concerned with these issues, to make it easier for the law to be understood and therefore enacted. Implied in the power in Clause 39(4) is a power to revoke, amend or re-enact any order made under that clause. Therefore, we already have, under the Interpretation Act, the very power that the noble Duke identified.\nI have no way of allaying the broad anxiety, which the noble Lord, Lord Wallace, indicated, that there can be differences of interpretation about the contestability of boundaries. I am all too well aware that that is a sensitive issue with implications as regards aspects of the relationship between England and Scotland, to say nothing of other devolved practice. I cannot answer that within the framework of this very limited amendment to the clause. What I am obliged to answer is why this amendment is not necessary and I have sought to make that case. I hope the noble Duke, the Duke of Montrose, is satisfied on that point.\nThe Duke of Montrose: My Lords, I am most grateful to the Minster for his reply. It is of course very useful that, even if the amendment is any good, he has at least stated the issue from the Dispatch Box for anybody who wishes to look at it again. We hope that if alterations to boundaries do become necessaryand I still think that they mightthey will be achieved amicably and that there will not be any need to worry about rescinding legislation. In the light of these matters, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.\nLord Davies of Oldham: My Lords, I say with some relief that this is definitively a minor and technical amendment to correct a grammatical error in the\n5 May 2009 : Column 506\nIn Committee I tabled amendments on the relationship between the marine policy statement and the national policy statements under the Planning Act. It was explained to me that the subsection that I had attempted to amend had the purpose of promoting internal consistency within the marine policy statement. I did understand that. I am sorry that I did not make it clear that I understood not only that but that my own amendments would have taken the matter of consistency into a different area. So I say at the start that I am concerned not about internal consistency within the marine policy statementI am concerned about it, but not for the purposes of this amendmentbut about how we can be assured that the marine policy statement and the potentially large number of national policy statements are consistent, not as a matter of intention or aspiration but through the process provided by the legislation.\nThese amendments seek a greater understanding of the process provided for by the legislation. Amendments 60 and 61 would deal with the marine policy statement covered in Clause 42. Grouped with them, as they are on similar points, are Amendments 76 and 77 to Clause 49, which is about marine plans, and Amendments 89 and 90 to Clause 56, which is about authorisation and the enforcement of decisions. I beg to move.\nLord Hunt of Kings Heath: My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Baroness for raising this matter. We come back to this relationship between the MMO and the IPC and also, in this group of amendments, the relationship between the marine policy statement and the national policy statements. She is right to say that there will be a number of those statements. I very\n5 May 2009 : Column 507\nThese are interesting amendments. One of their themes is the extent of the influence of the plans and the marine policy statement on the IPCs decisions; hence the amendment which would require the IPC to take its decisions in accordance with marine policy documents. Another thread in the amendments is that which relates to which documents and policies should take precedence in the event of a conflict between them.\nWe are always in danger of reopening the regime established by the Planning Act 2008, which the Government are reluctant to do. We believe that it has established a new regime for allowing us to address the national need for infrastructure that is vital to the future of this country. The new regime has been put in place precisely because of the recognition of the particular and special importance of nationally significant infrastructure projects and the considerable challenges that are related to them. In particular, I believe that there is a lot of support for the notion that there should be a special planning and consenting regime to consider them. Nationally significant infrastructure projects which are in the marine area, whether they are related to ports or energy generation, are a vital part of this new process. The Government have consistently argued that those projects should not be removed from the new planning regime simply because they are in the marine area.\nWe think that it is entirely appropriate that the IPC will make its decisions in accordance with the national policy statements but also have regard to the marine policy statement and relevant plans, because we think that that gets the relationship right. Clearly, as far as the IPC is concerned, the relevant national policy statement will be the prime statement. However, we are also clear that the IPC must have regard to the marine policy statement. I do not want to take us back to the debate on group 10, but we also expect the MMO to have a strong role by having to be consulted on pre-applications and then to have an involvement in the IPCs examination process itself.\nI also want to reiterate a point which I have made consistently. The national policy statements and the marine policy statement plans will be entirely consistentthey have to be. The same departments will collectively be involved in establishing both the NPS and the marine policy statement. It would be intolerable if there were inconsistency and conflicts between the two statements. It would not give the kind of clarity that all noble Lords, including me and the Government, wish to see.\nI know that the noble Baronesss Amendments 89 and 90 seek to ensure that policies in the marine policy statement or plans will always take precedence over those in the national policy statements. Of course, Clause 56 imposes a clear duty on public authorities, with the single exception of the IPC, to take any authorisation or enforcement decision relating to the marine area in accordance with the marine policy statement and plans. In contrast, the only public authority under a direct duty to take its decisions in accordance with the national policy statements is the IPC, in view of the national significance of projects on which it will take decisions. So those duties and the relative precedence of the marine policy statement and national policy statements in relation to authorisation and enforcement decisions seem to be entirely appropriate.\nThe question of precedence is less acute in relation to the secondary duty on public authorities to have regard to the marine policy statement and plans when taking their other marine decisions. Even so, that duty to have regard to the marine policy documents is clear and applies to any decision which is capable of affecting the UK marine area.\nI am not unrealistic. I recognise that there will sometimes be circumstances in which a planning authority is to have regard to both a national policy statement and the marine policy statement. Despite the best endeavours of government, there could be a conflict between the two which had not previously been foreseen, and I do not think that as a matter of principle one could provide that the marine documents should in all cases outweigh the national policy statements. Policies on matters of national significance will by their very nature often be different from those relating to local matters. Sometimes a decision-maker, such as a coastal local planning authority in the present context, may need to consider both when deciding what weight as a material or relevant consideration should be given to each. We have therefore not imposed duties to take these decisions in accordance with either the marine policy statement or the national policy statements, precisely because in such circumstances we believe that public authorities should use their discretion and judgment, looking at the context and the likely impacts of possible decisions.\nThat is not an unusual approach and, after many years experience, planning authorities are experts in weighing up and integrating government policy. We would also expect them to seek advice from the relevant department on how to resolve any conflict, which will help us to identify any potential need for clarification or amendment of our policies. It should not be a question of technical precedence but of taking the best decision for the marine area and the national interest in all the circumstances.\nIf the noble Baroness were to press her amendments and they were accepted by your Lordships they might reduce the clarity in the Bill about how any conflicts within the MPS or plan should be resolved. Clauses 42(3) and 49(9) presently provide that in the event of a conflict between the policy and any other information included in an MPS or plan, the conflict is to be resolved in favour of the policy. This provision is\n5 May 2009 : Column 509\nI apologise for speaking at such length. It is so good to see the noble Lord, Lord Alderdice, now in his place. It is not too late for him to intervene and explain why he thinks that collaboration between the UK Government and the devolved Administrations will not work on the marine Bill. His timing is impeccable.\nI fully understand why the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, has moved these amendmentsshe seeks clarity. I want to reassure her that we thought a lot about this. We do not want the circumstance that she fears to arise whereby there is a lack of clarity and a conflict and the relevant public bodies do not know what to do. It is clear, as it has to be, that the IPC must turn first to the national policy statements.\nI turn to my own amendment in this group. It is a minor and technical amendment to correct a typographical error in Clause 56(4). As noble Lords will have noted, the closing words should read in relation to which rather than relating to which, as currently in the Bill. I hope that noble Lords will support the Government on that amendment.\nWe on these Benches often see our role as one of asking the what ifs. I found what the Minister said very helpful. It certainly deserves to be read properly. It went a great deal further than the response that I had on similar amendments in Committee. He accepts the possibility of conflict, as do we, not least because the two sets of statements may have been developed at different times, with slightly different considerations. I need to think about his comment on not allowing a technical response and the Government being unable to tweak policy. I think that that was more or less what he said.\nI am left with one query. In saying that the MPS and the NPSs must be consistent, is the Minister saying that the Secretary of State would not agree something that was inconsistent if there were a conflict between the Secretary of State and one or more of the devolved Administrations? That seems to be what he is saying or the natural conclusion to his comments. His comments were helpful. I certainly do not intend to press the matter tonight. My objective is to understand the Governments thinking and how it would all work rather better than was set out at the previous stage. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.\nBaroness Thornton: My Lords, the reforms set out in this draft order aim to enhance public confidence in the ability of the healthcare regulatory bodies to protect the public and deal with poor professional standards. The order continues the process of implementing the Governments programme to improve patient safety through the reform and modernisation of the regulation of the healthcare professions, as set out in the White Paper, Trust, Assurance and Safety.\nI am aware that there has been a lot of interest in the build-up to this debate both in support of and against the provisions. There appears to be a good deal of confusion about the content of the order, what it provides for and what it does not. I should therefore like to spend a little time going through the provisions of the order and dealing with some of the issues that have been raised.\nThis order introduces statutory regulation of practitioner psychologists across the UK. It is in this area that I think most of the confusion has arisen, so let me make clear now that the order makes no provision at all for the regulation of psychotherapists or counsellors. Psychologists, psychotherapists and counsellors are part of a number of professional groups offering talking therapies. At the moment, the only regulated group is psychiatrists, who are regulated as doctors by the GMC. As doctors they can also prescribe drugs to patients. The next highest qualified providers of talking therapies are practitioner psychologists, who are now being regulated for the first time. They must all have postgraduate qualifications.\nConsideration is also being given to the regulation of psychotherapists and counsellors who have descending levels of professional qualification. The Health Professions Council has been working with bodies representing these groups to develop proposals but we are not there yet. Those discussions are continuing but no formal decisions have been made although we understand that the working group is hoping to report to the council of the HPC later this year. Any proposals to regulate psychotherapists and counsellors will be subject to further consultation before legislation is brought before the House. Given the weight of interventions on this matter by psychotherapists, we anticipate robust discussion and consultation.\nStatutory regulation exists to protect the public from poorly performing practitioners. It does this essentially in three ways: first, by setting standards of practice, training and conduct; secondly, by registering\n5 May 2009 : Column 511\n|Back to Table of Contents\n|Lords Hansard Home Page", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}

The 2016 Florida Derby Day handle was the highest in the history of Gulfstream Park with the exception of Breeders’ Cup Days.\nThe big day punctuated a banner 2015-2016 season that generated a record all-sources handle of $807 million, a 15-percent increase over the 2014-2015 record handle of $704 million. The new record was set despite 57 turf races moved to dirt, compared to only 13 last season.\nRiding the wave of strong wagering during the meet, the 20-cent Rainbow 6 generated a North American Pick 6 pool record March 28. Prompted by a mandatory payout and a carryover of nearly $4.5 million, wagering exceeded $10.8 million on the popular multi-race wager to produce a $15.185 million pool.\n“We’re extremely gratified with Gulfstream Park’s Championship Meet,” said P.J. Campo, Gulfstream’s General Manager and The Stronach Group’s Vice President of Racing. “Starting with the Claiming Crown back in December and building on key days like Holy Bull, Fountain of Youth, Sunshine Millions and the Donn Handicap, it seemed fitting our meet would culminate with a record Florida Derby Day and the wonderful performance by the undefeated colt Nyquist.\n“Despite an inclement December and 57 races being taken off the turf, we continued to build our racing program with incredible equine and human performances and wonderful support from horsemen throughout North America. We still believe there’s plenty of room for growth in our Championship Meet and we’re excited about our summer program; a program we continue to reinvigorate. We’re looking forward to a great summer with our Summit of Speed and Florida Sire Stakes races, and we’re looking forward to making our Championship Meet even better next year.”\nReddam Racing LLC’s Nyquist emerged from a 3 ¼-length triumph in the Florida Derby with a $600,000 winner’s purse, a $1 million bonus from Fasig-Tipton, and an undefeated record of 7-for-7 to stamp himself as the horse to beat in the Kentucky Derby May 2. The Doug O’Neill-trained colt became the first Eclipse Award champion to capture the Florida Derby since Fly So Free (1991).\nAlthough the most celebrated horse of the meeting, Nyquist was among a strong contingent of prominent major stakes winners to compete during the Championship Meet, most notably Shadwell Stable’s Mohaymen. The Kiaran McLaughlin-trained colt, who finished a disappointing fourth in the Florida Derby, earned favoritism in his showdown with Nyquist by winning both the Holy Bull (G2) and Fountain of Youth (G2).\nAl Shaqab Racing’s Mshawish established dominance in the older male division, moving from turf to dirt to win both the Hal’s Hope (G3) and Donn Handicap (G1). Melnyk Racing Stables’ Lukes Alley took down the Gulfstream Park Turf Handicap (G1).\nCash is King LLC’s Cathryn Sophia registered a pair of dazzling triumphs, overwhelming her 3-year-old filly rivals by 5 ½ lengths in the Forward Gal (G2) and by 7 lengths in the Davona Dale (G2). Gary Barber and partners’ Catch A Glimpse, the 2015 Eclipse Award-winning juvenile turf filly, made a stunning 2016 debut, capturing the Herecomesthebride (G3) by 2 ½-lengths for trainer Mark Casse.\nRockingham Ranch and Gelfenstein Farm’s X Y Jet was the only three-time stakes winner at the meeting, establishing sprinting dominance with triumphs in the Sunshine Millions Sprint, Gulfstream Park Sprint (G3) and Mr. Prospector (G3).\nTodd Pletcher continued his domination among trainers, capturing his 13th consecutive Championship Meet title with 62 visits to the winner’ circle. Javier Castellano collected his fifth straight jockey title with 113 winners. Ken and Sarah Ramsey topped the owner standings for fourth consecutive season with 29 winners.\nSource: Gulfstream Park\nThe Racing Dudes preview and give picks for the $400,000… Read More\nThe Magic Mike Show guys preview & give their tickets… Read More\nThe Racing Dudes preview and give picks for the $1.25… Read More\nAaron and Papa Dude take a look at the Rebel… Read More\nGet the 2024 Fountain of Youth Betting Bible, featuring our EXACT race-by-race… Read More\nAaron previews the 2024 Fountain of Youth Stakes (G2) from… Read More\nAaron previews the 2024 Gotham Stakes (G3) from Aqueduct Racetrack,… Read More\nLooking to cash in big?\nSign up for exclusive 10% discount on orders, plus be the first to access our daily free and premium horse racing picks, articles, podcasts, and more!", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}
{"id": "7776", "text": "Section: Overall Objectives\nThe research conducted in MuTant is devoted both to leveraging capabilities of musical interactions between humans and computers, and to the development of tools to foster the authoring of interaction and time in computer music. Our research program departs from Interactive music systems for computer music composition and performance introduced in mid-1980s at Ircam. Within this paradigm, the computer is brought into the cycle of musical creation as an intelligent performer  and equipped with a listening machine  capable of analyzing, coordinating and anticipating its own and other musicians' actions within a musically coherent and synchronous context. Figure 1 illustrates this paradigm. The use of Interactive Music Systems have become universal ever since and their practice has not ceased to nourish multidisciplinary research. From a research perspective, an interactive music systems deals with two problems: realtime machine listening  ,  or music information retrieval from musicians on stage, and music programming paradigms  ,  reactive to the realtime recognition and extraction. Whereas each field has generated subsequent literature, few attempts have been made to address the global problem by putting the two domains in direct interaction.\nIn modern practices, the computer's role goes beyond rendering pre-recorded accompaniments and is replaced by concurrent, synchronous and realtime programs defined during the compositional phase by artists and programmers. This context is commonly referred to as Machine Musicianship where the computer does not blindly follow the human but instead has a high degree of musical autonomy and competence. In this project, we aim at developing computer systems and language to support real-time intelligent behavior for such interactions.\nMuTant's research proposal lies at the intersection and union of two themes, often considered as disjoint but inseparable within a musical context:", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}
{"id": "7791", "text": "Looking back, I would describe my childhood as a testosterone fueled madhouse. I’m the oldest of four boys, the son of a father with three brothers. Days were spent in intense physical struggle as three boys literally wrestled for dominance. I pursued a lot of typical male hobbies, like sports and building, read about typical male interests like history and computers. These days, I’m the dad of three boys of my own and I see the exact behaviors in my own children.\nSo when I started tearing up when I saw this commercial in my father-in-law’s basement during a certain football game, it was a surprise even to me.\nI’ve been a feminist since I was about 10 years old when I first encountered the term. I think, as someone who was bullied and outcast from an early age, often by other outcasts to boot, I’ve developed a very strong reaction against any kind of belittling. So when I hear someone doubt and make fun of someone just because they are female, I get upset.\nReal Men are Feminists\nIn my life, despite plenty of male role models, I’ve always gravitated to women who are strong. I think of my mom who felt compelled to become an at home mom, but ended up graduating college in later years with a GPA that would make most people jealous. And of course I am constantly inspired by my wife, who often times doesn’t realize that she is doing anything extraordinary because she decided early on that she would refuse to hear “no”.\nI often think of how many amazing women with limitless potential are stymied by a culture that does not value them because they are female, or that does not encourage them to pursue their talents because of an antiquated idea about gender roles. We hear all the time about those pioneers who exceeded the expectations of their day, but it’s a bit chilling to me to think of all the talent that was left behind because they had just a tad less force of will. How many other Hypatia of Alexandrias or Hedy Lamarrs did we leave behind?\nAnd in the wake of a string of anti–feminist, anti–women incidents, I’m concerned that there’s a growing movement to throw women back into “their place”. I find that to be repugnant. It seems the tactic of these groups is brutal violence or brutal speech in an attempt to intimidate people into silence. People really seem to hate it when women speak, don’t they?\nThe Unfortunate Truth\nWhile I’m not a father of daughters (true story: although we cannot imagine it now, Stacy and I both wanted girls before Cole was born but realized it was unlikely given my family history), I do have boys that are learning how to treat women one day, and I’ve tried my best by both words and deeds to show them not to ever consider girls to be lesser. After all, they have their mother as an example. Unfortunately, a lot of sexism runs so deep we don’t notice it.\nThe fact is that most people don’t realize what they’re doing is harmful. Like when they asked the boy in the video about whether he was making fun of all girls and he had a moment where he realized he was implicating his sister, on accident. Most people aren’t trying to insult the women they know, it’s those other women! But every time you say something about a whole gender, you are wounding them. I know from experience how much it can hurt to be told you’re not good enough or worthy enough, and we do that to girls and women every day.\nWomen in Paleo\nFive years ago there was only one or two women in the paleo movement with any sort of popularity. Today, they outnumber the men! I remember, though, a moment 2 1/2 years ago when someone commented and set off a bit of a controversy about the women of Paleo. Stacy has caught a lot of flack from people about her size, goals, and dedication to the lifestyle, but the topic is constantly coming up and having to be addressed. To me, it’s just another example of people telling people they’re just not good enough. After all, it’s not like all the male leaders in paleo are that lean, a fact I’m reminded of every morning when I look in the mirror.\nAnother example is reviews of female paleo podcasts: The Paleo View, Balanced Bites, and Everyday Paleo. In each case, there are many negative reviews that simply state that they cannot take the hosts seriously due to the use of uptalk in their speech patterns. Mind you, Robb Wolf does the same thing. There’s a significant number of people who have decided that speech patterns or vocal inflections (the most recent bugaboo is “vocal fry”) are what explains the fact that they are unable to see a woman as a voice of authority. Likely these people have no idea the statement of sexism they’re making, because it’s just engrained in them to not like something – without wondering why.\nBe the Change You Wish to See\nAnd there’s the role model problem in entertainment. As a man, I have no shortage of other men being portrayed as heroic and worthy leaders anywhere I turn. But it takes flukes to get people to realize that girls want that for themselves, too. Why was Frozen a surprise? Why did they go right back into production on more boy-centered movies right after? Bridesmaids was a hit. Where are all the female centered comedies? And why when they try something new is the male response “STOP RUINING MY CHILDHOOD!“?\nThe hardest thing to do in life is change how you unconsciously act. It’s even harder to change the way people have been acting for thousands of years. But I’m starting with my boys, who are learning that words have power. And with great power comes the great responsibility to shape what message people hear.", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}
{"id": "7805", "text": "Doctor of Philosophy (PhD)\nVeterinary Medical Sciences - Pathobiological Sciences\nThe outer surface lipoprotein (osp) layer forms an interface between the internal and the external environment of the Lyme disease spirochete, Borrelia burgdorferi. The homeostatic maintenance of the osp layer effectuates adaptation of B. burgdorferi as it gets transmitted from the tick vector to a mammalian host and vice-versa. However, the regulation of the outer surface lipoproteins (osps) is still a conundrum for borrelia scientists. Part of this dissertation inquires about the homeostatic maintenance of the osp layer. We found that the deletion of the dominantly expressed tick phase osp, OspA, induces expression of two other osps. OspD, and BBJ41. Also, increased expression of OspC was seen in borrelia mutants lacking OspA, OspD, and BBJ41. These results suggest constant osp layer maintenance, irrespective of the presence or the absence of the dominant Osps, like OspA and OspC. Furthermore, our conclusive electron microscopic study demonstrates that the overall density of the osp layer remains identical in wild type and mutant B. burgdorferi, lacking either several osps or the dominantly expressed OspA. OspA is abundantly expressed on the borrelial surface as it persists in an unfed tick. A blood meal causes rapid downregulation of OspA as B.burgdorferi prepares to infect the mammalian host. The downregulation of OspA is speculated to be regulated by an unknown repressor protein. The remaining part of this dissertation pertains to the investigation of this unknown repressor protein for ospA. The borrelia oxidative stress regulator protein, BosR, has been attributed with an indirect role in OspA downregulation. However, due to its homolgy with a family of transcriptional repressors, BosR is more likely to cause direct repression of OspA. Therefore, we investigated the direct interaction of BosR and the ospA regulatory region. The DNA binding experiments demonstrated that borrelia oxidative stress regulator, BosR, binds directly to the cisI and cisII regulatory regions of ospA promoter. Thus, conclusively, BosR acts as a repressor protein which causes OspA downregulation in B. burgdorferi.\nDocument Availability at the Time of Submission\nRelease the entire work immediately for access worldwide.\nDadhwal, Poonam, \"Outer Surface Lipoprotein Layer Homeostasis and Gene Regulation in Borrelia burgdorferi\" (2014).

{"id": "7811", "text": "There is a bricolage of competing local and global ideologies, value systems, and practices vying for the attention of urban South Asian consumers. We term this as “postmodern complexity”. Drawing from a three-year ethnographic research expedition on Sinhalese Sri Lankan families, we illustrate the process by which these families mediate postmodern complexity during new family formation. Our findings support an emergent framework to understand the processes in which families negotiate the influence of competing discourses and illustrate that the process is a perpetual experimentation spanning across three overlapping stages. We argue that negotiating postmodern complexity in our families is a hybrid and creolised resolution that is tailored to each family’s unique identity needs. Families can draw from a multitude of meanings that are anchored in consumption in order to create a unique family identity that is most appropriate to their identity pursuits.", "scores": {"score": 0, "score_transform_1": 0, "score_transform_2": 0, "score_transform_3": 1}}

{"id": "7824", "text": "The internet largely agrees that attraction and engagement plans are two of the most important things that you can develop to create a sustainable business, right now.\nA big part of that strategy for most businesses begins with a downloadable PDF, because as a business owner, you recognize that your time is finite and that you need a scalable way to attract, engage, and nurture budding customer relationships.\nAccording to a 2017 study from Episerver, 9 out of 10 people aren’t going to buy something the first time they visit a website, even if they went there JUST TO BUY SOMETHING. Additionally, 32% of those same people will never make a purchase.\nWhen is the last time you bought a service from a company without really knowing who they are and what they’re about?\nBut does your pink spoon HAVE to be a pdf?\nSigns point to no and here’s why:\nReason 1. PDFs aren’t digital.\nI get it. PDFs are easy to make! All you need is access to a word processor and “Save as” to convey your thoughts and ideas pretty quickly.\nThat said, providing people with a PDF is, essentially, just giving them a piece of paper in the digital space. A PDF that, once delivered is just there… incapable of providing the end-user with an experience.\nReason 2. No feedback loop.\nYour audience has the information – now what? If your free sample has an actionable purpose, you’ll find that you can prompt people to do things, but other than that PDFs are mostly cosmetic and don’t make a great medium to lead people back to you.\nThe whole point of signing up for email marketing and figuring out how to make a link that people can use to download that thing and all the other things you created around this content is to nurture your relationship by engaging with those people. A couple of hyperlinks (if you’ve got some in there) aren’t encouraging that.\nReason 3. You actually like your people.\nThe idea of delayed gratification is lost on most of the internet. Content creators, in particular, bow to this perceived need for immediacy by making sure that “Get it now!” is an incredibly literal phrase\n— BUT —\nYour opt-in is a free sample of your business. Delivery of a product or service, i.e. doing business, is all about moving nouns (people, places, & things) from one state to another.\nIf you run a restaurant you move people from hungry to fed. Giving them a free sample of the food still puts food in their mouths.\nYou like your potential customers so you’re not going to give them an excuse to use up some ink, fill their trash (digital and physical) with more paper, or give them questions or checkboxes that they can’t complete.\nOther strategies for your free sample\n1. Send people to a web page.\nThis page [the one you’re reading now] is publicly available on the internet. I have it set to non-index, meaning you can’t just google it, but if you have the link, you can visit anytime.\nTHE WORKFLOW ⇒\n- Create a page and set it to NOT be indexed by search engines like Google, et al.\n- Create your subscriber sign-up form with a nice call to action\n- Set the form to redirect to the page when the user signs up\nONE MORE THING (optional, but a great idea)\nSet up an email to automatically go out to new subscribers with the same link and an additional call-to-action to discuss their thoughts with you!\n2. Share a private podcast.\nI HIGHLY suggest this for people who already have a podcast, or whose work is largely coaching and facilitation-based.\nTHREE (3) WAYS ⇒\n- Tools like Hello Audio make it easy because you can use Zapier to automatically give people access (and take it away) when they use your subscriber form.\n- You can use CloudApp, Zoom, or Loom to record, download the recording (audio and/or video) and just send them a link to a public file in Dropbox, or Google Drive.\n- Another great idea for a LIVE version of this is to send new subscribers an invite to a closed Clubhouse room!\n3.

If you’re not familiar, allow me to introduce you to a power tool that I love 🥰 It’s called Notion 💡 and Notion is a versatile and freemium online tool for creators that is kinda like old-school, pre-ribbon Microsoft decided to merge Word, Excel, and Access into one program AND make it easy to use 🤯\nHere are the opt-in use-cases that I can think of in the next few minutes that would get an automatic, “use Notion” from me:\nWith Notion, you don’t need to be a web developer, or even very tech-savvy in order to create online pages with whatever mix of content types that you desire and I can’t recommend it enough!\nClick the link below and opt into my audience if you’d like me to show you how to use Notion to take over the world.\nGood if you are. . .\n- not familiar with, or are curious about Notion OR\n- just want more info on free stuff that you can start using now to build your empire OR\n- wanna snag your copy of my opt-in planner today\nFinal thoughts.

But a girl from Honduras is very difficult to meet a foreigner on the streets of his native city because their home country does not belong to the tourist. Men from other countries very rarely come here, so the chances of getting to know such a guy are minimal.\nIn this situation, dating sites are very helpful, thanks to which Honduran girls want to make their dream come true. There is no link to the territory online – wherever you are, you can always keep in touch. This is the main reason why mail order Honduran girls are so popular and have high ratings on the site.\nIn this situation, dating sites are very helpful, thanks to which Honduran girls want to make their dream come true.

Thanks to this, the girls who live here have a high level of prosperity.\nIn real life, you can meet a woman who works or works in a prestigious company. Also, Honduran women have a large dowry from their parents, which is transmitted after marriage. They do not set a goal to find a husband for the sake of a lot of money. These are all stereotypes and myths that exist in society.\nThey don’t want to live in another country\nThere is a stereotype that Honduran girls register on a dating site in order to change their place of residence and move to another country. In most cases, this judgment does not correspond to reality. In this country, the conditions for comfortable living, working and development.\nHonduran women are very family-loved – it is true. Love for the family, affection for the native city is rooted in the culture of the local people. Very often, girls legal live with their parents until marriage. They like to organize holiday parties with their loved ones and respect family traditions. Therefore, to move to another country to live there is a difficult decision for any girl.\nFor the first meeting, we recommend that you yourself come to the girl’s hometown. You can learn more about her, meet her family and friends. And the question of where you live together, you can always decide.\nWhy Honduran brides for marriage are so popular among foreigners?\nWe can bring several important advantages that distinguish Honduran girls compared to others and make them enviable brides.

A very good match is a pair between a Honduran girl and a European man.\nInternational marriages are becoming more and more popular every year. There are several reasons for this. First of all, this is due to the fact that we are interested in communicating with people of a different mentality, another world outlook. This is evidenced by statistics: the number of divorces among such couples is minimal.\nSexy Honduran woman is a girl coming from dreams\nThese girls are also very emotional and charismatic. They are open and not afraid to show their feelings. They love to dance, sing and have fun. With such a girl is easy. If they are happy – they dance or sing and are not shy about their real emotions. They are also very feminine and always ready to support a man in difficult times.

The C360 also is compatible with common commercial UAS systems, which allows operators to fly the C360 into a scene to perform hazard assessments in real time.\n“By deploying a chemical detector on drones and ground robots, industrial managers can identify dangerous situations from a safe distance, keeping operators out of harm’s way and speeding corrective measures,” said Dr. David Cullin, vice president and general manager of Unmanned and Integrated Solutions at Teledyne FLIR Defense. “We’re pleased to be teaming with MFE to provide innovative technology solutions like MUVE C360 that put distance between good people and bad things.”\n“Being able to utilize the FLIR MUVE C360 on Boston Dynamics’ Spot and commonly used UAS systems for inspection make this payload one of the most versatile sensors we have in our toolbox today,” said Jason Acerbi, general manager at MFE Inspection Solutions. “Whether during day-to-day checks or an emergency response event, our clients take air quality monitoring seriously, from ground level to the tallest assets inside an oil and gas facility.”\nMUVE C360 delivers continuous threat information in real-time and is fully integrated with commonly used enterprise UAS platforms, including the Teledyne FLIR SkyRanger™ which offers secure data communications for defense and homeland security applications as well as unmatched flight capabilities. In addition, Teledyne FLIR’s new MUVE C360 Partnership Program offers potential partners the opportunity to become a certified C360 integrator.\nAttendees at the 4C Conference for oil and gas industry professionals, being held in Austin, Texas, April 6-8, can see the MUVE C360 integrated onto Spot and other remote inspection platforms.

In this webinar, our team of experts were joined by educator Kenny Bae from UBTECH Education’s Teacher Ambassador Program (TAP) to share his experience utilizing UKITs in camps and afterschool programs.\nHere were some key takeaways:\n1. Virtual robotics camps brings robotics to kids regardless of classroom situations.\nFacing an unprecedented educational climate during the pandemic, UBTECH Education launched Camp:ASPIRE. This unique program is standards-based and centers around the engineering design process so learners from all backgrounds and experience levels can experiment with robotics and learn STEM concepts.\n2. Robotics outside of class offers a low-stakes environment where your students can take risks and thrive.\nTAP educator Kenny Bae has a wealth of knowledge and advice on how to create a meaningful program for students. He and his students even did something cool (and useful) with robotics during the COVID-19 pandemic! Using parts and pieces from UKITs, they created a prototype of a portable ventilator, which challenged his students to apply their learning to developing real life applications.\n3. Robotics projects can open up doors and lead to grant and donation opportunities.\nBy increasing exposure for his students’ projects, Kenny Bae received grants from the likes of Disney, Home Depot, Coca-Cola, and more!\nAs Mr. Bae says, it’s all about the students: “All the accolades are wonderful but the main point is that it’s helped us do better for our students.”\nCome explore these topics, a Q&A with the speaker, and more in the Robotics ‘Out of the Classroom’ webinar recording.\nWe explore exciting STEM topics in our monthly webinar series.

Dwarka, situated in Gujarat’s Saurashtra promontory, is essential for the Char Dham journey and one of the seven antiquated urban areas (Sapta Puris). Dwarka, otherwise called Dwaravati, is gotten from the words’ dwara,’ which implies entryway, and ‘ka,’ which alludes to Brahma.\nVisiting Dwarka means you will experience life away from all chaos.

However, research from the Gulf of Cambay’s submerged bed dates this period to between 9,000 and 15,000 years ago, or millennia before the birth of Christ.

The city had 900,000 silver royal palaces studded with emeralds and crystals. Dwarka, interconnected by a complex system of avenues, markets, and temples, was an advanced building, unlike any other era in terms of architecture and design.\nThe Indian Marine Archaeological Unit began conducting underwater investigations near Lothal, the port city of the Harappan civilization, in 1988. S.R. Rao’s archaeologists had been exploring the area and discovered pottery and artifacts that predated the Indus valley civilization. They chose to continue looking for the Dwarka sunken city for this reason.\nAt a depth of about 70 feet below sea level, they discovered sandstone walls, street grids, huge rocks that were once attached to buildings, and copper coins made 9,500 years ago.\nThe Archaeological Survey of India’s discoveries disproved the existence of the mythical city of Dwarka and the age of Indian civilization, which was thought to be only 3,500 years old by western archaeologists. Instead, Dwarka demonstrates that the Mahabharata was an actual historical event and gave Indian culture more age.", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}
{"id": "8108", "text": "As the days get longer and the temperatures get warmer, it's time to start preparing your beard for spring. Whether you're looking to clean up your worn winter look or keep your facial hair looking its best, the right products can make a world of difference. Here are five essential beard products that every man should have this spring.\nA healthy and well-maintained beard is essential for any man looking to make a great impression this spring. While some men may be content with simply washing their beard with regular shampoo, using a dedicated beard shampoo can be the key to making your beard look its best.\nBeard Shampoos are specifically designed to cleanse and nourish facial hair while still being gentle enough to avoid causing irritation or dryness.\nYou should use lukewarm water rather than hot water when washing your beard, as it can strip away natural oils and dry out the skin. Massage a quarter-sized amount of beard shampoo into your wet beard, then rinse thoroughly. Avoid over-washing, as this can strip away too much of your beard's natural oils, leaving it feeling dry and brittle.\nBeard Conditioners are essential for keeping your beard healthy, soft, and manageable in the spring. After shampooing your beard, it's important to properly condition it to absorb moisture and nutrients from the product. A good beard conditioner will help to nourish and protect your facial hair while also helping to prevent breakage and split ends. When choosing a conditioner, look for a product specifically designed for facial hair, as this will help ensure you get the best results.\nBeard Oil is a must-have for any bearded man who wants to take good care of his facial hair. It helps keep your beard soft, moisturized, and looking its best. This essential product is made from a mix of carrier oils like jojoba oil, argan oil, almond oil, and vitamin E oil that combine to create a nourishing blend that won't leave your beard feeling greasy or weighed down.\nTry a scented beard oil available in various natural fragrances like sandalwood, pine and cedar, and clary sage for extra scent. You'll want to massage the oil into your skin to penetrate and nourish your hair follicles and provide some hydration to your skin. When using beard oil, starting with a few drops is essential, then adding more as needed.\nBeard Balm is a great way to protect your beard from the elements during the spring season. It helps condition, soften, and hydrate your facial hair while providing a light hold for styling. This product is a must-have for those looking to maintain their beard's health and shape.\nA quality beard balm will help condition the skin underneath your facial hair, which can become dry and irritated from the sun and wind during the warmer months. The product can be applied to wet or dry hair, typically in a small tin for easy application.\nBeard balm is an essential product to add to your grooming routine this spring. Whether you have a long or short beard, this product will help keep your facial hair healthy, soft, and looking its best.\nBeard Wax is an excellent option for those looking to achieve maximum control and styling of their facial hair. A good beard wax will provide a firm hold that's not too stiff or greasy and help keep your beard in place all day. The wax can also nourish the hair follicles, helping keep the skin beneath your beard healthy and free from irritation.\nSimply massage a small amount of wax into your beard in the direction of the hair growth and then shape it as desired.", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

It is that time of the year again when business owners and employees are keeping their fingers crossed that they will get an income tax refund. But before that, the correct filing should be done first. If you only have one source of income, it may be a little bit easier. However, if you have multiple incomes no matter if you are in the country or not, the process can be tricky because it would definitely involve tons of paperwork. This is why a lot of taxpayers hire tax preparers or lawyers to assist them. Check car accident lawyers nyc and get to know the best firm that you can go to – IRSMedic.\nIt is true that tax preparers can help in filing your taxes, but you have to remember that hiring one is not always an assurance that the process will go smoothly. What you really need is someone who has a proper educational background and experience with tax preparation, filing, as well as other related issues. And so, instead of looking for a tax preparer, you should hire a tax attorney. When you have a lawyer to help you with your taxes, you will have a higher chance of making the process right the first time.\nIRSMedic is a firm that has helped thousands of taxpayers not only in the preparation and filing of their taxes, but also in some other tax problems that may involve non-compliance or tax evasion. Additionally, they are extending their help to all concerned US citizens including those who have decided to work and reside outside the country. You may be wondering why this particular group of lawyers is offering their help to the Americans that are not in the US. It is because, all US citizens that are making money, regardless what and where their incoming is coming from, are required to pay their duties to the IRS. Even if they are no longer living in the states, and they are working for a company outside the US, by law, they are still obliged to pay taxes in their own country.\nWhat can IRSMedic do?\nIRSMedic is a group of well-experienced tax lawyers. They have been helping US citizens for quite a long time now especially those who are in distress because they are faced with some serious tax issues. The US has a very complex tax code.

The Left’s latest victory is suspending graduation testing requirements in Oregon.\nSenate Bill 744, passed along partisan lines by a Democratic supermajority in the state legislature, suspends basic skills tests in mathematics, reading, and writing. For students to graduate, they must pass these tests.\nDemocratic Gov. Kate Brown signed the bill into law in August and these tests are suspended until the 2022-2023 school year. Although these tests were placed on hold during the coronavirus pandemic, it was expected that these tests would resume once the pandemic ended.\nOregon’s Department of Education claimed that the new law will permit state education bureaucrats to create equitable graduation requirements, which involves comparison of Oregon’s standards to other states. Another part of their work will include methods to reduce disparities among its students while ensuring that the graduation requirements are fair to all students.\nOne activist, Rashelle Chase of Mxm Bloc, told the Associated Press that the graduation exams harmed racial minorities, special needs students, early language learners and low-income students. Chase said, “Under the best of circumstances, in totally normal times with no pandemic, there are a number of children who don’t test well.”\nMxm Bloc is an activist group that focuses on education and social justice issues, which is Leftist code for left-wing activism. There is no active, publicly-available site for the group, which is typical of secretive, Leftist groups. Also, the group is a loud supporter of Black Lives Matter and helped organized at least one sit-in protest in Portland, Oregon.\nFor years, the Left defined equality in education in ways such as lowering education standards and testing criteria, abolishing valedictorian status for high-achieving students, and enacting affirmative action policies which tend to exclude Asian-Americans and white Americans.

While the Tampa Port is home to several cruise ship sailings - Holland America, Norwegian, Carnival, etc., the area allotted to Carnival check-ins is not the best.\nCompared to Miami, the Carnival check-in area in Tampa is relatively small. Cruise passengers stretched outside in the line.\nThe line moved at a relatively fair pace, but it still appeared that the trip from outside to the check-in counter took longer than elsewhere.\nAnyway, that is all minor. After you get past the check-in counter, it is time for the pre-boarding photo with the family and then onto the ship.\nI love Paradise's decor!\nThe ship is beautifully designed. Upon boarding Carnival Paradise, you will enter the Empress Deck (Deck 7), the ground level of the atrium.\nLook up and be amazed by the atrium! Such a spectacular sight!\nThe main boarding area contains Guest Services, the Shore Excursion Desk, a bar with a pianist and comfortable seating on both sides.\nI was ready to just hang out and relax right there. However, there was much more to see!\nI have come to expect the best in dining options on cruise ships and was not disappointed. In addition to the two main dining rooms - Elation Dining and Destiny Dining Rooms - Carnival Paradise offers (like all other ships) buffet dining. This was on the lido deck in the Paris Restaurant.\nThe cuisine choices in the Paris Restaurant were most welcoming. There was the All American cuisine, Italian cuisine, French cuisine, Caribbean cuisine, a deli option and Asian cuisine (not all at once).\nIn addition, there was a grill option always going on and a rotisserie section. I believe there was something for just about everyone!\nFor those who chose a waiter-appointed four course dining (we did for dinner each evening), the menu offered some classic options plus new items every evening!\nI believe that being pampered is one reason so many people love to cruise. We were quite pleased with our cabin stewards' efforts to remember all our names - even when I had trouble pronouncing theirs.\nYou will find that most cruise ship crew members are from many countries around the world. Our cabin stewards were from Indonesia.\nWe chose \"Your Time Dining\" for dinner (anytime between 5:45 and 9:30) and was impressed with one main waiter who remembered my name for the duration of the cruise, even though we were only served by his team one evening.\nI could not end talking about Carnival Paradise crew without mentioning the guys and gals who work in the buffet restaurant. They were quick to clean up after us (yes, I know they were doing their jobs) and ensured there were enough available tables for the vast number of cruise passengers converging on the dining room at meal times.\nKudos to all the crew members!\nOur Cruise Director on Carnival Paradise was \"Sparkles\", who really sparkled.\nShe was ably assisted by \"Island Girl\", \"Sassy Cassy\" and others. You know that staff members onboard any cruise ship push certain things to get you to spend - such as bingo, gift shop sales and art auctions - however, they also did an excellent job getting people involved, and keeping them entertained.\nSo, whether it was the hairiest chest game, the marriage game or the best cocktail game, there were various activities designed to get as many cruise passengers as possible engaged and having fun.\nThe Paradise currently offers 4-day cruises from Tampa to Cozumel or Havana, Cuba; 5-day cruises from Tampa to Key West and Cozumel or Key West and Havana; and limited longer cruises that include Grand Cayman.\nIn 2012, the 5-day option was to Grand Cayman and Cozumel. This itinerary was once offered by Carnival Sensation (our first cruise ship experience).\nWe enjoyed both ports of call on our first cruise in 2004 and it was good to be back in 2012.\nIn Grand Cayman, we toured the island and then visited Rum Point Beach. In Cozumel, we toured half of the island and then visited the Ocean Beach.\nGrand Cayman is always a treat! The water is clear and beautiful and there are many fun activities to do. The same is true for Cozumel.\nHowever, on this trip we stopped at a beach that was not pleasant. It was a rough sea day and may have accounted for the mixing of water and dirt, because the beach water was \"dirty.\" Luckily, this beach club had a pool and hot tub, so we spent our time there.\nThe beach was quite disappointing, because Cozumel is known for great beaches.\nOne of the most disappointing things about our cruise was the \"past guest\" appreciation experience. Generally, there is a reception held in the main lounge (theater) and free drinks and snack items are served.\nOn this cruise, past guests were offered a voucher for a free drink. That was fine. However, there were restrictions.\nThe drink could only be had for breakfast or lunch and had to be ordered in one of the dining rooms. We tried to get someone to fill our order elsewhere, but that was unsuccessful.\nUnfortunately, we did not have lunch in the dining rooms and so did not get our \"past guest\" free drinks.\nPutting that sour happening aside, our Carnival Paradise cruise experience was fantastic!\nBelow, fellow guests speak of their Paradise cruise experience.\nIf you have sailed with Carnival Paradise, we would love to hear about it!\nMy family recently sailed on the Paradise and had an overall great experience.

{"id": "8235", "text": "The 2014 Toyota RAV4 is all about utility and delivers a level of multi-purpose use for the family who is going places. The small crossover SUV offers useful space and cargo carrying ability for small families or singles. RAV4 received a major overhaul last year and this week we’re test driving the 2014 RAV4 Limited AWD model ($29,720). This tester comes with a Navigation Package ($785) and the Technology Package ($725).\nWhat’s New for 2014?\nFor the 2014 model year, RAV4 gets a new Technology Package for the Limited model and bundles last year’s blind-spot monitoring system with Rear Cross Traffic Alert with a lane departure alert and auto high-beam control. Otherwise, the 2014 Toyota RAV4 remains unchanged.\nThe RAV4 Limited adds a number of features to make life more comfortable in this small crossover. Limited features Softex trimmed eight-way power-adjustable driver’s seat, heated front seats, backup camera, four-way power front-passenger seat, leather-trimmed steering wheel, leather trimmed shifter lever, push button start, power liftgate and 18-inch alloy wheels.\nGetting inside the RAV4 we can see the upgrades Toyota made to this new generation model. There is a new leather band running the entire length of the dash that effectively breaks up the trim between leather and plastic and makes the cabin feel more expansive. The Limited model adds SofTex (which is a leather substitute) to the sportier seats and it adds a bit more luxury to the cabin. The Limited’s leather-wrapped steering is tilt/telescoping and it’s easy for any driver to get comfortable and to find the perfect driving position.\nThe push button start on the Limited model is a welcome addition as more cars are going to this convenience feature. It’s almost annoying having to dig the keys out of your pocket to insert a key. In the back, second row seating is comfortable with decent legroom (37.2 inches). If you are looking for a third row, you will need to look elsewhere as Toyota dropped the seating option in the RAV4.\nRAV4 shines in utility\nThe Toyota RAV4 is designed for utility and the new generation model gets even more space that allows for excellent storage and cargo-carrying ability. With the rear seats up, you have two additional inches of space compared to the old model (38.4 vs. 36.4 inches). With the second row folded flat, cargo space increases by 0.4-inches, giving it a class-leading total of 73.4-inches. And the new height-adjustable power liftgate makes it easy to load groceries and other cargo when your hands are full.\nThe RAV4 is an ideal vehicle for those who need to carry cargo like a small business owner who has merchandise to pick up and load often. The new liftgate now opens from the top, and Toyota did away with the spare tire on the back. With the seats folded flat, or removed altogether, there is lots of room for cargo. RAV4 has a taller roofline that makes getting taller items in easier. For those who want a recreational vehicle, this small crossover will hold lots of recreation equipment. The roof rails make it ideal for attaching a mountain bike, snowboards or a small canoe.\nOn the road\nOn the road, the 2014 RAV4 is a good commuter vehicle and handles like a small SUV. It’s not a sports model like some of the competition offers, (like the Mazda CX-5) and it doesn’t engage the driver. The 4-wheel independent suspension provides a offers a comfortable smooth ride. RAV4 still uses the same 2.5-liter naturally aspirated four-cylinder engine, producing 176 horsepower and 172 pound-feet of torque. Toyota no longer offers the more powerful V6 option. Fuel economy has been improved, earning an EPA-estimated 22/29 mpg city/highway for a 2014 Toyota RAV4 AWD.\nThe 2.5-liter powerplant comes mated to a 6-speed automatic. Thankfully Toyota updated the gearbox from the outdated 4-speed transmission. The 6-speed automatic uses the last two gears as overdrive for increased fuel-efficiency. The RAV4 has good acceleration in the city, but seemed a bit sluggish at altitude going up I-70. It’s likely due to a revised first and second gear ratio to aid with city fuel efficiency.\nAWD will improve handling\nThe RAV4’s AWD system is not built for off-road use, but works well for most driving situations. It will help aid in handling in wet or dry conditions. It features a Dynamic Torque Control AWD system that effectively manages torque transfer between the front and rear wheels via an electromagnetically controlled coupling. When the front wheels begin to slip, the system automatically increases torque transfer to the rear wheels by up to 50 percent.\nOverall, the 2014 Toyota RAV4 Limited AWD is a comfortable small crossover. Where this vehicle shines is in its useful space and cargo carrying ability. It delivers a level of function, comfort and usability that would suit a small active family or single well. RAV4 features excellent storage and cargo-carrying ability. For those who live in cold climates, the AWD system works good for any adverse weather you might encounter. And if you want more luxury this Limited model provides a bit more comfort.", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}
{"id": "8247", "text": "WASHINGTON (BP) — The wait for what could be a legal transformation of the institution of marriage by the U.S. Supreme Court began at 12:29 p.m. EDT Tuesday (April 28) when oral arguments ended in a case concerning gay marriage.\nOral arguments seemed to indicate the case will end with a closely decided opinion on whether the high court or the states may decide if same-sex marriage should be legalized. In the nearly two and a half hours of arguments, the justices jousted with five lawyers about such issues as changing the ancient meaning of marriage, bestowing dignity on same-sex couples and protecting religious liberty.\nThe justices, who are expected to issue a ruling in late June or early July, have at least three options. They could: (1) Legalize same-sex marriage throughout the country; (2) enable states to maintain their authority to define marriage as only a heterosexual union; or (3) require states to recognize gay marriages from other states without prohibiting them from licensing only male-female marriages. Potentially, the justices also could rule in such a way as to deliver a wider victory for the rights of gays and lesbians.\nAdvocates for biblical, traditional marriage called Wednesday (April 29) for continued prayer for the high court and for preparation for an unfavorable decision.\n“There were some good questions asked at the court yesterday, ones that I hope the justices will take into account, such as why the court should attempt to change an institution that has been understood a certain way for millennia,” said Russell Moore, president of Southern Baptists’ Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission.\n“As we continue to pray for this case prior to the decision, let’s remember, regardless of whether our land’s highest court recognizes the unchangeable or not, the church must hold steadfast and learn to engage a culture with the Gospel in which we cannot assume people share our understanding of marriage,” Moore said in a written statement for Baptist Press.\nJordan Lorence, senior counsel for Alliance Defending Freedom, told BP, “I am urging people to pray. I think we could see the Supreme Court go the wrong way on a 5-4 vote. But it’s not over ’til it’s over.\n“I think it’s going to be a 5-4 vote, with [Associate Justice Anthony] Kennedy deciding whether to impose same-sex marriage on the whole nation or not,” Lorence said.\nBased on the arguments, many observers predicted the justices will divide along ideological lines: The more conservative justices — John Roberts, Antonin Scalia, Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito — in support of the states’ authority to define marriage; the more liberal justices — Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan — in support of a constitutional right to gay marriage. Kennedy, meanwhile, again appears to be the swing vote, but past opinions seem to indicate he will come down on the side of same-sex couples.\nIn the case, the high court is considering two questions: (1) Does the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution require a state “to license a marriage between two people of the same sex?” and (2) does the 14th Amendment require a state “to recognize a marriage between two people of the same sex when their marriage was lawfully licensed and performed out-of-state?”\nIn the opening minutes of oral arguments, Kennedy was one of five justices who posed questions to gay rights lawyer Mary Bonauto about changing the definition of marriage after its long history as only a union of a man and a woman.\n“Millennia” is the word he thinks of when he considers this case, Kennedy said. “I don’t even know how to count the decimals when we talk about millennia. This definition has been with us for millennia. And it — it’s very difficult for the court to say, ‘Oh, well, we — we know better.'”\nYet, Kennedy said there has been “time for the scholars and the commentators and — and the bar and the public to — to engage” regarding same-sex marriage, according to the court’s transcript.\nKennedy also expressed concern about the dignity of same-sex couples in addressing former Michigan Solicitor General John Bursch, who represented the states with traditional marriage laws.\n“Same-sex couples say, ‘Of course, we understand the nobility and the sacredness of [marriage],'” Kennedy said. “It’s dignity-bestowing, and these parties say they want to have that — that same ennoblement.”\nLorence, who was in the courtroom for the arguments, said the denial of dignity argument seems persuasive to Kennedy. He told BP, “Is the Justice Kennedy who’s concerned about changing the definition of something that’s been there for a millennia — is that thought going to prevail in Justice Kennedy’s mind or ‘We have to stop dignity harms?'”\nBursch disagreed with Kennedy, saying, “The marriage institution did not develop to deny dignity or to give second-class status to anyone. It developed to serve purposes that, by their nature, arise from biology,” linking children with their fathers and mothers.\nBonauto, longtime director of the Civil Rights Project at Gay and Lesbian Advocates and Defenders, opened the arguments by telling the justices, “The abiding purpose of the Fourteenth Amendment is to preclude relegating classes of persons to second-tier status. And here we have a whole class of people who are denied the equal right to be able to join in this very extensive government institution that provides protection for families.”\nRoberts questioned her assertion, saying, “You’re not seeking to join the institution; you’re seeking to change what the institution is. The fundamental core of the institution is the opposite-sex relationship, and you want to introduce into it a same-sex relationship.”\nRoberts also expressed misgivings about the Supreme Court making an across-the-board decision on gay marriage. “If you prevail here, there will be no more debate,” he told Bonauto. “People feel very differently about something if they have a chance to vote on it than if it’s imposed on them by — by the courts.”\nU.S. Solicitor General Donald Verrilli, arguing on behalf of same-sex marriage, said of leaving the decision to the states, “It seems much more likely to me that the outcome that we’re going to end up with is something that will approximate the nation as a house divided that we had with de jure racial segregation.”\nSome conservative justices raised religious liberty questions, though the issue was not the focus of the oral arguments.\nAlito asked Verrilli about institutions that refuse to permit gay marriage, citing a 1983 decision in which the Supreme Court upheld the Internal Revenue Service’s revocation of a tax exemption for Bob Jones University, a fundamentalist Christian school in Greenville, S.C.\nThe court “held that a college was not entitled to tax-exempt status if it opposed interracial marriage or interracial dating,” Alito said. “So would the same apply to a university or a college if it opposed same-sex marriage?”\nVerrilli responded, “You know, I — I don’t think I can answer that question without knowing more specifics, but it’s certainly going to be an issue. I — I don’t deny that. I don’t deny that, Justice Alito. It is — it is going to be an issue.”\nVerrilli’s reply “was the most ominous thing that was said,” Lorence said. Unlike the Bob Jones decision, such an action regarding institutions that oppose same-sex marriage would have widespread consequences.\n“You have the wrong doctrinal stance on marriage,” Lorence said, “that means all the Southern Baptist congregations, all the Roman Catholic archdioceses, maybe the Mormons, maybe orthodox Jewish congregations, the Orthodox churches — we’re talking about huge swaths of the religious community … — that would suddenly lose their tax exemptions.”\nThe result would be, he said, churches would have to pay income tax on offerings and members would not receive charitable deductions for their gifts.\n“I wish that it weren’t the case,” Lorence said, “but it probably would be — the reality would be that people would give less because they couldn’t get a charitable contribution deduction on their income tax. And the churches would have to pay income tax on the income and property taxes on the church facilities and property that wouldn’t be exempt. … Every church would not be annihilated, but it would definitely hamper immensely their ability to function.”\nThe arguments took place at a time when same-sex marriage is legal in 37 states and the District of Columbia. The state total nearly triples the 13 states where it was legal in mid-2013. Court rulings have produced legal gay marriage in more than two-thirds of those states.\nThe arguments came in a case, Obergefell v. Hodges, from the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals. In a 2-1 decision in November, it became the first federal appellate court to rule states have the authority to define marriage as only between a man and a woman. Five other appeals courts have invalidated state laws that prohibited gay marriage.\nThe opinion by the Sixth Circuit Court, based in Cincinnati, took place in challenges to laws in Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio and Tennessee — states where voters approved constitutional amendments between 2004 and 2006 that limit marriage to a man and a woman.\nCourts have overwhelmingly issued opinions in favor of gay marriage since the Supreme Court –- in an opinion written by Kennedy — struck down a section of the federal Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) in June 2013, saying it violated “equal protection” under the Constitution by refusing to recognize same-sex marriages. Though the high court refused to say states could not limit marriage to heterosexual couples, most courts have used the decision as a basis for striking down state laws that define marriage as only between a man and a woman.\nHundreds of people gathered April 28 on the sidewalk in front of the Supreme Court building to voice their support for or against same-sex marriage. About 40 minutes into the arguments, a spectator in the courtroom began shouting against same-sex marriage and was taken out.", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}
{"id": "8269", "text": "- Comprehensive maintenance services to sustainably extend the life of critical infrastructure of all INEOS FPS operating assets\n- Continuation of long-term partnership with new 3-year contract with extension options\n- Around 130 Bilfinger employees daily on site\nGrangemouth, UK. Bilfinger has been awarded a large-scale maintenance contract by INEOS FPS. The aim of the contract is to ensure the reliability of the critical Forties Pipeline System (FPS), which transports and processes oil and gas from the North Sea. The 3-year contract with an option of a further 2-year extension marks the continuation of a long-standing partnership that has existed for over a decade.\nUnder the agreement, Bilfinger will provide access, insulation, coating and fireproofing services for projects as well as maintenance work for both the onshore and offshore facilities of the 169-kilometer pipeline system.

Bilfinger's drive for continuous improvement and its ability to respond flexibly to our priorities and strategic objectives have been key contributors,” says Ewan MacAngus Operations Director of INEOS FPS.\nAs a strategic partner to the process industry, Bilfinger is a driving force in the industry's transition to greater efficiency and sustainability in existing plants and new technologies. With more than 60 years of experience in the oil and gas industry the Group offers comprehensive services for the entire life cycle of onshore and offshore facilities from a single source.", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}
{"id": "8273", "text": "The Holy Archangels monastery is located in the gorge of the river Bistrica, some 2,5 km from the city of Prizren. The monastery was founded by Emperor Dušan, who endowed it with numerous gifts and estates. The katholikon of the monastery served as the mausoleum of the emperor, whose tomb was discovered in the southwestern part of the nave. It was built in the period between 1343 and 1352. The church was a monumental structure, constructed as a cross-in-square with a large twelve-sided central dome and most probably four ancillary domes. On the eastern side, it had a tripartite sanctuary and a shallow narthex on the western side. Besides the main church, the monastery also had a smaller church dedicated to Saint Nicholas, a refectory, dormitories, fortification walls, and a fortress above the monastery, Višegrad, that was given to the monastery by the emperor.\nAround the middle of the 15th century, upon the arrival of the Ottoman Turks, the monastery suffered devastation when the imperial tomb was looted, and it was almost entirely in ruins, as revealed by contemporary written sources. It was briefly revived but fell into disuse before the middle of the 16th century. In 1615, Sofi Sinan Pasha used the stone from the remnants of the Holy Archangels to build his mosque in Prizren.\nThe first organized archeological excavations at the site of the monastery were carried out in 1927 under the leadership of Radoslav Grujić. The expedition team discovered the tomb with the remains of Emperor Dušan, covered by a white marble slab with a recumbent effigy of the emperor in high relief in the style of western medieval gisants. Other parts of decoration were also brought to light at that time, such as the decorative marble pavement made in the technique of incrustation, fragments of fresco painting, and other pieces of stone sculpture. Almost all of the findings were taken to the museum in Skopje, that was nearest at the time, where most of them are still kept. From 1961 to 1965, additional excavations and conservation works were performed under the guidance of Slobodan Nenadović. From the early 1990s, the initiative to restore the monastery had begun, and the monastic life was revived in the Holy Archangels in 1998. Unfortunately, in 1999 the monastery was under attacks, and in 2004, it was burned down during the March riots. Owing to the efforts of archimandrite Mihailo and his brethren, the monastery is still active today.", "scores": {"score": 3, "score_transform_1": 5, "score_transform_2": 5, "score_transform_3": 0}}
{"id": "8283", "text": "What is a Heat Exchanger?\nThe purpose of a heat exchanger is to transfer heat from one fluid to another, hence the name. In the case of a boiler, this means transferring heat from gas to the water that will be circulating around your home to the radiators and hot water tank.\nNon-condensing units are fitted with just the 1 heat exchanger, whereas modern condensing units have 2, maximising their efficiency and helping to save you money on your energy bills.\nIn this guide, we'll explain exactly what a heat exchanger is, how they work and the possible problems they might encounter.\nWhat is a heat exchanger?\nWhen you turn the heating on, water circulates around the radiators in your home but will only be able to heat the space if it's hot. This is where a heat exchanger comes in.\nGas boilers burn gas, which then heats up and rises towards the heat exchanger that cold water passes through. As the water circulates, the heat is transferred from the gas to the water, which then heats up to effectively warm your radiators or provide hot water for a tank.\nSo, we began with hot gas and cold water but thanks to the heat exchanger, we end up with cooler gas and hotter water without the 2 fluids even having to meet.\nCondensing and non-condensing boiler heat exchangers\nBy law, all new boilers have to be condensing as they're much more efficient than non-condensing units. This is down to condensing boilers having 2 internal heat exchangers, 1 more than their non-condensing counterparts, meaning that they're able to capture and reuse heat from waste gases. Let's take a look at the difference between how these boilers operate.\nNon-condensing units have 1 heat exchanger, which cold water enters to be heated up and then circulates around the home to radiators and the hot water tank. Waste gases are sent outdoors via a flue, which can reach temperatures of up to 250°C, showing just how much heat is being wasted.\nThis isn't a very efficient process, which is why condensing boilers have been made mandatory in the UK. They're better for the environment and your bank balance thanks to having a second heat exchanger.\nCondensing boilers are fitted with 2 main heat exchangers, meaning that they're able to recycle the heat from waste gases, increasing their efficiency.\nTo begin with, cold water enters the secondary chamber, absorbing heat from flue gases that would otherwise be wasted by a non-condensing unit. The water then passes through the primary heat exchanger, warming up further before travelling to the radiators and hot water tanks.\nIt's clear to see just how much difference a second heat exchanger makes by the temperature of the flue. A condensing flue can be 200°C cooler than a non-condensing flue, all of which is being transferred to the water rather than going out into the atmosphere.\nWhy is this a good thing? Simply put, your heating system will be much more efficient which will help to save you money on your energy bills.\nWhat is a boiler flue?\nAs your boiler is in operation, waste gases are produced and need a safe way to leave the building, which is why gas boilers have a boiler flue. It's a white or black pipe or duct, that you'll have seen on the side of homes and building, expelling gas out into the atmosphere.\nDue to these waste gases potentially being harmful, boiler flue regulations are in place to keep you, your home and your neighbours safe.\nCommon boiler heat exchanger problems\nHeat exchangers are an important part of any boiler so in the unlikely event that they come across an issue, it's good to be able to identify it early so that it can quickly resolved. We've highlighted some of the most common boiler heat exchanger problems below.\nIf you're hearing noises similar to a kettle boiling then chances are your heating system is kettling. This is caused when there's a build-up of sludge or limescale on the heat exchanger, restricting the flow of water. This can lead to your system costing more to run and reducing its potential lifetime.\nWe highly recommend getting a professional engineer if your system is kettling, as they'll be able to flush out the system, removing the build-up of deposits and get it working efficiently again.\nAny leaking or dripping from a heat exchanger is most commonly caused by a broken internal component, typically a pump seal or pressure valve.\nWater coming from the pump seal means that it's probably worn out over time and needs to be replaced. Leaking from a pressure valve suggests that the boiler pressure is too high.\nRepairing a broken heat exchanger\nYou shouldn't attempt to repair an issue with your heat exchanger yourself, instead contact a qualified engineer who will be able to safely carry out the work.\nHeat exchanger replacement costs\nIn the case that your boiler's heat exchanger is beyond repair, it will need replacing. A replacement heat exchanger will typically cost between £300 – £500 but this will vary depending on the model. This potential cost is just for the part itself and not inclusive of what the engineer will charge for carrying out the work.\nDifferent engineers will have different prices, which is why we highly recommend getting quotes from several engineers to help you find the best deal. The best way to do this is by completing our simple online form. Provide details of the work you need carrying out and you'll be contacted by up to 3 trusted engineers in your area.", "scores": {"score": 3, "score_transform_1": 5, "score_transform_2": 5, "score_transform_3": 0}}

{"id": "8328", "text": "Evidential Dispensation - a case of 'You too\"?\nToday, the social media sites are frantically covering the announcement of the dismissal of Archbishop McCarrick from the clerical state. After years of alleged inactivity, this announcement on the eve of the imminent summit concerning the Church's response to child sexual abuse, presents as a remarkable coincidence.\nIt comes at a time when senior canonical officials in the CDF and the Signatura have, it is alleged, been singled out for suspicion. One source (La Croix International) headed its report with: \"Senior Canon Lawyer at the Vatican revealed as sexual abuser\". The report identifies Monisgnor Punderson who, it declares, has been included within a \"preliminary list of offenders\" published by the Diocese of Trenton. Elsewhere in the item, it is said that Monsignor Punderson is one 'credibly accused'. This prompts one cleric incardinated in the diocese of Trenton to volunteer the statement: \"I knew him to be an abuser\" He later adds: \"I first heard rumours about Msgr Punderson as a seminarian 36 years ago...\"\nWithin western political history, one is able to discern a pattern of conduct on the part of social commentators. It invariably involves the elevation and adulation of a particular candidate of importance; only to, in due course, to take delight in knocking the same candidate from the pedestal upon which society has in fact positioned him. The media articles to which I have referred, however, display a very different sport altogether. It is one which seemingly has few discernible rules. First: it requires the conflation of suspicion with guilt. This rule is particularly effective in that it removes all of the unnecessary impedimenti such as evidence, burden of proof, presumption of innocence and, most of all: the trial process itself. The second rule is no less important. It distils to a simple and universal principle: all judgments made shall be free from any judicial qualification or accountability. As will be immediately apparent, the rules of this particular sport are apt to generate more than a few injuries. If our supposed sport was marketed as a game for domestic use, it would undoubtedly be given a catchy and pithy name to ensure its place alongside, 'Twister', 'Operation' and 'Monopoly\". The title: \"You too!\" seems a safe contender. It would come in a box with a series of questions; each of which the players are instructed to ignore. To introduce an element of chance, dice would be provided together with a board which included landing squares such as 'suspected' 'accused' 'go to jail' and 'no trial'. If sufficiently popular, a sequel or premium edition would be supplied with additional plastic player tokens (e.g. hyssop stick, jar of vinegar, nails, and sword) and a single piece of perforated cloth, to enable ready division.\nOne might legitimately expect that the completed board game \"You Too\" might be a best seller; a piece of marketing genius. The only possible downside is that it is insufficiently realistic and is unlikely to be able to compete with those who are able to enact these same roles, make the same judgments and determine the fate of others, in precisely the same manner, without the personal cost of purchasing the game (estimated at the broad equivalent of €30).\nBeneath this hypothesis lies a simple truth: the universal law of the Church demands that judgment is capable of being declared in one instance only. Namely: where admissible evidence enables a duly appointed and competent individual to satisfy himself to the point of moral certainty of the matters alleged. These are not matters of personal preference but in fact irreducible minima if the condemnation which the judgment represents and the system in which it was promulgated are to enjoy confidence and be deserving of the term 'Just\".\nThe evils of any form of abuse of power or sexual exploitation are too obvious to require statement. The role and ministry of the canon lawyer is to ensure that accusations are properly made and adjudication properly formulated. Neither is capable of relegation no matter how politically expedient or desirable it might be. Perhaps it is worth calling to mind the wisdom of St Paul VI taken from De Iustitia in Mundo:\n\"Whilst the church is bound to give witness to justice, she recognises that anyone who ventures to speak to people about justice must first be just in their eyes...Within the church, rights must be preserved.\"\nTheodore McCarrick may have exhausted his procedural rights. On the information available, there is nothing to indicate Monsignor Punderson has yet been afforded an opportunity to exercise his. If he is 'credibly accused' it now falls to the Church, drawing upon the legal structures provided for within the Law, to ensure that those accusations are credibly tested and tried. Like the presumption of innocence, these rights cannot be dispensed with.", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

There are limited treatment options for herniated disk pain, but our team at Castro Family Chiropractic can help if you are dealing with this issue. Keep reading to find out if spinal decompression in Norwalk, CA, is right for you.\nUnderstanding a Herniated Disk\nThe spine is made up of many individual vertebrae. Between each of these vertebrae, there is a soft cushion of tissue known as a disk. The purpose of these disks is to cushion the bones so that they do not rub against each other. It is also there to protect the sensitive nerves which lie within the spinal column.\nThese disks can herniate. This means that the outer layer of the disk ruptures and the internal material pushes out through the tear. When this happens, the vertebrae of the spine can start to rub against each other. This can cause a great deal of pain and discomfort.\nSymptoms of Herniated Disk\nIf the herniated disk is located in the upper back or neck, you may experience pain in your arms, hands, and neck. You may also experience tingling sensations throughout your back, arms, and hands.\nIf the herniated disk is located lower in your back, then you may experience pain in your buttocks and down your legs. There may also be tingling or numbness as well.\nWhat Causes a Herniated Disk?\nA disk can herniate due to an injury. Another cause of herniated disks is degenerative disk disease. This is a condition in which the disks simply begin to break down and is common as people age.\nHow Can a Chiropractor Help?\nA chiropractor can provide all-natural treatment options to help you find pain relief. One of the most successful treatment options for this condition is spinal decompression. During a spinal decompression session, you will be placed on a specially designed table. This table applies pressure and gently stretches your spine.\nThis stretching lessens pressure built up between the vertebrae. Once this pressure is relieved, the herniated disks can get the blood, oxygen, and nutrients they need to heal.\nTo learn more about spinal decompression or any of our other services, contact us at Castro Family Chiropractic, serving Norwalk, CA, and the surrounding areas. We now have Spanish appointments available for your convenience.

The council is working with partners to promote some of the grants I'm going to talk about in this column, so it's worth noting that you may receive a letter through the post from our partners with information — look out for the council's logo and if you have any concerns and want to check that a letter is genuine then please give us a call.\nOne of these initiatives is the Government Boiler Upgrade Scheme, through which you could get a grant to cover part of the cost of replacing fossil fuel heating systems with a heat pump or biomass boiler. Fossil fuel heating systems include oil, gas or electric. Your property must have a valid Energy Performance Certificate with no outstanding recommendations for loft or cavity wall insulation to be eligible.\nWarmer Homes can provide a range of fully-funded energy efficiency improvements for your home through the government's Home Upgrade Grant (HUG). Find out more by visiting the Warmer Homes website. The grants are for those on low household income or for those in receipt of means tested benefits and who have a property with an Energy Performance Rating (EPC) of E, F or G. Find an energy certificate for a property by visiting the Government website.\nThe Chichester Warm Homes Initiative is a scheme that we have introduced as a council to help keep people warm. It provides financial assistance for residents on a low income living in a property with poor energy efficiency and for landlords with an eligible tenant. It could contribute towards the installation of an efficient heating system, as well as loft and wall insulation. The maximum assistance is £10,000 for homeowners living in on-gas areas, and up to £25,000 for those in off-gas areas. For more details and to apply, please visit our Chichester District Warm Homes Initiative page.\nThe Energy Company Obligation (ECO) scheme offers grants to low income households and those in vulnerable situations, which can help you insulate your home. You might also be able to get help with replacing an old, inefficient boiler or other heating system. We are working with an energy supplier to start delivering the latest grant shortly, and we will keep you updated on this. If you are in a low income or vulnerable household, you can also contact your energy supplier to ask what support they can give you. To find out which energy suppliers are taking part, visit the ECO supplier contact details page.\nThe government will be introducing a new 'Great British Insulation Scheme' shortly. This will offer more grants to fund insulation for homes in council tax bands A-D. Low income households will be eligible for free insulation and households not on a low income will get insulation at a reduced cost.\nIf you are not eligible for any of the schemes mentioned, there are other ways to access advice. We have created a handy leaflet that summarises all of the different schemes and you can download the Chichester District energy grants leaflet from our website.\nWith bills at an all-time high, knowing how to save energy has never mattered more.

{"id": "8390", "text": "Environmental Goods Agreement: A New Frontier or an Old Stalemate?\nBeginning in July 2014, 18 participants representing 46 members at the World Trade Organization (WTO) launched plurilateral negotiations to reduce tariffs on environmental goods. Negotiations were initiated under the Doha Ministerial Declaration, which called for the “reduction, or, as appropriate, elimination of tariff and non-tariff barriers to environmental goods and services.” The WTO Environmental Goods Agreement (EGA) negotiations followed the 2012 conclusion of an Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) agreement that liberalized tariffs on 54 environmental goods, primarily covering industrial products, such as steam condensers to minimize air pollution and air filtering and purifying machinery. At the time, the original participating countries in WTO negotiations represented 90 percent of trade in environmental goods under negotiation. The effects of a deal would likely be modest, although a new EGA would represent a step in the right direction. Furthermore, it would signal to the global community that the world trading system was capable of tackling climate change within a defined set of rules that could prove useful for more far-reaching changes in the future.\nIn 2016, however, talks collapsed. The most fundamental problem was that negotiators struggled to reach an agreement on what constituted an environmental good and how broadly that definition should extend across various sectors. For example, disagreements persisted around dual use goods, or those that have ambiguous or debatable effects on the environment. Talks were also limited by the structure of the discussions. Negotiations centered around \"categories” of goods as defined by the World Customs Organization’s Harmonized System (HS) codes, as is true with all WTO tariff negotiations. This negotiation used HS-6 codes, which cover categories rather than individual products, leading some countries to claim that the scope of what constituted an environmental good was too broad.\nThe EGA also was criticized for what it failed to include, namely services and non-tariff barriers. Environmental services include infrastructural environmental services, such as wastewater treatment, and non-infrastructure services, such as air pollution mitigation. Arguably, non-tariff barriers (NTBs), such as opaque licensing practices, product standards, and testing procedures, pose more of a limit on trade in environmental goods than tariffs. Limiting the agreement by excluding NTBs and services seemed woefully inadequate to certain countries.\nNegotiations also suffered from lack of participation. Developing countries, except for China and Costa Rica—and eventually Turkey—did not participate, in part because they felt the wealthy countries negotiating had less at stake. The average applied tariff among negotiating countries on goods on the APEC list was around 0.5 percent, meaning APEC countries did not have much to give up, compared with developing countries who had much higher average applied rates. Major economies like Brazil and India did not participate over fears of a spike in cheaper, foreign imports. This dynamic played out during the now infamous EU-China bicycle debacle, in which China wanted to define bicycles as an environmental good, while the Europeans did not.\nAnother more fundamental problem was that two of the participating powerhouses—China and the United States—had their own demands and political pressures, which complicated negotiations. China received significant criticism for making onerous, last-minute demands that would have decreased the number of items covered and changed the rules for determining what constituted a critical mass of countries and products. Indicative of how far China pushed other member states during the negotiations, on December 4, 2016, the last day of the ministerial conference, China arrived with a list of products that significantly diverged from the list that had received near consensus. Cecilia Malmström, who at the time was the European Union’s chief trade commissioner, said the unexpected list of goods from China “made it impossible to find an agreement. We were too far away from each other.\"\nOn the U.S. side, the Obama administration attempted to conclude the deal rapidly during its last months in office, which some experts believed was too much, too quickly. As talks disintegrated, the Trump administration assumed office. The Trump administration never clearly articulated a stance on EGA negotiations and declined to take a leadership role in ongoing negotiations at the WTO. Given complications with Chinese demands, a general lack of agreement on products to cover, and a gap in U.S. leadership, very little progress was made between 2016 and 2021, and there has been limited optimism for negotiations to restart. Furthermore, other pressing issues, such as fishery subsidies and the dispute settlement body, have played increasingly prominent roles within the WTO system, meaning member states may have less bandwidth to focus on restarting EGA negotiations.\nSince taking office, President Biden has demonstrated a dedication to global engagement, and domestic politics could help the Biden administration make headway at the WTO. In 2021, two separate groups of congressional representatives, a group of Republicans and a group of Democrats, officially called on the administration to restart EGA negotiations. U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) Ambassador Tai stated in her congressional hearing that she would “seek stakeholder input in the EGA and assess its consistency with the Build Back Better Agenda.” As the Biden administration builds out its domestic and international agendas, both of which focus heavily on climate change mitigation, and as the European Union and China fine tune their own environmental policies, WTO members have a fresh opportunity to renew EGA negotiations. This paper will assess what went wrong during the initial EGA negotiations and propose a path forward for the international trade community to restart the negotiations.\nEGA Negotiations: A Long History\nThe Doha Ministerial Declaration called for the “reduction, or, as appropriate, elimination of tariff and non-tariff barriers to environmental goods and services.” Initially, negotiators explored the possibility of a multilateral agreement encompassing all WTO members. Within the WTO, open plurilateral agreements are implemented on a most-favored nation (MFN) basis, meaning signatory countries extend tariff cuts to all WTO members, not just the other signatories. In order to prevent freeriding –nonparticipating countries would benefit from other countries’ tariff reductions without making any of their own entry into force of agreements is usually contingent upon participating countries meeting the requirement that they collectively represent at least 80 percent of global trade in goods or services under negotiation, a “critical mass” of world trade.\nAs the Biden administration builds out its domestic and international agendas, both of which focus heavily on climate change mitigation, and as the European Union and China fine tune their own environmental policies, WTO members have a fresh opportunity to renew EGA negotiations.\nFollowing the collapse of the Doha Round in 2008, a swift realization that the EGA negotiations would be far more complex than initially anticipated, and the desire to leverage the successful negotiation of the APEC Environmental Goods Agreement in 2012, EGA negotiators opted instead to pursue a plurilateral negotiation format.\nIn July 2014, 18 participants representing 46 WTO members launched negotiations to reduce tariffs on environmental goods. The EGA ultimately went through 18 rounds of negotiations. As initial negotiations began, participants agreed to structure negotiations around specific categories of environmental goods, such as products for air pollution control and products for environmental remediation. Each round of negotiations covered a specific category. During Round 5 in March 2015, Turkey and Iceland joined negotiations, and countries concluded initial product group nominations. Ensuing rounds of negotiations focused on specific product groups, including identifying which small product groups were controversial. Progress was steady and slow, but talks were reinvigorated in June 2016 after China assumed the G20 presidency. A U.S. negotiator at the time emphasized that China had an ambitious agenda and sought tangible outcomes in trade and environment. U.S. negotiators were quick to leverage Chinese ambition to commit to establishing a timeline for concluding talks, initially set for December 2016. However, talks collapsed in December 2016 and have not been reinitiated.\nAt the time, original participating countries represented roughly 90 percent of trade in environmental goods under negotiation, meaning participants not only met the critical mass threshold but also that the conclusion of a deal would have far-ranging consequences. There was widespread agreement to follow the International Trade Administration’s (ITA) model, which established critical mass of trade at 90 percent of global exports. China, however, wanted critical threshold to include both global exports and imports since that ultimately would have compelled India to join. Participating countries included the United States, the European Union, New Zealand, Australia, and China. India opted not to participate, which allowed negotiations to proceed since countries could meet the threshold without India. Brazil, concerned about the potential implications of an EGA on Brazil’s large ethanol industry, also chose not to participate. Without China, however, negotiating countries would have been unable to meet the 80 percent threshold, and negotiations absent China would have allowed the country to benefit from freeriding on reduced tariffs for environmental goods. In other words, China’s participation in EGA negotiations was critical both to reach critical mass and to prevent China from becoming a free rider.\nSpecial and Differential Treatment and Phase-Ins\nChina's proposal included different phase-in periods for developing countries and would have allowed them to retain tariffs of up to five percent on up to five percent of the products. At the time, this would have provided special treatment to Costa Rica, Turkey, and, most importantly, China. On the other hand, the U.S. proposal for phase-ins followed the 2015 ITA model, which broke down phase-ins into four distinct baskets. Basket One goods would liberalize tariffs upon entry into force of the agreement, eliminating 75 duties on percent of covered tariff lines. Basket Two goods included a three-year phaseout in four equal tariff reductions for products not covered in the first basket. The third basket included a five-year phaseout in six annual reductions to a maximum of 15 percent of covered tariff lines. Basket Four, where China put 40 percent of 201 products, included a seven-year phaseout in eight equal annual tariff reductions to a maximum of five percent of covered tariff lines. In other words, China sought to delay the liberalization of certain goods in which it did not specialize or have a majority market share.\nDefining Environmental Goods\nOECD, APEC, EU, and WTO Definitions\nAn immediate challenge at the outset of negotiations was how to define an environmental good. To date, there is no standard, universally agreed upon definition. However, the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development’s (OECD) 1999 working definition of environmental goods and services is largely regarded as the most complete definition that exists. According to it, environmental goods are those that “measure, prevent, limit, minimize, or correct environmental damage to water, air, and soil, as well as problems related to waste, noise and eco-systems. This includes cleaner technologies, products, and services that reduce environmental risk and minimize pollution and resource use.”\nAt its core, the OECD list was a conceptual exercise in defining environmental goods rather than a practical application of a definition for use in immediate negotiations.\nThe APEC agreement, concluded in 2012, is the world’s preeminent agreement on liberalizing the trade of environmental goods. Much narrower in scope than the OECD’s framing of environmental goods, the APEC agreement ultimately included 54 product categories. The agreement primarily covered industrial products, such as bamboo flooring, steam condensers that minimize air pollution, and filtering and purifying machinery. The goods covered tended to represent interests of developed countries, who are the primary exporters of much of the “end of line” technology included in the APEC list, such as heavy machinery. China, the United States, Australia, and Japan were all signatories to the APEC agreement, accounting for half of the top ten global exporters of environmental goods. Underscoring the difficulty of defining an environmental good, there is only a 30 percent overlap between the OECD list and what was ultimately covered in the APEC agreement. Further, all of the APEC negotiated HS codes were included on the lists of goods negotiated during WTO EGA talks.\nRepresenting yet another approach to defining environmental goods, in 2016 the European Union defined environmental goods as: “Products that directly contribute to environmental protection and climate mitigation by helping clean the air and water, helping manage waste, contributing to energy efficiency, controlling air pollution, and generating renewable energy.”\nThis includes goods ranging from thermostats to polysilicon for solar panels. Highlighting the growing urgency to combat climate change, the EU definition much more explicitly mentions renewable energy compared to the OECD definition. Nevertheless, the stark differences among items deemed “environmental” underscores fundamental problems in how countries approach relevant definitions of goods.\nWith the APEC agreement concluded in 2012, the WTO EGA negotiations that followed in 2014 loosely took into account APEC definitions, although EGA negotiators never conclusively defined what constituted an environmental good. This lack of agreed-upon definition made concluding a deal more difficult since the lack of definitional framework allowed for significant deviation among primary negotiating parties. The initial list under consideration at the WTO was significantly larger at the outset of negotiations. At its largest, the list included 411 products. However, a leaked list from November 2016 ultimately included 304 product lines, and all APEC products were included on that list. The WTO list organized items into 10 sectors based on environmental use:\n- air pollution control\n- cleaner and renewable energy\n- energy efficiency\n- environmental monitoring analysis and assessment\n- environmental remediation and clean-up\n- environmentally preferable products\n- noise and vibration abatement\n- resource efficiency\n- solid and hazardous waste management\n- wastewater management and water treatment.\nThe WTO list substantially expanded environmentally friendly goods, including ones for natural resource protection. For instance, and in contrast to the APEC list, the WTO list includes items like specific kinds of fishing nets with sea turtle excluder devices, made infamous in the 1990s during the WTO Shrimp-Turtle case. In 2016, the United States applied tariff rate for this item was 8.755 percent, the highest among participating OECD countries and higher than China. The WTO list also expanded products under the renewable energy category. Like the APEC list, the WTO list also dealt primarily with components. For instance, solar panels as an end product are not included on the list, but various components are, such as photovoltaic panels and electricity converters.\nA significant difference between the APEC and WTO lists underscores the changing nature of the global environmental goods economy: the treatment of electric vehicles. The APEC list does not directly mention electric vehicles (EVs), while the expanded WTO list includes many components that are critical for EVs, such as the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS) codes covering a specific kind of fuel cell or those covering lithium-ion batteries. Under a renegotiation of the EGA, EVs and their component parts would likely need to be covered. However, the degree to which EVs are beneficial to the environment would likely invite further discussion and perhaps disagreement.\nEnvironmental Implications, Structural Problems, and Omissions\nAnother problem in defining what constitutes an environmental good is to what degree an item actually benefits the environment. For example, one environmental advocacy group found that only sixteen of the nominated tariff lines would legitimately have net beneficial environmental effects, while a majority of covered times would have a neutral effect. Meanwhile, approximately 11 percent of covered items were deemed to have had an explicitly negative environmental impact. Furthermore, biodiversity and environmental costs remain unclear for certain product categories, such as coniferous wood. According to the WTO list, “wood is generally better for the environment than other commonly used building materials in terms of embodied energy, air and water pollution, and greenhouse gas emissions. Wood grows naturally using energy from the sun, is renewable, sustainable and recyclable.” However, deforestation is an increasingly charged topic, particularly in countries like Brazil, where the Amazon is now emitting more carbon than it absorbs. The European Union’s new Forest Strategy, which the European timber industry opposes, aims to plant three billion trees annually in a bid to rehabilitate destroyed forests and capture greenhouse gas emissions. Agreeing to liberalize trade of goods that contradict other domestic and international policies underscores a core tension between trade and climate policy.\nIn addition to definitional problems, structural challenges also emerged around harmonized system tariff codes. HS products typically represent categories rather than specific products. For instance, WTO negotiators included certain kinds of mufflers in negotiations. Mufflers are used in wind turbines to reduce noise – a frequent complaint of people living near wind farms – but can also be used to reduce noise in airplanes. Wind turbines are clearly an environmental good, while airplanes are not. APEC negotiators attempted to rectify this challenge by relying on “ex-outs,” descriptions of a specific product to ensure that the correct tariff is being applied. An ex-out would allow a country to specify that the tariff would only be applied to mufflers being imported for use in airplanes, not in wind turbines. Trade negotiations use six-digit numbers for each product, but many countries tack on additional numbers to their customs schedules to more clearly specify sub-sections of products and to ease implementation for customs officials. However, these add-ons are not harmonized across countries, leading to complexities when it comes to specifying tariff rates. Moreover, ex-outs can also be used to evade tariff limits. For instance, signatories to the APEC agreement agreed to cut tariffs on certain electric motors to five percent or less. These motors, HS-6 850164, are used in wind turbines and other renewable energy sources. However, as of 2019, China maintained a tariff of 10 percent on these motors. While APEC commitments are voluntary, China also maintains a longer, more specific customs code for those products and thus uses an “ex-out” description to clarify which motors are covered. However, their description is different from the description in the APEC agreement, meaning that, according to China, the motors do not fall under the scope of the APEC agreement. However, the 2017 Trade Facilitation Agreement sets out provisions for customs cooperation that seeks to remedy some of these disparities.\nIn addition to persistent disagreement regarding environmental goods definitions, challenges also emerged surrounding what was omitted from negotiations, namely services and non-tariff barriers to environmental goods. Environmental services can include infrastructural environmental services, such as wastewater treatment, and non-infrastructure services, such as air pollution mitigation. The current definition of environmental services is relatively limited and largely based on services that public utilities traditionally provide. Some services, such as engineering services that maintain wind turbines, do not meet the current definition of providing an “environmental service.” Questions also abound as to how far the definition should extend. For instance, it is unclear whether a law firm providing support to a pollution abatement project should be regarded as providing an environmental service. Most environmental services are covered under Article 1, Mode 3 of the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS), which is defined by a commercial presence in another country, such as an environmental consulting firm establishing a subsidiary in a different country. However, there are often restrictions on foreign commercial presences, particularly those providing public utilities. The European Union has local procurement rules for energy, water, and sanitation and public utilities, all of which are environmental services.\nIn 2019, Australia, Canada, Mexico, New Zealand, and Switzerland called for removing barriers to trade in environmental services, in part noting that technological advances have opened significant new opportunities for cross-border trade of services. Currently, 59 of 164 WTO members, including the European Union, have committed to liberalizing trade in environmental services. Therefore, it is likely that a renegotiation of the EGA would need to deal with demands to include environmental services. Furthermore, environmental goods and services are inextricably linked. Goods linked with services such as trash compactors, which often have no use outside of solid-waste management, constitute tethered goods. Additionally, many environmental goods lack value without their associated services. For example, a solar panel means very little if the consumer does not have the ability to install and maintain the panel. The lack of environmental services in the EGA makes it significantly more difficult to liberalize environmental trade, particularly since a physical good absent its companion service represents an incomplete item.\nOvercoming barriers to services liberalization is challenging. Many of the barriers, such as rules limiting foreign ownership of companies, complex visa procedures, and limitations of stay on foreign suppliers are not unique to environmental services and would require countries to overhaul their immigration and incorporation rules. Moreover, some experts argue that non-tariff barriers, such as opaque licensing practices, varying product standards, and testing procedures, limit trade in environmental goods significantly more than tariffs. Therefore, while the inclusion of services and non-tariff barriers to environmental trade may complicate negotiations, their inclusion would more fully capture the entire environmental goods supply chain and barriers to the resiliency of those supply chains.\nWho Did Not Participate\nEGA negotiations were also criticized for the relatively limited number of participants. The only developing countries who participated in negotiations were China and Costa Rica. EGA participants were motivated to negotiate for two primary reasons: they needed access to foreign environmental goods to meet domestic demand and wanted market access for domestically produced environmental goods. Domestic demand and growth positively correlate with high domestic environmental standards that establish a market for green goods. Developing countries often have weaker environmental standards and smaller industries and thus might have lacked motivation to participate. However, the greatest growth potential for environmental goods is in developing countries, and yet developing countries have some of the highest tariff rates on environmental goods. For instance, in 2016, tariffs on fuel cells were low among participating OECD countries, while the tariff rate in developing countries was generally much higher. While China’s fuel cell tariff rate was just 1 percent, both Brazil and India’s were closer to 8 percent, and South Africa’s rate was 11 percent. Brazil, India, and South Africa did not participate in EGA negotiations.\nWhile the inclusion of services and non-tariff barriers to environmental trade may complicate negotiations, their inclusion would more fully capture the entire environmental goods supply chain and barriers to the resiliency of those supply chains.\nThe EGA was negotiated on an MFN basis. Therefore, non-participating countries would benefit from reduced tariffs in participating countries, while failing to liberalize their own tariff schemes. For some countries, this was an incentive not to participate. For example, China was initially reluctant to join the EGA negotiations for fear of competition from cheap imports from India. Meanwhile, India was concerned that cheaper Chinese goods would flood its domestic market, putting local manufacturers out of business. In an analysis of the pros and cons of joining EGA negotiations, India’s Export-Import Bank stated explicitly that India would be able to benefit from freeriding, that most export destinations of Indian green goods were not participants in EGA negotiations, and that joining the EGA would threaten domestic industry in India. The prospect of substantial freeriding concerned a number of the participating countries which led to a debate over the critical mass of participants that would be required.\nEconomic Benefits of Trading Environmental Goods\nVarying definitions make it difficult to quantify the scope of trade of environmental goods. The OECD estimates that between 2003 and 2016, international trade in environmental goods more than doubled and that trade in environmental goods accounts for 8.1 percent of global trade. The market for many environmental goods correlates with countries, who already have robust policies that promote the use of such goods. For example, countries with policies favorable to the large-scale use of solar panels generate increased demand for those products and components, and tariff rates on environmental goods vary accordingly. The U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) estimates that in East Asia, North America, and the European Union, the simple average tariff on environmental goods is 3 percent, with a peak at 7 percent. This contrasts with Southeast Asia and South America, where tariffs on environmental goods average 6 percent and 7 percent with highs of 15 percent and 12 percent, respectively. However, using the narrower list of APEC defined goods, two economists estimated that, as of 2014, high-income countries had an average applied tariff of about 0.5 percent on environmental goods. The broader WTO list had an average tariff rate of 3.4 percent among negotiating countries. Furthermore, average applied tariffs rise as a country’s per capita income decreases, meaning that the conclusion of an agreement on environmental goods would be particularly beneficial to developing countries. Overall, studies estimate that a successful EGA conclusion could increase the value of environmental goods trade by $24 billion.\nTo what degree the EGA offers economic benefits depends both on countries engaged in trade, as well as goods being traded. At the time of the negotiations, the European Commission published a report assessing the impact of the proposed EGA based on the APEC list and a list submitted by a group of nine countries called the “Friends of Environmental Goods.” The report acknowledges that due to the low level of applied tariffs on environmental goods in negotiating countries, an agreement would not likely have a broad macro impact. However, it is possible that an agreement would benefit specific products and countries. For example, China has imposed a 35 percent tariff on biogas water heaters, which an EGA would mitigate. Canada’s impact assessment found that Canadian imports of environmental goods would not increase substantially because Canadian tariffs on relevant goods are already fairly low. However, Canadian exports of environmental goods could increase, particularly to China. Another study found that an agreement on environmental goods would boost Chinese environmental goods exports by 9.8 percent, equal to $27 billion. Furthermore, it is possible that an EGA would also lead to greater Chinese imports of environmental goods and thus boost environmental quality within the country. The International Centre for Trade and Sustainable Development (ICTSD) estimated that U.S. households would benefit from lower energy bills and greater energy efficiency associated with cheaper imports of LED and CFL bulbs, solar control window films, and bicycles. ICTSD estimated that these efficiencies would lead to increased savings of $845 million per year. Overall, countries negotiating the EGA by and large already had low tariff rates on environmental goods, which correlates with stronger domestic environmental policies that encourage the production and use of environmental goods. Nevertheless, the EGA would support additional trade in environmental goods, particularly for specific products with higher tariffs, such as water heaters.\nThe Eleventh Hour: Why Negotiations Collapsed\nAccording to experts interviewed for this project, the primary reasons for the collapse of EGA talks related to definitional differences, changing political factors among member states, and, from the onset of negotiations, a Chinese reluctance to conclude a deal. In December 2016, European Union trade commissioner Cecilia Malmström cited challenges in negotiating with China as the primary reason why negotiators were not able to conclude a deal. In the remaining days of the ministerial meeting, the Chinese surprised counterparts by presenting a new list of products for tariff reduction that substantially diverged from what had been previously discussed and expected. The Chinese list specifically removed gas turbines, certain electric motors, gas controls, and parts of polysilicon solar panels. These sudden Chinese demands supported negotiators’ suspicions that the Chinese had decided they did not want an agreement and that it designed objections in a way that was intended to torpedo talks. Furthermore, the Chinese negotiator at the time was Wang Shouwen, a vice minister. His leadership position in the talks, as opposed to the more senior Commerce Minister Gao Hucheng, led other countries’ negotiators to question the seriousness of Chinese negotiation efforts.\nIn addition to redlining the working items list at the last minute, China also expressed pointed concern about freeriding. The plurilateral format of the EGA would have required that a critical mass of countries trading environmental goods participate in the agreement, which in turn would help mitigate concerns about freeriding. However, negotiators could not agree on where to set the threshold, as both 80 percent and 90 percent were proposed in draft documents. China, supportive of a 90 percent threshold, also proposed a snapback mechanism, meaning countries would be able to revert or “snap back” their tariff cuts if trade of covered products between EGA members dropped below 70 percent of global trade of those products and if at least 3 percent of global trade in the products covered belonged to a WTO member not party to the agreement. This mechanism likely targeted countries like India and Brazil, where domestic green industries are growing, but who did not engage in negotiations.\nTensions also emerged over proposed Chinese tariff phaseouts. Upon implementation, EGA members would be required to phase out tariffs on covered products. The United States called for the majority of tariffs to be eliminated upon entry into force with a capped number of tariffs phased out in three years, five years, and seven years, allocating only 25 percent of covered products into the longer seven-year category. The Chinese, however, demanded that tariff relief occur for 40 percent of all covered products in five- and seven-year phaseouts. Furthermore, the Chinese proposal included special provisions for developing countries. Overall, these Chinese demands were not well received by other negotiators.\nThe European Union, China, and Bicycles\nUnderscoring many of the complexities at the heart of EGA negotiations, one of the most famous conflicts during EGA talks regarded the treatment of bicycles. All interviewees for this project immediately pointed to bicycles as the core issue that led to the collapse of talks—an issue that underscores other persistent areas of disagreement among negotiators. As a zero-carbon form of transportation, bicycles clearly constitute an environmental good. The EU domestic bicycle industry is robust. It employs 90,000 workers across 800 small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), largely concentrated in Portugal, Italy, Germany, Poland, and the Netherlands, which collectively accounted for 70 percent of total EU production in 2019. Issues surrounding bicycle dumping in Europe date to 1991, when the European Union first initiated an anti-dumping investigation against China following a complaint by the European Bicycle Manufacturers Association (EBMA). The European Union did ultimately conclude that China was dumping bicycles, and as a result, in 1993, the European Union imposed a 30.6 percent anti-dumping duty on bicycle imports from China. Since then, that duty has been increased to 48.5 percent in 2019, and it has been renewed until 2024. In other words, EU bicycle manufacturers have benefited from nearly 30 years of high tariffs and are loathe to let them go.\nAn EU Commission report argues that the EU bicycle industry would not have existed without anti-dumping duties, limiting the flexibility with which European negotiators could approach tariff reductions during EGA talks. Ultimately, EGA negotiators focused more on the components of bicycles, such as tires, tubes, chains, valves, and saddles, but complete, non-motorized bicycles were also included on the proposed list. Essentially tanking the negotiations, China proposed the inclusion of all bicycle components and complete bicycles. Australia, Switzerland, Israel, and Taiwan supported the inclusion of a variety of components, while Switzerland also nominated whole bicycles. An EU negotiator stated that the European Union could potentially have been flexible on the bicycle issue, particularly regarding components, had the Chinese been willing to agree on other issues. However, from the Chinese perspective and according to interviewees for this project, the European refusal to designate bicycles as an environmental good amounted to veiled protectionism that significantly reduced their credibility and challenged the earnestness of European efforts to make progress on liberalizing environmental goods for the benefit of the climate. At the time that negotiations stalled, European Union trade commissioner Cecilia Malmström stated that bicycles had become “totemic” for China. Today, China is the world’s largest manufacturer of bicycles, meaning further tariff reductions could result in significant expansion into the EU market.\nDomestic politics in the United States also factored into negotiations. In early 2016, under a working assumption that Hillary Clinton would assume the presidency, the Chinese agreed to participate in negotiations, anticipating a continuation of the Obama administration’s policies. However, during the final negotiating rounds, President Obama was nearing the end of his term, and Hillary Clinton’s lead in the presidential election against Donald Trump was shrinking. In December 2016, observers noted that Chinese political positions shifted after the U.S. election as they sought to capitalize on what was largely regarded as a closing window to conclude negotiations. Between the 17th and final 18th round of negotiations, Donald Trump won the election, leading many negotiators in Geneva to conclude that, if not completely doomed, the window for negotiations was rapidly closing.\nBased on his choice of advisers, as well as strong protectionist campaign rhetoric (Trump regarded efforts to fight climate change as “putting this country at a competitive disadvantage” and referred to climate change as a “hoax”), it was clear to those in Geneva that the incoming president had little appetite to engage in multilateral negotiations, let alone those centered on environmental and climate change mitigation goals. This abrupt political change was especially clear to the Chinese, who had no appetite for renegotiating a deal with the incoming administration, leading some experts to believe that the Chinese purposefully tanked negotiations to avoid having to renegotiate the terms with a new administration. Fears that talks would collapse escalated when the Trump administration assumed office. USTR Ambassador Lighthizer was not interested in negotiating plurilateral tariff cut arrangements, fearful of tariff reciprocity and freeriding among non-parties to the EGA. Furthermore, Lighthizer had long been skeptical about MFN and WTO tariff schedules, and so it was immediately clear to EGA negotiators that he would not restart plurilateral tariff negotiations. However, negotiators disagree about the extent to which China would have been a big winner in an EGA deal. Concerns about handing the Chinese a victory, even a limited one, have carried over from the Trump era to the Biden administration.\nAs calls increase for the global trading community to restart EGA negotiations, it is important to note limits to what WTO member states are able to accomplish. First, it was and remains extremely difficult to define an environmental good. For example, while concrete can be an integral element of a carbon neutral building, concrete production has deleterious effects on the environment. As clearer climate definitions emerge within domestic climate policies, such as specific measurements of methane emissions or the carbon footprint of steel production, this could add pressure to negotiating member states to more clearly consider and define the environmental costs of goods under consideration. In turn, putting a carbon price on goods would likely lead to a drastic reformulation of the original list, setting talks back by several years. Furthermore, a significant outstanding question is whether environmental services should be included in the EGA negotiations. As the current meltdown of recycling supply chains illustrates, lowering tariffs on environmental services, including recycling and repurposing, would help make renewable headway in key industries, from e-waste to methane collection. However, including environmental services in the next round of negotiations may not be worth the associated risk. Determining a list of environmental goods was laborious enough for negotiators, and adding services to the mix may invite further disagreement and slow a process that began over two decades ago.\nAnother complicating factor in negotiations is the 80 percent mandatory threshold. This requirement means that a critical mass of the world’s largest economies—and therefore the countries with some of the most globally connected commercial ties—will need to participate. In other words, China’s participation in negotiations for an MFN agreement is critical. Without China, negotiating parties cannot reach a critical mass. Similarly, the European Union and the United States are also necessary participants, although pursuing a closed plurilateral would obviate the need to meet this critical threshold. However, each country is approaching the EGA negotiations from places of self-interest, considering domestic political considerations that can be a major barrier to flexibility in negotiations, as the EU bicycle case makes clear.\nSolar panels underscore just how complex renegotiating an agreement on environmental goods would be. For example, at face value, solar panels seem like low-hanging fruit; they clearly constitute an environmental good. Serious issues persist regarding the international trade of solar panels. In 2018, 30 percent tariffs were applied to imported solar panels after the ITC found evidence of Chinese dumping. It is difficult to foresee a scenario in which the United States would agree to import tariff-free solar panels from China, particularly following extensive legal and political debates within the U.S. domestic legal system. This one persistent issue alone, which could potentially become the equivalent bicycles dispute in a new round of EGA negotiations, does not portend well for the EGA negotiations.\nAnother complicating factor is the domestic political pressure from coalitions in the United States. Environmental groups have historically opposed trade deals of any kind, regardless of their environmental chapters and clauses. During Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) talks, environmental groups were extremely reluctant to endorse the TPP publicly, despite the inclusion of a state-of-the-art environmental chapter. Similarly, when the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) renegotiations launched, environmental nongovernmental organizations were quick to dismiss the agreement as environmentally harmful and did not endorse the final United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), despite the inclusion of a relatively strong environmental chapter. While the Trump administration disregarded the views of environmentalists, the Biden administration is sympathetic to environmentalist policy preferences and would likely be reluctant to support an agreement that did not meet their approval, potentially complicating an EGA renegotiation.\nWhere EGA Negotiations Stand\nRoom for Optimism\nDespite these obstacles, there is room for optimism when it comes to the potential to jumpstart negotiations. Within the global trading system, there is an urgent desire to demonstrate the relevance of the WTO, where a lack of political will has stymied meaningful action. Facilitating the conclusion of a deal on environmental goods would demonstrate to the global community that the WTO is relevant and capable of fulfilling its core duty of liberalizing trade. Furthermore, concluding a deal on environmental goods would lend credibility to the WTO as an institution attuned to global needs, particularly as trade skeptics point to globalization as having facilitated an environmental race to the bottom. In addition, the growing body of scientific evidence on the human-made causes of climate change, as well as the increasing number of extreme weather events visible worldwide, has lent urgency to the cause of climate change mitigation. An EGA would only be a small step, but it would be an important one to reaffirm the value of the WTO and its ability to address current issues.\nCompared with the EGA, other ongoing environmental discussions within the WTO are orders of magnitude more complex. For example, there is a growing appetite to discuss environmentally harmful subsidies at the WTO, an effort New Zealand is leading. The United Kingdom, Iceland, and Switzerland have also explicitly mentioned environmentally harmful subsidies. While creating binding WTO rules to deal with environmentally harmful subsidies would fine-tune otherwise broad commitments from APEC and the G20, these talks are more complex than relatively simple tariff reductions on a list of goods. Eliminating fossil fuels or agricultural subsidies promises to be a historically contentious issue. Overall, proposals like the European Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) or U.S. procurement related to the domestic climate agenda underscore both the global appetite for fighting climate change but also the complexities of achieving these goals within existing multilateral legal frameworks.\nBy comparison, other environmental initiatives under consideration among specific member states make the EGA seem simple and, therefore, easier to achieve. For example, the European Union’s CBAM proposal has invited considerable backlash from the global trading community, which regards it as an essentially protectionist policy that would shield European manufacturers against cheaper foreign imports. As currently proposed, the CBAM seeks to apply a carbon border tax on imports by sector, targeting cement, iron and steel, aluminum, fertilizers, and electricity. Implementing this proposal in a way that is consistent with WTO nondiscrimination rules is already proving to be a headache for the European Union, whose allies and adversaries alike are preparing WTO litigation strategies. On the United States’ side, the Biden administration’s ambitious climate proposals, coupled with increased content requirements under “Buy American,” could also encounter resistance within the WTO for violation of subsidy rules.\nRecent domestic policies among WTO members, such as the European Union’s CBAM and Chinese emissions trading system (ETS), underscore the growing need for a comprehensive, multilateral approach to climate change. A core competency of the WTO is to facilitate multilateralism and prevent new trade barriers. The recognition that climate change requires a globally coordinated effort is reflected in ongoing plurilateral discussions within the WTO. There are currently 18 participants representing 46 WTO members negotiating on tariff eliminations for environmental goods, but most participants are from developed countries. China, Turkey, and Costa Rica are the only participating countries from developing countries, and no African countries are participating. In an additional indication that talks could potentially move forward, the trade and environmental sustainability structured discussions (TESSD) consists of 53 WTO members, who are working to make progress on environmental measures at the WTO, including on environmental goods, ahead of the November 202 12th Ministerial Conference (MC12). Furthermore, the success of the agreement in APEC demonstrates that multilateral environmental trade agreements can be concluded. In 2021, following the addition of Indonesia, there are 19 APEC members who are fully compliant with the environmental goods provisions. The executive director of the APEC Secretariat hailed APEC’s environmental goods list as “one of APEC’s significant success stories.”\nIn addition to the international consensus around the need to fight climate change, U.S. reengagement in multilateralism could potentially help jumpstart EGA negotiations. In April 2021, President Biden convened 40 world leaders at the Leaders Summit on Climate, which sought multilateral reengagement on combating climate change. Calls to resume EGA negotiations are supported by the likes of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, a group that has historically been slow to endorse major climate change mitigation policies. Overall, the relative simplicity of an agreement on environmental goods tariffs, together with a global consensus on the need to combat climate change, and the desire for multilateral engagement indicate that there is room for optimism regarding a potential renegotiation.\nA Dose of Reality\nDespite a growing urgency to combat climate change and WTO member states’ recognition that trade policies can play an integral role in bringing about positive environmental change, there are several outstanding issues that make the renewal of EGA negotiations difficult, primarily the definitional problems, Chinese reluctance to engage earnestly, a lack of urgency from the United States, and the limited scope of EGA negotiations, all described above. First, definitional problems surrounding environmental goods still persist. It is unlikely that negotiating parties with wide differences would easily reconcile those differences in renewed rounds of negotiations. For example, it is difficult to envision a scenario where China and the United States agree to eliminate tariffs on solar panels, but an EGA that does not cover solar panels would likely face credibility questions. An agreement to eliminate normal duties but where countries would retain the right to impose anti-dumping/countervailing duties in the event of unfair trade practices would address the problem from a trade perspective, but it would leave solar panels more expensive and thus deter growth in their installation.\nMany of the same definitional issues would carry over from the last round of negotiations, but other, newer technologies could further complicate a consensus on environmental definitions. EVs, for example, are becoming much more common than they were during the previous negotiations. Excluding EV component parts from the environmental goods list would reduce EGA significance. At the same time, it is understandable that certain component parts, such as lithium batteries, may not be regarded as particularly environmental, especially among human rights and environmental groups.\nThere are several outstanding issues that make the renewal of EGA negotiations difficult, primarily the definitional problems, Chinese reluctance to engage earnestly, a lack of urgency from the United States, and the limited scope of EGA negotiations.\nAnother problem relates to long-standing geopolitical fissures. As recent cases demonstrate at both the bilateral and multilateral levels, China is in no hurry to work with the European Union or the United States within the international trading system. The global community is still dealing with Chinese overcapacity, as demonstrated by the reluctance of the Biden administration to remove several of the Trump era tariffs. China’s likely failure to fulfill its Phase One trade purchase obligations also underscores its patchy record of following through on international commitments. Within the WTO, China faces other persistent criticisms, including fundamental questions about whether its economy is market-driven. As Wall Street Journal trade reporter Jacob Schlesinger wrote, “China swallowed the WTO.” The prevalence of this sentiment further throws into question the ability of the WTO to play its role as an arbiter of trade disputes. Nevertheless, it remains in both the short-term and long-term interests of China and the United States to demonstrate to the international community that they are capable of earnest negotiations that would help solve a global commons problem. It would also demonstrate a mutual commitment to using a multilateral forum to resolve disputes. In other words, difficult as it may be, renegotiating the EGA would add diplomatic credibility to both countries, while demonstrating a clear desire to rehabilitate a gridlocked international organization.\nAnother major problem is that the United States does not appear to be in any hurry to conclude any trade agreements. The Biden Administration and USTR in particular are sensitive to political pressure coming from the more progressive members of the Democratic party as well as organized labor. While negotiating a trade commitment with climate change mitigation as a central goal would assuage some fears among the progressive left, experts interviewed for this paper emphasized that the Biden administration appears reluctant to move to jumpstart EGA negotiations.\nFinally, it may be that negotiating tariff reductions on environmental goods is simply not worth the effort it would require. APEC commitments were MFN-tariff reductions and voluntary. Therefore, countries outside of APEC benefitted when APEC members reduced tariff rates, but APEC countries were not required to act. This voluntary status ensured that the APEC agreement would not violate existing WTO rules. Most countries have reduced their tariffs accordingly. However, tariffs on the 54 items were generally already quite low among APEC countries. If every country implemented the agreement and set tariffs at no more than 5 percent, the overall simple average tariff would be 1.8 percent, a small difference from the average prior to implementation. Certainly, there are individual products that would benefit from full implementation. China still maintains a 10 percent tariff on certain waste incinerators, though they excuse this through an ex-out. However, the political importance of the APEC agreement is significant. The APEC agreement served as a springboard for EGA negotiations, which would be binding and cover far more products. It also serves as proof that major countries like the United States and China can negotiate and reach a successful outcome on environmental issues.\nA Roadmap for a Restart\nTo jumpstart talks, the United States can lead by adding a fresh perspective and new momentum that bridges the Biden administration’s agenda of protecting workers and climate alike. However, a fresh agreement means the United States and its global partners cannot simply pick up where negotiations left off. If the EGA negotiations are to hold any promise, the definitions and processes surrounding them merit a fundamental re-imagination. If nothing else, WTO member states have proven exceptionally creative at finding ways to do what they want, and so member states should apply that same creativity to environmental goods.\nFirst, the United States should lead by proposing a new framework for negotiations that avoids many of the pitfalls of previous approaches to defining environmental goods. This new framework would focus on the primary drivers of climate change and seek to liberalize goods that play a direct role in combating climate change. Today, the top contributors to global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are, from most to least emitting: 1) energy use in industry, 2) agriculture, forestry, and land use, 3) energy use in buildings, 4) energy use in transport, and 5) other categories, such as fugitive emissions. The international community should begin by negotiating an agreement to liberalize goods with specific capabilities to tackle these top five emissions categories. By no means exhaustive, the below table suggests HTS items for negotiators to consider under this framework. The table below suggests that negotiators begin with five goods for each of the five top contributing categories of global GHG emissions. In general, these categories would have direct impacts on climate change mitigation, such as filtering air pollution on an industrial scale or treating contaminated water. Many, but not all, of these goods were included on previous WTO and APEC lists, though new items have been added to account for changes in technology. Among these items previously negotiated, preference was given to those where there was a relatively broad consensus on the need to reduce tariffs, for example, items on which the European Union, Canada, Japan, and United States had previously agreed. This table provides a working list of goods likely to achieve international consensus while demonstrating that the core goal of the negotiation is climate-focused, which should move the needle on domestic politics.\nIt is important to note two limitations to this list. First, it is not exhaustive and would be subject to fine-tuning by individual governments and their trade negotiators. Since 6-digit HTS codes are standardized globally and can be further specified via ex-outs, this path seeks to avoid additional problems that may arise from having to coordinate additional specifications relating to HTS codes. However, by limiting the scope of goods covered to a simple number of 30, this proposal lowers the bar for success among negotiators since the total number of goods covered would be significantly less than the items covered under the APEC agreement at the same it refocuses attention on items that would have climate-mitigating impacts. Beginning with a more limited number of items, which exclude some of the more controversial items on previous lists, should help move the negotiations forward.\nSecond, the table relies on six-digit HTS codes, which offers some benefits and some drawbacks. Six-digit HTS codes are broad categories, meaning a deal to liberalize tariffs on a six-digit code would encompass a greater number of goods than a more specific HTS number, such as a 10- or 12-digit code. If the goal of an agreement is to liberalize tariffs on as many goods as possible—especially if operating under the already stricter parameters suggested in this paper—then pursuing a six-digit code for negotiations would be both simplest and cover the greatest number of goods. However, relying on six-digit codes leaves negotiators to deal with ex-outs. Ex-outs for HTS codes further specify which goods within each HS-6 category would be treated as environmental and therefore subject to the tariff reductions under the final agreement. For example, the table includes HTS code 4418.72 for joinery and carpentry wood. It would be the task of government officials and negotiators to further specify relevant ex-outs, which in this case could include bamboo products since bamboo is more environmentally friendly than wood harvested from old-growth forests. In other words, by including bamboo as an ex-out, negotiators would agree only to liberalize tariffs on bamboo wood products and not those wood products designated as more environmentally harmful. Since ex-outs are not always the most efficient way to identify environmental goods within broader HTS codes, the HTS system should be updated to better reflect new technologies so that, for example, EVs and gas vehicles have their own 6-digit HTS line to better facilitate tariff applications. Additionally, if talks are launched using six-digit codes as basic framework, negotiators should work toward further specification and aim to conclude a deal with greater specificity, for example using 10-digit HTS codes, which would obviate the need to negotiate ex-outs. In other words, this approach provides diplomatic latitude in the initial stages of negotiations but encourages negotiators to seek further specificity in ensuing rounds. While far from encyclopedic, this table seeks to recalibrate the approach to what is considered an environmental good.\nA New Framework\nThere are several benefits of this new framework. First, it would reinvigorate the EGA discussion by putting direct climate change mitigation at the forefront of multilateral trade policy objectives. The world is running out of time. The global carbon clock, which measures how long humans have before the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere causes ecological collapse, serves as a constant call to action: the international community must act swiftly within every existing multilateral framework to combat climate change. While the WTO is not a forum focused explicitly on climate policy, it can still play an integral role in helping countries speed up their respective climate agendas, and an agreement on environmental goods would represent a tangible step in the right direction. According to the WTO, “Freer trade is not an end in itself; it is tied to crucially important human values and welfare goals . . . Among these goals are raising standards of living, optimal use of the world’s resources in accordance with the objective of sustainable development, and protection and preservation of the environment.” Concluding a deal on environmental goods—specifically those with direct roles in reducing pollution and fighting climate change—would help member states maximize the existing WTO toolbox for international trade.\nSecond, this new framework offers countries a workaround to some of the topics that sank previous negotiations. For example, the deployment of bicycles, even on an industrial scale, is not going to capture carbon or industrial fugitive emissions. Producing and using more bicycles may help society reduce emissions over time, but it would be far too little to put the international community on the right path. Instead, negotiators should start with a list of items that is aimed at mitigating climate change on an industrial scale. This table also explicitly avoids other goods that are likely to slow or imperil negotiations from the start, such as lithium-ion batteries or solar panel components. Those individual goods are already the subject of fierce debate bilaterally and multilaterally, and it would be a mistake for negotiators to lump those goods in with a set of other goods that could have an immediate positive impact on combating climate change. Furthermore, like bicycles, the large-scale deployment of solar panels is laudable but unlikely to have a major mitigation effect in the immediate term unless it can be achieved on an industrial scale (akin to nearly 8 billion solar panels in the United States alone). Furthermore, the installation of new solar panels on an industrial scale would need to result in the closure or phasing out of fossil fuel production facilities such as coal plants.\nThird, there are increasing calls to measure goods traded through their carbon content or carbon footprint, akin to what is outlined in the European Union’s CBAM, which takes a sectoral approach to measuring carbon. However, there is currently no agreed-upon international framework or universal standard by which to measure carbon content. Bicycles, for example, consist largely of steel and aluminum, and therefore account for at least some greenhouse gas emissions during manufacturing and transport. Realizing the complexities of measuring carbon content and carbon footprints, the structure this paper proposes for negotiations obviates the need to measure carbon content by only including goods on the list that are deemed to have a direct effect on mitigating climate change.\nFourth, this framework does not necessarily represent massive tariff cuts to environmental goods, which also lowers the bar for negotiators. Most of the proposed HTS codes already have low average tariffs. HTS Code 8608.00 covering certain railway components had an average tariff in EGA negotiating countries in 2020 of 2.2 percent, but South Korea’s tariff is 8 percent. HTS Code 9013.90 covering certain oceanography monitoring equipment had an average tariff of 0.9 percent, but the United States maintained a tariff of 5.1 percent in 2020. HTS Code 8407.90 covers biogas heaters and had an average applied tariff of 2.2 percent, but China maintained a 14 percent tariff. Harmonizing these tariff rates and reducing already low tariffs to zero is a critical step in liberalizing the trade of environmental goods.\nIn terms of structuring negotiations, there is debate over whether a plurilateral or multilateral agreement would be the best approach. A plurilateral agreement would reduce the possibility of free-riding; it would be more easily reached and faster to conclude; and it would incentivize others to join over time. The costs of a plurilateral agreement are that a smaller number of countries would participate; others may be slow to join; and the overall impact on climate change mitigation would be smaller since there would be fewer participating member states at the outset. Therefore, a plurilateral approach would likely mean more limited progress on climate than a multilateral agreement.\nRealizing the complexities of measuring carbon content and carbon footprints, the structure this paper proposes for negotiations obviates the need to measure carbon content by only including goods on the list that are deemed to have a direct effect on mitigating climate change.\nThe central risk of a multilateral agreement, on the other hand, is increased free-riding since liberalization benefits would extend to all WTO members. However, a multilateral agreement would involve a larger number of member states, and China would need to participate in order to meet any likely minimum threshold. A multilateral agreement’s main benefit is that it would include more participants, which would mean a greater impact on the climate, even though the list of covered goods would be shorter than in the previous negotiation.\nIn addition to recalibrating the structure and definitions at the heart of EGA negotiations, the United States should pursue other means of moving the negotiations forward. First, it should pursue a multilateral agreement on environmental goods. If an agreement were not reached in two years, the United States would lead a shift to a plurilateral format among like-minded countries with an interest in the swift conclusion of a deal. This initial step favors a big tent approach that leads to more trade liberalization, which would have a greater impact on climate change mitigation. However, given the higher risk of failure that multilateral negotiations pose, as well as the possibility that negotiations would drag on interminably, the recommendation leaves open the alternative of switching to a plurilateral agreement if a predetermined deadline is not met.\nSecond, the United States should insist the tariff reductions apply to normal duties, but governments should be allowed to retain their right to impose anti-dumping and countervailing duties or take safeguard actions consistent with WTO rules. This was already the case with original EGA negotiations, but explicitly building in these protections would signal a commitment to liberalize trade in environmental goods, while explicitly upholding trade laws.\nThird, the United States should accept the 80 percent critical threshold and the Chinese snapback at 70 percent but provide no special exceptions for developing countries. A threshold of 80 percent would allow negotiating countries to pursue a deal without having to meet an arbitrarily high standard of goods traded, which may otherwise mean that certain countries, such as India, would need to participate. Agreeing to the snapback provision would serve as a concession to the Chinese, while simultaneously building in protections for U.S.-produced goods. However, since China still receives developing country status at the WTO, the United States should work to ensure that the agreement contains no special exceptions for developing countries in order to ensure China must meet the same commitments as developed nations.\nFourth, the United States should abandon the ITA structure for phasing-in tariff reductions and provide for all tariffs going to zero immediately upon entry into force of the agreement. Climate change is an existential threat, and an immediate reduction of tariffs would hasten the deployment of climate change mitigating technologies. Furthermore, such an arrangement would signal to the world that the WTO is an international forum capable of producing agreements that have an immediate impact.\nClimate policy and the multilateral trading system both need a creative revitalization to show that they are capable of addressing the twenty-first century’s most pressing problem. While jumpstarting EGA negotiations is not the most significant action nations could take, it nevertheless would add credibility to international actors as well as the trading system itself. A new EGA will increase efficiency and resiliency by helping countries exchange goods and technologies vital to efforts to combat climate change. Furthermore, China and the United States have clear political motivations to conclude an environmental goods deal. Both are significantly behind the European Union when it comes to climate progress, and reaching a deal, however limited in scope, would add momentum to global efforts to mitigate climate change. On the U.S. side, committing to an agreement on environmental goods would also demonstrate that the country is back and reengaging in earnest with the multilateral system—a core goal of the Biden administration.\nDespite the need for progress on a new agreement on environmental goods, many of the experts interviewed for this project discounted the idea that new EGA negotiations were feasible and that a deal could be concluded. In large part, this opinion was based on the assumption that concluding new trade agreements is a bottom-tier priority for the Biden administration and that it would remain very challenging for the United States and China to reach even a limited agreement in the near future. While experts expressed skepticism about whether a new EGA could be concluded, many of them, including key negotiators present during initial negotiations, were not prepared to surrender. Trade experts view an environmental goods agreement as a win-win-win for trade, the environment, and development, and many of them expressed a sincere desire that countries launch renegotiations immediately. Indeed, if the end goal is to demonstrate both the aptitude of the WTO for tackling the nexus of trade and climate issues—while simultaneously combating climate change itself—the international community should agree to restart negotiations.\nClimate policy and the multilateral trading system both need a creative revitalization to show that they are capable of addressing the twenty-first century’s most pressing problem.\nThe administration’s reluctance to pursue a new EGA directly conflicts with its agenda to improve global qualify of life, combat climate change, grow the domestic economy, and reengage with multilateral partners. Hopefully, the new framework proposed here will put direct climate change mitigation at the forefront of multilateral trade policy objectives and offer member states a viable path to circumvent some of the topics that sank previous negotiations. The proposed framework also avoids some of the drawbacks that result from other methods of defining environmental goods, including classifying goods according to their carbon intensity. Altogether, this new framework, which is more limited and targeted in scope, offers a viable starting point for member states to rethink their entrenched views on a potential agreement on environmental goods. Once this base level liberalization of goods is completed, countries should then work to reach a second agreement on non-tariff barriers and environmental services and to expand the tariff coverage of the first one. A small but consequential multilateral agreement—one that includes the European Union, China, and the United States—would demonstrate that the diplomatic toolbox isn’t rusty—it just needs a revitalized approach.\nWilliam A.

{"id": "8407", "text": "Panga Movie Review: Team Panga, take a thigh-five\n(U) 132 min\nCast: Kangana Ranaut, Jassi Gill, Richa Chadda, Neena Gupta, Yagya Bhasin\nDirector: Ashwiny Iyer Tiwari\nThe title of writer-director Ashwiny Iyer Tiwari’s third film, Panga, insinuates that some dramatic fireworks await us. And since the film stars Kangana Ranaut, it’s only natural that we approach it expecting some high jinks and spirited brawls.\nPanga has all that, but of the sweet, gentle variety. The kind that doesn’t seem sensational, but is, in fact, momentous — big, massive shifts in small, little lives.\nPanga is a charming, warm, gharelu dramatisation of the thing that seethes for years and then dies within the walls of many homes — unfulfilled dreams of mummyjis born out of what they were capable of, the life they could have had, what they had to give up for their family and grihasti.\nIn Panga, that dream, that yearning, is pivoted on real talent and achievements and is nurtured by more than just self-belief. It is cradled by a supporting family.\nOne half of Panga is devoted to reminiscing and yearning for the life left behind. The pain, heartache make this part throb with low-grade but continuous disappointment and despair that, in the everydayness of life, gets exhausted and retires exhausted on most nights.\nThe other half of the film is in pursuit of that dream, going from one city to another, one training session to a bout, followed by more bouts.\nHere it loses some of its magic as it turns into a competitive sports procedural.\nThough the sports bits are quite nicely done — much better that what many big directors have managed in bigger films — Panga’s strength lies in its well-defined characters played by excellent actors.\nThe first part is nicely populated by them, while the second part relies almost entirely on Kangana Ranaut. Though she is fabulous throughout, without the others the film loses some steam. But there’s an honest purpose to this slowing down, to showing the mundanity of the pursuit of a dream, of the high that hardly ever comes.\nPanga doesn’t try to portray making mid-life choices easy or inevitable. There are no mean spouses to run away from, no revenge that awaits extraction.\nIt shows the difficulty of making that choice, on the mummyji and the family. It also shows that just because you decided to venture out, no one will be waiting with garlands for you.\nBut, it says, with all the attendant problems, heartaches and absolutely no guarantee of success, if you do find yourself often thinking of a life that could have been, and there is even a sliver of chance that you can, maybe, attempt to grab a tiny piece of it, go for it.\nSet in Bhopal, Panga tells the story of Jaya Nigam (Kangana Ranaut), a railway employee who hands out train tickets at a railway station.\nShe is the mother of a seven-year-old Adi (Yagya Bhasin), and the wife of sweet Prashant (Jessie Gill). She loves them both and her life is in a loop of a daily routine that leaves little time to chew the cud of life that once was.\nBut every once in a while, after she has put little post-its in their tiffin boxes, after she has cut work to take her son to the doctor, and after the relaxing evening walk with her husband, something plays in her dreams that makes her throw sudden kicks while asleep.\nThe film’s story takes a turn when Jaya misses Adi’s sports day because of work and though she tries to make up to him, he is insulting and rude.\nPrashant, the caring husband who often plays mediator between Jaya and the world, tells Adi the story of his and Jaya’s romance, and about his mother who was, seven years and two months ago, the captain of India’s Kabaddi team.\nEnter, Serena Williams.\nAdi stalks Williams’ post childbirth life online and at home he stalks Prashant with the suggestion that a comeback at 32 years of age is not unthinkable.\nWhen Prashant ignores him, Adi piles on guilt.\nPanga doesn’t show a dramatic, let’s conquer-the-world return of Jaya to the arena where the skies thunder and gods throw rose petals.\nIt shows a mother who, with determination and a punishing routine, struggles, wavers, but goes on. It shows her emotional struggle at having to leave behind her life and family, of having to make tough choices, sacrifices — and the impact it has on others.\nWe see the hurdles she faces, the snide remarks she endures, the big age gap between her and other players, the insinuation that she has come riding on past accolades, and a captain who is not at all keen on celebrity comebacks.\nIn this segment, where the wait is long and victories elusive, the film tries to inject some drama by summoning Jaya’s former teammate and bestie, Meenu (Richa Chaddha).\nBut as the teams of South Korea and Iran loom, and Jaya sits in the sidelines, tapping her feet and waiting, the film leads up to a climax that’s predictable and yet it made me chew up one corner of my shawl.\nWritten by Nitesh Tiwari and directed by Ashwiny Iyer Tiwari, the husband and wife team that gave us the fabulous Bareilly Ki Barfi (2017), Panga mostly spurns melodrama, and instead gives us a world we can connect with and live in for a bit.\nPanga’s heart lies in Jaya and Prashant’s middle class life built around domesticity, where everyone tries to catch those five extra minutes of sleep in the morning, then rushes about getting ready, calling out for stuff, screaming instructions before rushing out, leaving clothes, used utensils strewn around in a quiet house, and then returning, one by one, in the evening, bringing the house back to life with chatter, hot meals and laughter.\nThis world is knitted together beautifully by the screenplay writers, the art director and the costume designer.\nThe hand-knitted sweaters, a dinning table where bottles of achar and sauce sit always and the switch boards with the darkened area around them carrying telltale signs of life needing both, light and air.\nThis world is inhabited by characters who are distinct and filled with lovely details. And all these characters are assigned to actors who inhabit them with honesty, sensitivity and skill.\nJessie Gill as Prashant, with his big, reassuring smile, is just the perfect foil to the Ranaut’s simmering Jaya whose emotions dance in her eyes all the time.\nNeena Gupta has a small role, but adds character to Jaya and Prashant’s life.\nRicha Chadda, who obviously piled on some weight for the role of the kabaddi coach without making a big deal of it, is very good, though her character is the only one that’s a bit filmy and often utilitarian —mostly her job is to shine the spotlight on Jaya.\nPanga taught me a lot about kabaddi — what is a raid, how a dead player can come alive. But what I really enjoyed watching was the girls’ victory gesture — simultaneously slapping their thigh and raising a hand in a gesture of, teri toh… It’s called the thigh-five.\nPanga’s team can take a moment to take a thigh-five.", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

{"id": "8429", "text": "You have probably heard of dogs getting mange. However, what you might not realize is that sarcoptic mange in dogs is transmissible to humans. Yes, sarcoptic mange is a zoonotic disease that you can catch from your pooch!\nWhat Causes Sarcoptic Mange in Dogs?\nSarcoptic mange is caused by mites that burrow into the skin of your dog and feed on the skin’s cells. The condition is often referred to as ‘scabies’. The mites will make your dog itch. He will probably chew, and scratch is skin constantly to find relief. Usually, you’ll notice a large amount of hair disappearing on his legs and belly. In infected areas, the skin can also thicken and darken in color.\nCatching Mange from Your Dog\nYes, you can catch sarcoptic mange from your dog. In fact, it is highly contagious. Once in a human, the mites cannot complete their lifecycle, but they will make you miserable until they die by causing severe skin itching.\nHow Do Dogs Catch Mange?\nSometimes pet dogs catch mange from wild foxes. If you live on land or your yard is frequented by foxes, then your pooch can catch the mites. You’ll need to keep your dog away from the infected areas and wildlife to avoid infection or re-infection.\nDiagnosis of Sarcoptic Mange\nSarcoptic mange is diagnosed by simple skin scrapings. Typically, your vet will know the dog has mange upon inspection, but skin scrapings help confirm the diagnosis.\nSeveral medications are effective against mange. You can choose between baths and dips. There also injections and oral medications. In many instances, your vet will combine treatments to rapidly resolve the infection before you catch it from your pooch.\n- Dips: A dip consists of a solution of amitraz or lime-sulfur.\n- Topicals: You apply the topical directly to the afflicted area where the mites are living in the pet’s skin. Topical medications include imidacloprid, moxidectin, fipronil, or selamectin.\nOral medications: Your veterinarian can prescribe either a pill, flavored chew, or liquid medication to orally treat sarcoptic mange. The medications might include afoxolaner, milbemycin, sarolaner, or fluralaner.\nDogs with sarcoptic mange are miserable. The intense itching can make tears in the skin and lead to secondary bacterial infections which will require treatment with antibiotics.\nTreating the Environment\nUsually, you’ll have to give your dog multiple treatments to get a handle on the mange and prevent re-infection. In addition, you’ll have to tackle cleaning your living space by washing your pet’s bedding using a bleach solution.\nIf you suspect that your dog has given you sarcoptic mange, then you’ll want to schedule a visit with your family doctor. You’ll need to tell your physician that you have been exposed to sarcoptic mange (often referred to as scabies in humans). The mites will die within a few days of infecting a human’s skin but during that time you will suffer from intense itching so, ideally, you should seek prompt treatment to gain relief from the uncomfortable skin condition.", "scores": {"score": 3, "score_transform_1": 5, "score_transform_2": 5, "score_transform_3": 0}}

{"id": "8488", "text": "China is the most populous country in the world, with a population of over 1.4 billion people. The country has a unique culture and customs surrounding death and dying, and end-of-life care in China is different from other countries. In this article, we will explore hospice care in China, local customs and practices when someone dies, and what you should do when someone dies in China.\nHospice Care in China\nHospice care in China is still in its early stages of development, and the concept of hospice care is not widely understood or accepted. However, the Chinese government has recognized the importance of palliative care and has made efforts to improve end-of-life care in the country. In 2016, the Chinese government released a five-year plan to improve palliative care services, which includes the development of hospice care facilities and training programs for healthcare professionals.\nDespite the government’s efforts, hospice care in China is still not widely available, and there is a shortage of trained healthcare professionals in the field of palliative care. The majority of end-of-life care in China is provided by family members, and many people die at home without professional medical assistance.\nLocal Customs and Practices when Someone Dies in China\nIn Chinese culture, death is considered a natural part of life, and there are many customs and practices surrounding death and dying. These customs and practices vary depending on the region and the individual’s religious beliefs.\nIn China, the mourning period for the deceased lasts for 49 days, which is divided into three stages. During the first seven days, the family will not leave the house, and friends and family members will come to pay their respects. The second stage lasts from the eighth day to the 40th day, during which time the family will continue to mourn and perform rituals to honor the deceased. The final nine days are a period of closure and transition, after which the family is expected to resume their normal lives.\nTraditionally, burial is the preferred method of disposing of the deceased in China. Cremation is becoming more popular due to land shortages and environmental concerns. In some regions, the deceased is buried with their personal belongings and even their favorite foods and drinks to sustain them in the afterlife.\nChinese funeral rites vary depending on the individual’s religious beliefs and the region. However, there are some common practices, such as burning incense, offering food and drink, and presenting white paper money (Joss paper) to the deceased to ensure a smooth transition to the afterlife.\nWhat Should You Do When Someone Dies in China?\nIf you are in China and someone dies, there are certain procedures that you must follow. Here are the steps you should take:\nContact the police or the local hospital immediately: In China, it is mandatory to report any death to the police or the local hospital within 24 hours.\nObtain a death certificate: You will need to obtain a death certificate from the local police station or the hospital. This certificate is required for legal and administrative purposes.\nNotify the deceased’s family: It is customary to notify the deceased’s family members as soon as possible. In China, it is the family’s responsibility to make funeral arrangements and perform mourning rites.\nMake funeral arrangements: The family is responsible for making funeral arrangements, including choosing the burial or cremation site, preparing the body, and arranging for a funeral service.\nRegister the death: The family must register the death at the local civil affairs bureau within 15 days. This is necessary for legal and administrative purposes.\nSettle the deceased’s affairs: The family must settle the deceased’s financial affairs, such as paying outstanding debts and canceling subscriptions or services. They should also notify any relevant government agencies, such as the deceased’s employer or the tax authorities.\nObserve mourning customs: The family should observe mourning customs according to their traditions and beliefs. This includes the mourning period and funeral rites discussed earlier.\nConsider organ donation: Organ donation is not common in China due to cultural and religious beliefs, but it is possible in some cases. The family should discuss this option with medical professionals if they are interested in donating the deceased’s organs.\nSeek professional help: The family may need professional help to cope with the loss of their loved one. There are counseling services available in China, and the family can also seek support from their community or religious organizations.\nIn conclusion, end-of-life care in China is still developing, and there is a need for more hospice care facilities and trained healthcare professionals in the field of palliative care. Chinese culture has unique customs and practices surrounding death and dying, and it is important to respect and observe these customs when someone dies. If you are in China and someone dies, it is important to follow the procedures outlined above to ensure that the deceased’s affairs are settled and that the family can properly mourn and honor their loved one.", "scores": {"score": 3, "score_transform_1": 5, "score_transform_2": 5, "score_transform_3": 0}}

This series appears on an occasional basis. It is prepared under the auspices of the Center for Pacific Basin Studies within the FRBSF’s Economic Research Department.\nEach year, the President of the San Francisco Fed joins the Federal Reserve Board Governor responsible for liaison with Asia on a “fact-finding” trip to the region. These trips advance the Bank’s broad objectives of serving as a repository of expertise on economic, banking, and financial issues relating to the Pacific Basin and of building ties with policymakers and economic officials there. The knowledge gained and the contacts developed are critical in understanding trends affecting the Twelfth District, in carrying out responsibilities in banking supervision, and in ensuring that policymakers have the understanding of global economic developments necessary to conduct policy and promote the stability of financial markets. This Economic Letter summarizes President Yellen’s report to the Head Office Board of Directors on her trip to China in November 2006.\nOur agenda took us to the two largest cities in China—Beijing, with about 15 million people, and Shanghai, with over 20 million—as well as to Chengdu, a “small” city (only 10 to 12 million people!) that is in Western China and that is the focus of intensive government development efforts. We met with senior government staff, including our counterparts at the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) and the China Bank Regulatory Commission, bankers, representatives of U.S. and Chinese businesses, academics, representatives of the U.S. Embassy, and experts from a number of multilateral institutions. Our focus was the economy, with particular emphasis on banking and finance, developments in the information technology (IT) sector, and energy and the environment. (For a discussion of findings from the trip regarding the banking and financial sectors, please see the March 2007 issue of the Bank’s publication, Asia Focus.)\nIn the nearly 30 years since China’s economic reform process began, the economy averaged an annual growth rate of about 10%, a performance that is probably unrivaled in human history and that has lifted hundreds of millions of people out of poverty. This growth has been facilitated by China’s abundant labor supply, which has been massively reallocated out of agriculture, where productivity is very low, and into the manufacturing and service sectors, where it is much higher. In addition, the pace of investment has been extraordinarily high, which has kept capacity growing. The efficiency with which the Chinese economy transforms inputs into output—what economists refer to as “total factor productivity”—has also improved.\nAlthough rapid growth has propelled living standards higher, the Chinese government has tried to slow growth somewhat during the past few years, using for the most part the traditional tools of monetary policy, such as raising lending rates and increasing reserve requirements. Though these measures were expected to produce a mild slowdown in early 2006, the economy instead grew almost 11% in the first half of the year, the fastest pace since 1995.\nSome analysts believe that the traditional tools are not terribly efficacious in the Chinese context, and, indeed, in the last six months, the government also has employed administrative measures to curb loan growth, local government investment, and property speculation, such as mandating that local authorities postpone or cancel investment projects failing to meet land use limits and other approval rules. These efforts, together with the more traditional monetary policy actions, did finally produce some slowing of real GDP growth in the latter half of 2006.\nGiven that consumer price inflation has remained low in the past year—1.9% year-over-year in November—it is natural to ask why Chinese policymakers perceive a need to slow growth (update March 2007: the average inflation rate from January to October 2006 was only 1.3%; in December, it ticked up to 2.8% and then fell to 2.0% in January 2007). A primary rationale relates to concerns about the quantity and quality of investment. According to commonly cited figures, fixed investment in recent years has amounted to over 40% of GDP, and it actually accelerated during 2006. Policymakers are worried that this level of investment is too high, fearing that the overinvestment in the cement, steel, and aluminum sectors, as well as in real estate, could lead to excess capacity and a destabilizing boom-bust cycle. Policymakers are also worried that investment spending is not being efficiently allocated across sectors, reflecting concerns that banks still do not operate on a fully efficient and commercial basis; poor lending decisions could saddle banks with new rounds of bad loans just when real progress has finally been made in cleaning up the banking system.\nEconomists with whom we met at some multilateral institutions have observed that a substantial share of investment is financed not by banks but by firms from their own internal funds; in other words, enterprise saving is very high. This suggests that the high pace of investment poses fewer risks to the banking sector than it might otherwise. The Chinese government, with endorsement from the International Monetary Fund, has suggested that state-owned enterprises should distribute a larger share of their profits to the government via dividends, thus raising government revenue, which, in turn, could be used to fund social expenditures, particularly to strengthen the social safety net.\nChina has long enjoyed an overall current account surplus, and recently it has grown enormously—from 2.4% of GDP in 2002 to 7.2% in 2005, with even higher prospects for 2006. This, combined with a sizable capital account surplus, has put upward pressure on the value of China’s currency, the renminbi (RMB). Beginning in July 2005, the Chinese government officially unpegged the RMB from the dollar, and, since then, the currency has appreciated by about 6%. Chinese policymakers seem likely to allow this process of gradual RMB appreciation to continue, so long as it is slow and orderly. Few people, however, believe that even a more substantial RMB appreciation would have much effect on China’s overall trade balance. For one thing, to the extent that China imports many components used in producing its export goods, an appreciation lowers the cost of those imports, offsetting somewhat the effect on export prices. For another, demand for many Chinese exports tends to be fairly strong, regardless of price, which implies a limited trade response to an appreciation. Most observers do not see China’s trade surplus coming down until it ramps up government spending and domestic consumption, increasing its own demand for foreign imports.\nTo exert some control on slow and orderly movements in the RMB, the PBOC intervenes in the foreign exchange market, buying dollars with RMB that it issues. This intervention has resulted in the PBOC’s accumulation of over $1 trillion in foreign reserve assets. Moreover, such intervention also swells the domestic supply of bank reserves. Therefore, to avoid inflation, the PBOC must offset the associated liquidity increase by sterilizing reserve inflows. It has accomplished this by issuing low-yield PBOC bills in open market operations and by progressively raising the reserve requirements of domestic banks. However, the policy of forcing low-yield PBOC bills on the banking sector works at cross-purposes with banking sector reforms, which are ultimately aimed at creating a banking sector that operates on a sound commercial basis.\nA fundamental law of macroeconomics, which is well appreciated by our colleagues at the PBOC, holds that an independent monetary policy, free capital flows, and a fixed exchange rate cannot all mutually coexist. Thus, greater exchange rate flexibility will eventually be required for China to manage the economy via an independent monetary policy. In the short run, however, the authorities are concerned that the country’s banks and firms are not yet fully prepared to cope with a free-floating currency. We discussed with the PBOC in Shanghai the progress that is being made in introducing hedging instruments, such as foreign exchange forward and swap contracts and the experience of banks and other domestic financial institutions in managing exchange rate variability. Of course, Chinese policymakers are also concerned that a large currency appreciation could have a deleterious effect on exports, particularly in sectors with low profit margins, such as textiles.\nWe spent some time learning more about issues relating to energy and the environment, which are of increasing concern to policymakers. China’s current pattern of growth is highly energy-intensive, and energy use has been expanding proportionately faster than output. Oil accounts for only about 20% of energy use, but almost half is supplied from imports; thus, China’s rapid growth in oil demand has worked to push up global prices. The main source of energy (almost 70%) is domestic coal, and a very worrisome consequence of coal use is that it produces air pollution, which, in many Chinese cities, is among the worst in the world. Water shortages have also become more serious as a result of rapid urbanization, underpriced water costs, and water pollution. There is now much discussion of the need for sustainable development, and government officials discussed efforts to boost energy conservation and reduce environmental damage, including tightening controls on power plant emissions and implementing more market-based pricing of fuel and water use. One overall goal is to reduce the ratio of fuel to GDP by 20% over the next five years.\nWe met with U.S. businesspeople involved in a wide range of sectors, including banking and finance, IT, research and development, and retail and service-oriented firms. Overall, they continue to see huge opportunities associated with China’s market size and low-cost labor.\nChina’s coastal regions have traditionally attracted the lion’s share of foreign direct investment. But a high priority of the Chinese government is to promote the development of inland areas, particularly Western China, out of concern with growing income inequality, poverty, and associated social and political unrest in these areas. This was our main focus in Chengdu. We saw some evidence of the city’s success in the form of a large international retail chain store and a brand new assembly plant for a U.S. maker of computer chips. Logistics are a key problem for firms operating in this region. For export-oriented manufacturing firms, rail or river transport costs to the coast offset much of the advantage of the lower labor costs in this area. But firms that are able to use air transport find it profitable to operate, and the government is highly cooperative in minimizing obstacles.\nChinese policymakers are eager to see China move up the value chain and promote indigenous innovation. They are pushing foreign firms to contribute by shifting higher value-added activity to China. The executives at some high-tech firms with whom we met shared the view that Chinese-educated engineers and other professionals are technically very competent. But they regard their training as narrow and perceive a shortage of broader problem-solving and management skills. To address this issue, Chinese policymakers are now trying to encourage creativity in the educational system as well as entrepreneurship and risk-taking in the workplace. Some of those we talked to also regard protection of intellectual property rights as an ongoing concern.\nAs I have indicated, China’s recent development path has been characterized not only by high investment and rapid growth, but also by concerns about income disparities, investment efficiency, and environmental problems. According to the 11th Five-Year Plan (for 2006-2010), China’s top political leadership agreed to pursue structural policies that would emphasize more consumption over investment and exports as well as the growth of the service sector instead of industry, improve the efficiency of investment, and reduce income inequality and establish a more “harmonious society” through more social spending.\nThese are ambitious goals, and a number of policies are under discussion to achieve them. These include better pricing of energy, resources, land, and environmental damage, reducing implicit and explicit subsidies for manufactures and exports, establishing a dividend policy for state-owned enterprises to reduce corporate funds available for investment, and dampening local government incentives to pursue higher growth single-mindedly.\nIf such policies are put in place, a number of benefits may accrue. For example, raising domestic consumption demand would help to lower China’s external surplus imbalance, thereby reducing current trade frictions and the risks of protectionism. In addition, focusing on the “quality” rather than the quantity of investment could generate productivity gains. Finally, greater government spending, particularly on pensions and health care, would reduce government saving and precautionary household saving.\nJanet L.

{"id": "8540", "text": "While certain factors might make some individuals more resilient than others, resilience isn’t necessarily a personality trait that only some people possess. On the contrary, resilience involves behaviours, thoughts, and actions that anyone can learn and develop. The ability to learn this is one reason research has shown that resilience is ordinary, not extraordinary.\nLife may not come with a map, but everyone will experience twists and turns from everyday challenges to traumatic events with more lasting impact, like the death of a loved one, a life-altering accident, or a serious illness. Each change affects people differently, bringing a unique flood of thoughts, strong emotions, and uncertainty. Yet people generally adapt well over time to life-changing situations and stressful situations—in part thanks to resilience.\nPsychologists define resilience as the process of adapting well in the face of adversity, trauma, tragedy, threats, or significant sources of stress—such as family or relationship problems, serious health problems, or workplace and financial stressors. As much as resilience involves “bouncing back” from these difficult experiences, it can also involve profound personal growth.\nWhile these adverse events, much like rough river waters, are certainly painful and difficult, they don’t have to determine the outcome of your life. There are many aspects of your life you can control, modify, and grow with. That’s the role of resilience. Becoming more resilient not only helps you get through difficult circumstances, it also empowers you to grow and improve your life along the way.\nResiliency is not...\nBeing resilient doesn’t mean that a person won’t experience difficulty or distress. People who have suffered major adversity or trauma in their lives commonly experience emotional pain and stress. In fact, the road to resilience is likely to involve considerable emotional distress.\nLike building a muscle, increasing your resilience takes time and intentionality. Focusing on four core components — connection, wellness, healthy thinking, and meaning — can empower you to withstand and learn from difficult and traumatic experiences.\nResiliency in real life...\nI recently witnessed resilience in our dog Gracie.\nWe have invited Gracie into our home recently. She is a retired puppy mama – 4 years old and cute as a button. Part of our agreement to the breeder was to have her spayed. No problem, we have a great vet and I actually thought that going through this experience with her would help us bond. We had also recognized that she needed some dental work done – so the vet was asked to do that procedure at the same time.\nBy the end of her surgery day she had lost her “lady parts” as well as 16 teeth. Her dental work was more extreme than we had anticipated and 6 of her teeth were considered major extractions.\nWhen I picked her up I realized 2 things:\nI am wholly and completely in love with this little 4 pound munchkin.\nThere was a long recovery road ahead of her.\nArmed with meds, cautions, and Gracie we headed home. Let’s just say both ends of her little body were in bad shape. She napped most of the evening and was “allowed” 2 tablespoons of food that evening if she was up to it. When she woke up she took her food – thank you very much – and I’d like more please. I was told that if she didn’t eat in the morning after surgery she was to go back to the vets to get fluids. Eating was NO problem for our girl. Blessed with great friends, I had numerous offers to watch Gracie while I walked Diesel (her big bro).\nHere’s what I learned. She recognized she was surrounded by love (connection), she stepped into her recovery like the trooper she is and was far more active then the vet tech suggested she would be in a short period of time (wellness), I know that there were times when she could have just laid in her bed – but she forced herself to get up to eat, sniff and snuggle (healthy thinking), and she was heavily motivated by being able to be independent again (meaning). I also know that she has not read or been trained in resiliency. It’s innate to her – I wonder is it innate to humans as well? Is it something that we may lose sight of on occasion, but by reminding ourselves of the four core components can we step back into the best version of our resilient selves?", "scores": {"score": 4, "score_transform_1": 5, "score_transform_2": 5, "score_transform_3": 0}}

{"id": "8598", "text": "Modding has become a popular pastime for gamers who want to customize their gaming experience. But when it comes to horror games, the question of whether modding is legal or not becomes a gray area. While some mods are harmless and simply change the appearance of the game, others can alter the game’s mechanics and storyline, which raises concerns about copyright infringement and intellectual property rights. In this article, we will explore the legal implications of modding horror games and ask the question: is it illegal to mod a game?\nWhat are game mods?\nModding: A brief history\nGame mods, short for modifications, are alterations made to the original game files to customize the gameplay experience. They can range from small tweaks, such as changing the color of a character’s outfit, to complete overhauls that transform the game’s mechanics and storyline. The practice of modding has been around since the early days of gaming, with players experimenting with game code to create their own unique experiences.\nOne of the earliest examples of modding was in the late 1980s and early 1990s, when players of the game Wolfenstein 3D created new levels and textures to expand upon the game’s content. This was followed by the rise of fan-made modifications for games such as Doom and Quake, which introduced new gameplay mechanics and storylines.\nAs gaming technology advanced, so did the capabilities of modding. With the release of games such as The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind and GTA III, players were able to create more complex modifications that altered the game’s code and mechanics. This led to the creation of dedicated modding communities, such as the Nexus Mods and Skyrim Nexus, which provided a platform for modders to share their creations with others.\nToday, modding has become an integral part of the gaming experience, with many games actively encouraging modding and providing tools for players to create their own content. The popularity of modding has also led to the emergence of a modding industry, with companies such as CD Projekt Red and Valve actively supporting and promoting modding for their games.\nDespite the widespread acceptance of modding, there are still questions surrounding the legality of modding. Some game developers and publishers view modding as a violation of their intellectual property rights, while others actively encourage and support it. As such, the legal gray area surrounding game mods remains a topic of debate and discussion within the gaming community.\nThe popularity of game mods\nIn recent years, game mods have become increasingly popular among gamers and developers alike. Game mods are modifications made to an existing game that alter its content, mechanics, or graphics. These modifications can range from simple tweaks to the game’s visuals or sound effects to more complex changes such as adding new levels or characters.\nOne of the reasons for the popularity of game mods is the ability for players to customize their gaming experience. With mods, players can change the game to suit their personal preferences, making it more challenging or easier depending on their skill level. Additionally, mods can add new life to old games, giving players a reason to return to a game they may have otherwise stopped playing.\nAnother reason for the rise in popularity of game mods is the availability of tools and resources that make it easier for players to create and share their own mods. Many games now come with built-in modding tools, and there are also numerous third-party modding tools and communities available online. This has led to a thriving modding scene, with thousands of mods available for popular games such as Skyrim, Fallout, and Minecraft.\nThe popularity of game mods has also caught the attention of developers, who have started to embrace modding as a way to enhance their games. Some developers have even released official modding tools and have encouraged players to create their own mods. This has led to a new form of collaboration between developers and players, with mods becoming an integral part of the gaming experience.\nDespite the benefits of game mods, there are also concerns about the legal implications of modding. While some mods may be considered fair use, others could be seen as copyright infringement. This has led to debates about the legality of modding and the need for clearer guidelines and legal frameworks to protect both modders and developers.\nTypes of game mods\nCosmetic mods are modifications that alter the visual appearance of a game, without affecting its gameplay mechanics. These mods allow players to customize their gaming experience by changing the visual elements of the game, such as character models, skins, textures, and lighting effects.\nExamples of cosmetic mods include changing the appearance of weapons, adding new costumes for characters, or altering the visual effects of in-game abilities. These mods are designed to enhance the player’s experience by providing a more immersive and personalized gaming environment.\nWhile cosmetic mods do not affect the gameplay mechanics, they can still have a significant impact on the overall feel and aesthetics of the game. Many gamers use cosmetic mods to create a unique and personalized gaming experience, and they are often shared and distributed online through various platforms.\nThe legality of cosmetic mods is a complex issue, as they do not affect the core functionality of the game. While some developers actively encourage and support the use of cosmetic mods, others may view them as a violation of their intellectual property rights. The use of cosmetic mods is generally considered to be legal, as they do not provide any competitive advantage to players. However, it is important to note that the use of certain mods may violate the terms of service of the game or the platform on which they are hosted.\nGameplay mods are a type of mod that alter the way a game is played. These mods can range from simple tweaks to the game’s mechanics, such as changing the speed or difficulty, to more complex changes that fundamentally alter the game’s story or gameplay. For example, a gameplay mod might allow players to play as a different character, or it might introduce new enemies or items to the game.\nOne of the most popular types of gameplay mods is the “total conversion” mod, which replaces the game’s assets, mechanics, and story with entirely new content. Total conversion mods can be incredibly ambitious projects that require a significant amount of time and effort to create. However, they can also be highly rewarding for players who want to experience a game in a completely new way.\nAnother type of gameplay mod is the “balancing” mod, which aims to make the game more fair or challenging. For example, a balancing mod might make it easier for players to survive, or it might make the game’s enemies more difficult to defeat. Balancing mods can be particularly useful for players who feel that the game is too easy or too difficult, and who want to customize the game’s difficulty to their own preferences.\nOverall, gameplay mods offer players a great deal of flexibility and creativity when it comes to customizing their gaming experience. Whether you want to tweak the game’s mechanics, change the story, or introduce new content, gameplay mods provide a powerful tool for modifying and improving your favorite games.\nHorror game mods\nHorror game mods refer to modifications made to a horror game that alter its original content, such as adding new levels, characters, or storylines. These mods are created by players or enthusiasts who want to enhance their gaming experience or challenge themselves with a new level of difficulty. Horror game mods can be created for a variety of platforms, including PC, console, and mobile devices.\nSome popular horror game mods include:\n- New levels and areas: Mods that add new levels or areas to a horror game, often with new enemies, puzzles, and challenges.\n- New characters and storylines: Mods that introduce new characters or storylines to a horror game, which can provide a fresh perspective on the game’s narrative.\n- Gameplay changes: Mods that alter the gameplay mechanics of a horror game, such as increasing the difficulty level or changing the controls.\n- Cosmetic changes: Mods that change the visual appearance of a horror game, such as altering the graphics or adding new skins for characters or enemies.\nWhile horror game mods can enhance the gaming experience for players, they also raise legal questions about copyright infringement and intellectual property rights. The legality of modding a horror game depends on various factors, including the type of modification made and the intent of the modder.\nThe legal aspect of game mods\nCopyright law and game mods\nThe relationship between copyright law and game mods is a complex one, as it involves a delicate balance between protecting the rights of creators and allowing users the freedom to modify and personalize their gaming experiences. In general, copyright law grants creators exclusive rights over their work, including the right to reproduce, distribute, and display the work publicly. However, there are some exceptions and limitations to these rights that may apply to game mods.\nOne important factor to consider is the concept of fair use, which is a legal doctrine that allows for limited use of copyrighted material without obtaining permission from the original creator. Fair use is often invoked in situations where the use of copyrighted material is necessary for commentary, criticism, education, or other transformative purposes. In the context of game mods, some modders may argue that their modifications fall under the category of fair use, as they are using copyrighted material to create new and original content that adds value to the original game.\nHowever, whether or not a particular mod constitutes fair use is a subjective determination that depends on various factors, such as the nature of the modification, the purpose of the modder, and the potential impact on the original creator’s rights. In some cases, game developers and publishers may argue that mods infringe on their copyrights, particularly if the mods involve the unauthorized distribution of copyrighted material or if they compete with the original game’s market.\nAnother factor to consider is the use of licensed or proprietary software in the creation of game mods. Some modders may use third-party software or tools that are subject to licensing agreements or other legal restrictions. Failure to comply with these agreements or restrictions could result in legal consequences, such as copyright infringement or breach of contract claims.\nIn summary, the legal landscape surrounding game mods is complex and multifaceted, with a variety of legal doctrines and restrictions that may apply depending on the specific circumstances. While some mods may be protected by fair use or other legal exceptions, others may be subject to copyright infringement or other legal claims. As such, modders should be aware of the potential legal risks associated with their mods and take appropriate steps to protect themselves and their creations.\nTrademark law and game mods\nWhen it comes to the legal implications of modding horror games, trademark law is a crucial area to consider. Trademark law protects words, names, symbols, and other distinctive marks used to identify and distinguish a product or service from those of others. In the context of video games, trademark law can impact the modification of games in various ways.\n- Infringement of trademark rights: Modding a horror game might lead to infringement of the trademark rights of the original game’s developer or publisher. This could occur if the mod contains elements that are likely to cause confusion among consumers as to the source, sponsorship, or affiliation of the mod with the original game.\n- Dilution of trademark: Modding a horror game may also result in the dilution of the trademark rights of the original game’s developer or publisher. This could happen if the mod is marketed in a way that suggests an association with the original game, but without the authorization of the trademark owner.\n- Fan creations as fair use: In some cases, modding a horror game might be considered fair use under copyright law. This is particularly relevant when the mod is created for personal, non-commercial use and does not infringe on the original game’s copyright or trademark rights. However, the determination of whether a particular mod constitutes fair use is fact-specific and depends on various factors, such as the nature of the work, the purpose and character of the use, and the effect of the use on the potential market for the original work.\nOverall, the application of trademark law to horror game mods is a complex and evolving area of law. It is essential for modders to be aware of the legal risks associated with their mods and to take appropriate steps to minimize the risk of infringing on the trademark rights of the original game’s developer or publisher.\nPatent law and game mods\nWhen it comes to the legal implications of game mods, one area that often raises questions is patent law. In the United States, for example, patents are granted to inventors and creators to protect their intellectual property. This means that game developers hold the patent rights to their games, including any modifications made to them.\nHowever, the question remains as to whether modifying a game falls under the scope of patent infringement. While some argue that modding a game is a form of fair use, others contend that it violates the developer’s patent rights.\nIt’s worth noting that the U.S. legal system has yet to provide a clear answer on this matter. There have been cases where developers have taken legal action against modders, but these cases have been few and far between.\nThat being said, it’s important for modders to be aware of the potential legal risks associated with modifying a game. While it may be tempting to make changes to a game without concern for the legal implications, it’s crucial to understand the potential consequences of such actions.\nUltimately, the legality of game mods remains a gray area, and it’s up to modders to weigh the risks and make informed decisions about their actions.\nIs it illegal to mod a horror game?\nOne of the most debated questions in the gaming community is whether modding a horror game is legal or not. There have been several cases where developers have taken legal action against modders for using their intellectual property without permission. However, there are also instances where modders have been allowed to use the game’s code and assets to create new content.\nHere are some notable case studies that highlight the legal gray area of horror game mods:\nThe Doom Modding Community\nThe Doom modding community is one of the oldest and most active modding communities in the gaming industry. Over the years, thousands of mods have been created for the game, ranging from minor tweaks to complete overhauls of the game’s mechanics and graphics.\nIn 2016, ZeniMax, the developer of Doom, filed a lawsuit against the creator of a popular mod called “Doom 64 EX” for using copyrighted material without permission. The modder had used assets from the unreleased N64 version of Doom to create the mod. While the case was eventually settled out of court, it highlighted the potential legal risks associated with modding horror games.\nThe Silent Hill Modding Community\nThe Silent Hill modding community has also faced legal challenges in the past. In 2018, Konami, the developer of Silent Hill, issued a cease-and-desist order to a modder who had created a fan-made version of Silent Hill 2. The modder had used the game’s code and assets to create a new storyline that was not approved by the developer.\nHowever, the modding community rallied around the modder and created a petition to allow the mod to be released. The petition received over 150,000 signatures, and eventually, Konami withdrew the cease-and-desist order, allowing the mod to be released.\nThe Skyrim Modding Community\nThe Skyrim modding community is one of the largest and most successful modding communities in the gaming industry. Modders have created thousands of mods for the game, ranging from new weapons and armor to entire questlines.\nHowever, Bethesda, the developer of Skyrim, has been known to take legal action against modders who use copyrighted material without permission. In 2019, Bethesda filed a lawsuit against a modder who had created a mod that allowed players to play as a dragon. The modder had used copyrighted material from the game’s code to create the mod.\nThe case is still ongoing, but it highlights the potential legal risks associated with modding horror games and other popular video games.\nIn conclusion, the legal gray area of horror game mods is a complex issue that requires careful consideration. While some modders have been allowed to use copyrighted material without permission, others have faced legal challenges from developers. As the gaming industry continues to evolve, it is essential to strike a balance between protecting intellectual property rights and allowing modders to create new and innovative content.\nThe debate: Preserving cultural heritage vs. copyright infringement\nWhen it comes to the legality of modding horror games, the debate between preserving cultural heritage and copyright infringement is a crucial aspect to consider. On one hand, some argue that modding horror games can be seen as a form of preserving cultural heritage. Horror games often draw inspiration from classic horror movies, books, and other forms of media, and by modding these games, developers and players can keep the genre alive and thriving. Additionally, some argue that modding can help to promote the creativity and innovation of the gaming community.\nOn the other hand, modding horror games can also be seen as a form of copyright infringement. Many horror games are protected by copyright laws, and by modifying them, developers and players could be seen as violating these laws. Furthermore, some argue that modding can lead to a dilution of the original content and experience of the game, and that it can harm the commercial interests of the game’s creators.\nIn conclusion, the debate between preserving cultural heritage and copyright infringement is a complex one, and it is important to consider both sides when examining the legality of modding horror games.\nEthical considerations of modding horror games\nRespecting the original creators’ vision\nModding a horror game can be a controversial issue as it raises ethical concerns about respecting the original creators’ vision. Many gamers believe that modifying a game, especially a horror game, is disrespectful to the developers who put in countless hours and effort into creating the original work. The developers put their heart and soul into creating a story, characters, and environments that they envisioned, and players should respect that vision.\nMoreover, modding a horror game can change the original experience that the developers intended to provide. For example, if a player mods a horror game to make it less scary, they are altering the intended experience of the game. This can be seen as disrespectful to the developers who worked hard to create a scary atmosphere that they wanted players to experience.\nHowever, others argue that modding a horror game is a form of expression and should be protected under the First Amendment. They believe that players should be allowed to modify a game as they see fit, as long as they are not causing harm to others. Additionally, some players may have different preferences or needs, such as reducing the scariness of a game for medical reasons, and modding can help them to enjoy the game in a way that works for them.\nIn conclusion, while modding a horror game can be a contentious issue, it is essential to consider the ethical implications of respecting the original creators’ vision. It is important to acknowledge the hard work and effort that developers put into creating a game, but it is also essential to recognize the right of players to express themselves through modding. Ultimately, it is up to the individual player to decide what they feel is the right thing to do.\nBalancing creative freedom and respecting intellectual property rights\nModding horror games has raised ethical concerns surrounding the balance between creative freedom and respecting intellectual property rights. The legal gray area of modding is a result of the tension between these two factors.\nCreative freedom is essential for modders to explore new ideas and expand the game’s possibilities. However, it is important to recognize that this freedom comes at a cost. The original game developers invest time, effort, and resources into creating the game, and they have the right to protect their intellectual property.\nModders must respect the intellectual property rights of the game developers, which means not infringing on their copyrights or trademarks. This includes not using copyrighted material without permission, not selling the mods for profit, and not claiming credit for the original game’s creators.\nIn conclusion, the ethical considerations of modding horror games require modders to balance their creative freedom with respecting the intellectual property rights of the game developers. This delicate balance is crucial in ensuring that modding remains a legal and ethical activity.\nFuture developments in game modding regulations\nPotential legal changes and their impact on game modding\nThe realm of game modding, particularly in the context of horror games, remains shrouded in legal ambiguity. While there have been no significant legislative amendments pertaining to modding in recent years, potential changes in intellectual property laws and copyright infringement regulations may impact the future of game modding.\n- Trademark and copyright law clarifications: The lack of a clear legal framework for protecting game mods has led to inconsistencies in the application of trademark and copyright laws. As the gaming industry continues to evolve, there may be a need for legislative intervention to provide more comprehensive protections for both game developers and modders.\n- Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) exemptions: The DMCA includes provisions that provide certain exemptions for modding, particularly for uses that are considered “fair use.” However, these exemptions are subject to periodic review and may be modified or revoked altogether. Future changes to the DMCA could significantly impact the legality of game modding.\n- Platform policies: Platforms like Steam, GOG, and consoles have their own policies regarding game modding. Changes to these policies, such as stricter enforcement of copyright infringement or a more permissive stance on modding, could significantly impact the legality and prevalence of game mods.\n- International legal developments: As game modding becomes more widespread and accessible globally, international legal developments may impact the legality of modding. For instance, the European Union’s Digital Single Market strategy could introduce new regulations that may affect game modding in the region.\n- Impact on the gaming community: Any changes to the legal landscape surrounding game modding could have far-reaching implications for the gaming community. Modding has become an integral part of the gaming experience for many players, and changes to the legality of modding could result in a backlash from the community.\nIn conclusion, while there have been no significant legislative changes impacting game modding, potential legal developments in the realm of intellectual property and copyright law could have a profound impact on the future of game modding, particularly in the context of horror games.\nIndustry perspectives and self-regulation\nThe video game industry has come a long way since the early days of gaming. As the industry continues to evolve, so too does the landscape of game modding. The question remains: how will industry perspectives and self-regulation shape the future of game modding?\nOne potential development is the increased use of digital rights management (DRM) technology to prevent modding. DRM technology is designed to control the use of digital content, such as video games, by limiting the number of times it can be copied or accessed. This technology can be used to prevent players from modifying games in ways that are not intended by the developer.\nAnother potential development is the growth of online marketplaces for mods. These marketplaces allow players to buy and sell mods, which can provide a new revenue stream for developers. However, they also raise questions about ownership and intellectual property rights. Developers may be hesitant to allow third-party mods that could potentially compete with their own products.\nFinally, the rise of virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) technology could change the way we think about game modding. These technologies allow players to experience games in new and immersive ways, which could lead to new types of mods that are designed specifically for VR and AR. However, this also raises questions about the potential impact on player safety and the need for new regulations to govern these technologies.\nIn conclusion, the future of game modding is likely to be shaped by a variety of factors, including industry perspectives, self-regulation, and technological advancements. As the industry continues to evolve, it will be important to strike a balance between allowing players to express their creativity through modding, while also protecting the rights of developers and ensuring player safety.\nThe complexity of the modding debate\nModding has been a controversial topic for many years, with developers and publishers on one side and modders on the other. While some developers see modding as a violation of their intellectual property rights, others see it as a way to expand the game’s potential and enhance the player’s experience.\nOne of the main reasons for the complexity of the modding debate is the fact that there is no clear legal framework governing game modding. While some countries have laws that protect the rights of modders, others do not. This has led to a situation where developers and publishers can take legal action against modders without fear of reprisal.\nAnother factor that contributes to the complexity of the modding debate is the fact that modding can be used for both benign and malicious purposes. While some mods are designed to enhance the game’s graphics or add new gameplay mechanics, others are designed to exploit vulnerabilities in the game’s code or steal players’ personal information.\nDespite these challenges, there are efforts underway to create a legal framework that would govern game modding. Some developers and publishers have called for a legal system that would protect their intellectual property rights while also allowing modders to create and distribute their mods. Others have proposed a system that would allow modders to use the game’s code and assets as long as they follow certain rules and guidelines.\nUltimately, the complexity of the modding debate highlights the need for a balanced approach that takes into account the interests of both developers and modders. As the gaming industry continues to evolve, it will be important to find a way to strike a balance between protecting the rights of creators and allowing players to modify and customize their games as they see fit.\nThe need for a balanced approach to modding and intellectual property rights\nModding has become an integral part of the gaming community, allowing players to customize and personalize their gaming experience. As the popularity of modding continues to grow, so does the need for a balanced approach to regulating it.\nOne of the main concerns surrounding modding is the potential infringement of intellectual property rights. Game developers invest significant time and resources into creating their games, and they may view modding as a threat to their creative control and financial interests. However, modding can also be seen as a form of user-generated content that adds value to the original game, benefiting both the developer and the player.\nA balanced approach to modding regulations would need to strike a balance between protecting the intellectual property rights of game developers and allowing players to mod their games. This could involve establishing clear guidelines for what types of mods are permissible and which ones are not, as well as creating a system for compensating developers for any unauthorized use of their intellectual property.\nAnother important consideration is the impact of modding on the gaming industry as a whole. Modding can drive innovation and create new opportunities for game developers, such as by inspiring the creation of new games or game modes. By embracing modding, developers can tap into a community of passionate and creative players who are invested in their games and can help drive their success.\nUltimately, a balanced approach to modding regulations will require a nuanced understanding of the complex relationship between intellectual property rights, player creativity, and the broader gaming industry. By striking the right balance, we can ensure that modding remains a vibrant and thriving part of the gaming community while also protecting the interests of game developers.\n1. What is game modding?\nGame modding refers to the act of modifying or altering a video game to change its features, gameplay, or visuals. This can include adding new levels, characters, or items, or changing the game’s code to create a unique experience.\n2. Is it illegal to mod a game?\nThe legality of modding a game depends on the specific circumstances and the laws of the country you are in. In general, it is not illegal to mod a game, but some mods may violate copyright or trademark laws if they use copyrighted material without permission. Additionally, some game companies may have policies against modding their games, and using mods may violate the terms of service of the game or the platform it is played on.\n3. Can I be sued for modding a game?\nIt is possible that you could be sued for modding a game if your mods violate copyright or trademark laws, or if you use copyrighted material without permission. Additionally, if you distribute your mods to others, you could be liable for copyright infringement if the mods include copyrighted material. However, the likelihood of being sued for modding a game is relatively low, and many game companies tolerate modding as long as it does not violate their policies or the law.\n4. Are there any risks associated with modding a game?\nThere are some risks associated with modding a game, particularly if you are using mods that have not been thoroughly tested or are not compatible with the game. Using mods can potentially cause the game to crash, corrupt save files, or even damage your computer. Additionally, if you are using mods that violate the terms of service of the game or the platform it is played on, you may be banned from playing the game or the platform.\n5. What are some examples of popular game mods?\nThere are many popular game mods, particularly for games like Minecraft, Skyrim, and Grand Theft Auto V. Some popular mods include adding new characters, items, or gameplay mechanics, changing the game’s visuals or sound, or creating new levels or worlds. Other mods may be more experimental, such as creating a game within a game or altering the game’s code to create a unique experience.", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}

It is basically delaying or putting things off, not being motivated enough to get started or make decisions - from the simple getting up early and having a healthy breakfast, cleaning out the kitchen drawers to making life changing decisions - procrastination can hold us back and keep us stuck in negative spirals of self-defeating lethargy. There are many reasons for procrastinating and most of them prevent us from proactively getting on with our lives; limiting beliefs, not feeling you can, or are good enough to, perfectionism, putting unrealistic expectations on ourselves, resentment, feeling forced to do things, self-doubt, and fear of failure.\nHow many times have you made a list and looked at it every day with good intentions then spend the day scrolling through social media sites, watching telly, or spend hours jumping from one web site to another looking for that elusive vase you want for your living room and end up on a site discussing Procrastination! We have all been there, I know I have many times. The internet is a wonderful invention; however, you can waste hours before achieving what you set out to do.\nAt work we don't have a choice to procrastinate and carry out our tasks daily without a second thought. However, when we get home we feel no one is forcing us or judging us and relax, doing the things we want to do (after cooking, cleaning and caring for family that is) understandable and totally allowed, however when we don't make the effort to start and complete things that need to be done whether at home or elsewhere, it does have a detrimental effect. They are there in the background niggling away at our conscience preventing us from fully enjoying whatever else we are doing instead. They build up and the clutter is not just in your house but in your mind as well. If we just spend a few minutes every day making a little start and ticking off items on our lists, we will be free to enjoy whatever we choose to do without feeling guilty that we are neglecting other areas. I am not talking ‘regimented daily routines’ here, just being more mindful and proactive in getting organised. WE ALL KNOW THAT FANTASTIC FEELING OF ACHIEVEMENT WHEN WE GET THINGS DONE, so put in a little effort and spend the rest of your day doing things you enjoy.\nTake the time to mindfully carry out tasks one at a time, don't try to multi-task.

The philosophy behind this tidbit is easy\nThe same axiom can apply to your home office. Is it tucked in a dark corner of the spare bedroom? Is your desk beside a bed covered in old toys? Is your filing\ncabinet stuffed in the closet under clothes? If your home office doesn't feel professional and uplifting, how productive and happy can you be\nspending eight or more hours a day there?\nDecorating your home office isn't an art, but following some basic principles of office design can help create an organized, effective and productivity-enhancing space.\nChoose a wall color that facilitates focus.\nEven if your home office will be in the guest room that you just painted last year, it may be a good idea to repaint. Not only does a fresh coat of paint make a room feel energized and new,\nrepainting gives you the opportunity to put a color on the wall that's office-appropriate.\nIn an interview by Chris Bailey of the blog \"A Life of Productivity,\" color psychologist and author Angela Wright suggests that your home office color scheme needs to match the type of work you do because different colors create different effects. For example, Wright says, blue might\nbe stimulating if you do a lot of mental work in your home office. Additionally, yellow could\nencourage creativity, and green might be soothing if your work is particularly stressful and\nbalance is important.\nLuxuriate in light.\n\"You are stuck in your office – albeit at home – all day, working and slaving away, staring at the same wall and some bland office furniture you got at a garage sale,\" writes Herman Chan in Home Business Magazine. \"Spending all those hours in the same spot, it would behoove you to splurge on one luxury piece.\" Chan suggests an inspiring piece of furniture, but you can also\ncreate a luxe effect – with only a modest \"splurge\" – by decorating with lighting elements such as a skylight.\nAdd a solar-powered fresh air skylight and an energy-efficient solar-powered blind to your home office and the products, as well as the installation, can be eligible for a 30 percent federal tax credit as a green home improvement.\nIf your home office happens to be located in a renovated attic space, roof windows, which are very much like skylights but are in-reach, can offer natural light and fresh air plus access to the roof for debris removal, maintenance or for emergency access.\nOrganize with attractive storage.\nIf your idea of home office storage includes the cardboard boxes you used to transport files from the last job you had outside your home, it's time to revisit your organizational plan. A cluttered, disorganized home office can cause you to misplace important documents and can make you feel overwhelmed.\nAs more people have begun working from home, office furniture manufacturers have branched out from the sterile-looking metal storage units ubiquitous in workplaces across the country. Today, it's easy to find attractive storage options that fit with virtually any home office decor.\nIf you just can't find a file cabinet that speaks to your soul, why not try some alternative storage options? Move that beautiful sideboard you inherited from grandma – that just never fit anywhere else in your house – into your home office and use it for filing. Not in love with any of the desk options available at your local office store? Hit an antique shop and find an antique desk or even a dining table that you adore. Remember to keep furnishings and storage solutions size-appropriate for the room so your home office doesn't feel crowded.\nWorking from home offers many advantages, including the opportunity to decorate your home\noffice the way you want.

The problem here is that the normal meaning of the word in British English is “authorise”. The difference, I suppose, is that while both usages are transitive, the AmE usage may be to mandate something, while the BrE usage is only to mandate someone to do something – which AE can also have. So when we read that President Biden has mandated an organisation to enforce the wearing of masks, I wonder why this is so contentious, because to me, the meaning of this sentence is that he has authorised that organisation to enforce mask wearing if it wishes to. The use of notify, however, while it may sound wrong to AmE speakers, at least is not confusing – there is no other meaning of notify.\nSanction is another word with confusing uses. And in this case, the two uses are diametrically opposed. The earliest example quoted in OED is its use as a noun in 1570, where it refers to an ecclesiastical decree (with no sense of either condemnation or approval). Within a hundred years this had become “the penalty enacted in order to enforce obedience to a law”, but at the same time a sanction could now also be the reward for obeying a law (quotations given from 1696 and 1692 respectively).\nSince at least the 18th century, a further extension of its meaning has become “something which serves to support, authorize, or confirm an action, procedure, etc.”, with an example from 1727. It is an easy step from there to “permission”.\nInterestingly, OED has a quotation from Richard Baxter (1651): “The Law hath two parts, the mandate and the sanction.” Interpret that as you wish!", "scores": {"score": 3, "score_transform_1": 5, "score_transform_2": 5, "score_transform_3": 0}}

If you’re not a frequent user, the lasting effect may be out of your system by then. But then again, there’s an off chance it won’t.\nAdding to that dilemma, if the test is positive, does it really mean you are under the influence? Not likely, unless you used maybe six hours prior.\nSome people might even argue, “In that case, does it really matter anyway?”\nIt might matter to your employer. Or a judge. Or your mom.\nWhat word you choose for marijuana generally can indicate if you are using it for a medical reason or recreationally.\nSomeone with a chronic health condition is more likely to say medical marijuana or cannabis than someone relaxing at home from a long week hitting a joint.\nBut if you are facing drug testing based on legal consequences, job requirements, or family demands, a positive or negative test can mean the difference between guilty and not guilty. Understanding the nuances that affect results is important for both the tester and the one being tested.\nDrug Tests Have Multiple Purposes\nBut different outlets care in different circumstances about IF you use marijuana. For example:\n- Whether it is legal or not in your state to use marijuana, it is NOT within the law to drive while impaired from any substance. Therefore, police and the court systems will want to uphold the law and may require urine samples if you are charged with driving under the influence.\n- Maybe it’s parents of an underage child worried about their school grades going down and their new group of friends. They may choose to go to a pharmacy to purchase an over-the-counter test to use at home the next time their son or daughter breaks curfew.\n- Employers often have a drug-use policy for various reasons:\n- Either there is heavy equipment being operated, and they must ensure the environment is safe, or they believe working under the influence makes you less productive.\n- Or maybe it has to do with their health insurance plan, and one person’s actions affect the other employees’ costs.\n- Some employers, perhaps in childcare, may consider it an indicator of your character, and worry about who is supervising children in the facility.\n- For federal workers, a marijuana metabolite level cutoff is 50 ng/mL. Other private or public employers may have a no-tolerance policy, a suspension period, or other strike-out enforcement.\n- Schools and sports associations often enforce drug screens if they are publicly owned and therefore liable by local and state laws, or are worried about breaking association rules by which players must abide if they want to participate.\nAll of these factors take into consideration the possible effects one person’s marijuana use may have on others. Therefore, there are multiple types of tests and multiple reasons they are required.\nTesting Can Prove Wrong Behavior AND Give an Inaccurate Reflection of Circumstance\nMarijuana being in someone’s system doesn’t necessarily mean they are under the influence. That is due to what part of your body marijuana impacts. It is generally stored in the fatty areas and therefore days/weeks/even months have been known to pass and still, a test will be positive depending on the amount and frequency of use—even the percentage of body fat.\nBut cognitively, they may pass all standard physical response time tests, in say, a roadside stop by a police officer. That is because maybe they last used marijuana about two weeks prior but would still test positive.\nThe longer-range of time is more of interest to prove the use of a substance if it is illegal. This may come into play, for example, during someone’s probation time when they are typically required by the court to abstain from alcohol and drugs.\nIt doesn’t matter if they are legally able to order a drink; the court requirement supersedes any ability to consume the alcohol. This may be due to concern about addiction or be a punitive action in light of an infraction (think here in terms of an adult being reprimanded and punished for their behavior).\nMarijuana and Metabolism Challenge Clinical Testing\nThe following variables come into play when considering how long marijuana stays in your system:\n- THC (tetrahydrocannabinol) level\n- How it is consumed (inhaled smoke from leaves, concentrates, extracts, or oils vs. consumed as edible\n- Edibles (food such as gummies or brownies or drinks such as tea)\n- Inhaled through a joint, vape pen, or water bong (even how deeply it is inhaled and how long it is held in)\n- Frequency of consumption\nMetabolism Plays a Critical Role for Cannabis Processing\nAccording to Dr. Robert Mann of the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, in a 2019 Global News article, “When you use cannabis, the THC gets absorbed into the fat in your body, and so there’s kind of a reservoir there that keeps getting released fairly slowly, so that you will find trace amounts of THC in the blood for a longer period but at very low levels.”\nMarijuana binds to receptors in the brain and organs, as well as becoming absorbed in body fat. The introduction of synthetic marijuana, also known as spice or K-2, has complicated things. While this is not marijuana, but dangerous and unknown chemicals sprayed on plants, it also binds to these cannabinoid receptors. It has a more powerful effect but is also more unpredictable and life-threatening.\nTypes of Marijuana Testing\nThere are a few dynamics that determine whether you will undergo a blood or urine test:\n- How quickly the results are needed\n- If the test site is set up to handle multiple appointments\n- Ability to process urine/blood samples\n- Precision of results\n- Test expense\nClinical Studies Provide Limited Detection Data\nThere is somewhat limited clinical data of studies that have analyzed detection times, leaving the answers up to individual cases. And of those studies, many are decades old.\nUrine: One 1985 study did determine the presence of marijuana through urinalysis 24 days after last use in a chronic case. The Mayo Clinic Proceedings, an online publication, released a 2017 article Clinical Interpretation of Urine Drug Tests. What Clinicians Need To Know About Urine Drug Screens.\nIt pointed to a single-use case that detected marijuana 72 hours later.\nBlood: One case detected marijuana in the blood 30 days after last use.\nSaliva: As stated above, it rates third in line for how far back it can trace use, which is generally 5 to 48 hours. Chronic users may be identified later.\nHair Follicle: A hair test can accurately analyze a sample for up to 90 days with accuracy.\nMarijuana Testing Accuracy Has Several Flaws\nAccording to the journal Therapeutic Drug Monitoring, in 2004 it published an article regarding the types of drug test administered, “in general, the detection time is longest in hair, followed by urine, sweat, oral fluid, and blood.”\nReferred to medically as immunoassay tests, urine tests can confirm or deny if marijuana is detected. It cannot indicate how much marijuana is present. Inaccuracies may cause false positives with this fairly quick and less expensive test.\nThe test results can undergo further analysis with a gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GCMS) follow-up. Rarely will a GCMS result in a false positive. However, both a urine screen and a GCMS analysis can give a negative result, even if there is drug use and even if it was the same day.\nUsing a syringe to retrieve a blood sample generally proves to be more accurate than a urine test. Blood tests can gauge a better result for marijuana concentration levels in addition to confirming whether marijuana is even present.\nA mouth swab is an easy way to administer a test for marijuana. Both parties are in full view of each other, and possibly others, so evidence-tampering is minimal. For this reason, they are growing in popularity with some police agencies and job sites.\nTHC can be detected in breast milk from a nursing mother. If detected, doctors are required to report suspicion of cannabis use to the local department of family and children’s services.\nHair Follicle Test\nAnalyzing a hair sample can detect whether marijuana is present and typically gives the longest window of possible use. On the other hand, if marijuana was only used in the previous week and not earlier, due to hair growth it most likely cannot be detected. Because the test analyzes the follicle, hair dye or other products won’t alter the results.\nA Friends Research Institute 2015 study of 360 self-reported adult marijuana users found the hair test to be 52.3% accurate.\nTests to check for marijuana can be ordered online or purchased from drug stores or supermarkets over-the-counter. These at-home tests were given the okay by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1997.\nWhile regulated for production quality, the tests may be\n- Manipulated or tampered with if the sample is not supervised throughout the process\n- Administered by an untrained professional\n- Affected by collecting sample too early or too late for accuracy\nWho uses these tests? Some people may want to do a self-check of their results before going to a testing site. Other times, a parent or spouse may ask a child or partner to complete a test if there is suspicion of use.\nOffice settings where urine tests are undergone have been growing as onsite point-of-care-testing. This is done to ensure compliance by the person seeking treatment promised by the provider. While they are cleared by the FDA, they are sometimes subject to fewer requirements and might use subjective visual analysis to evaluate sample coloring. In this situation, the simple presence or absence of a substance is the typical standard of data collection.\nDrug Results Rely on a Trained Eye for Evaluation\nSomeone worried about a drug test result can become desperate in their attempt to conceal their marijuana use.\n- It could cost them their job and bring financial consequences or public humiliation.\n- A teen may be terrified of their parents’ reactions and possible punishments.\n- Someone on probation may be at risk of serving a suspended jail sentence.\nUnfortunately, this fear mindset might make them do something they wouldn’t ordinarily consider. They may have been at a party and someone passed them a joint, and in a moment of recklessness they chose to participate, not thinking about the after-effects.\nNow, they’re seriously considering altering their urine sample by drinking vinegar or even detergent, eating table salt, or buying an online masking agent such as the aptly named Urine Luck.\nSomeone familiar with urine’s normal pH level and creatinine levels would be able to identify if they’re working with a usable sample.\nFinding Inpatient Marijuana Drug Rehab for Recovery\nIt’s not news that the opinions of legalization and use of marijuana are evolving based on the philosophy it can have medical merit and successfully be used for harmless recreation. But like anything, overindulgence is not helpful when done consistently.\nWhen considering the nuances involved with accurate testing, you should also consider if marijuana use is affecting your life:\n- Does it cause you to make poor decisions such as driving under the influence?\n- Is your wallet being drained to support your habit?\n- Is chronic use making you ill, specifically to the point of inducing vomit? Do you continue to use marijuana knowing you will be ill?\n- Do you experience withdrawal symptoms such as sleep problems, irritability, anxiousness, depression, or decreased appetite?\n- Do you have problems in your social, work, or school life due to use?\n- Do you use larger amounts for longer periods than intended? Is it difficult to cut back?\nThese are some examples, but not all of the criteria, used when considering cannabis use disorder diagnosis.\nIf you are concerned about your use or that of someone you love, reach out about marijuana rehab, we understand these are murky waters you are navigating. By calling now to discuss your unique situation, we can begin to assess you and share our care plan strategies. We have a long-standing reputation of being a quality, evidence-based drug rehab center. Let us help you and your family.\nHow long can marijuana be detected in a urine test, and can you avoid detection?\nIf you rarely use marijuana vs. being a chronic user, it will significantly affect your urine test. You may test positive three days after one-time use and negative the next day. If you use it frequently, it can be detected in your urine weeks later. Attempts to dilute urine or change the pH by adding solutions may just make the test inconclusive and a retake can be ordered.\nHow long is the detection window for marijuana?\nIn order of testing methods, a hair sample is the longest detection period and can show use up to 90 days after marijuana has been consumed. One-time use of marijuana can be detected roughly three days after use through urine or blood. Oddly enough, a hair test might show a negative result for a one-time use within seven days because of the growth rate.\nHow long does it take to have a clean marijuana mouth swab detection time?\nWhile a saliva test can detect marijuana within 30 minutes of use, its window is relatively short and generally can no longer be detected after 48 hours.", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}

Anglers Paradise was founded by Zyg Gregorek over forty years ago and has undoubtedly sowed the seeds for many anglers who have visited the venue with their families. On Easter Sunday 2022 I attended a family fun fishing day at the day ticket Eldorado complex that was supported by Anglers Paradise, The Angling Trust, Shakespeare, Angling Direct, The Environment Agency, Dynamite Baits and Nash Tackle.\nZenia Drury Gregorek was undoubtedly the driving force behind the event that attracted over seventy eager participants. Coaches from the Angling Trust were joined by keen local anglers to introduce families to the joys of angling. All tackle and bait was provided at this free event with a wealth of expert advice on tap for both total beginners and the more experienced angler. All juniors who took part earned a Get Fishing Certificate Award and badge from the Angling Trust presented by Dean Asplin who is Angling Development Manager for the South of England and South West Angling Development Officer.\nI arrived at the venue shortly before the start and enjoyed chatting with the coaches who had travelled from far and wide to assist and support on the day. Amongst the coaches were Roly, Tony King, John Thompson, Andy Payne, Joe Drury, Hassan Khan, Steve Manley, Dan Murrell, Joe Dietrich, Callum Regan and Mark Thorneycroft.\nIt was to prove a busy day for the coaches with families descending on the venue from far and wide. The event was blessed with warm sunshine during the morning session with the sounds of children’s laughter and adults banter filling the spring air. A few swallows swooped over the water as the coaches explained the finer details of fishing. The majority of families gathered around a lake stocked with a wide variety of smaller fish with whips used in conjunction with float tactics. The young anglers were fascinated by the brightly coloured wriggly maggots and soon focussed upon the brightly coloured floats that bobbed optimistically upon the water to disappear delightfully from time to time as a bejewelled fish from another dimension was lifted from the cloudy waters.\nMany caught their first fish and it was great to see the joy and fascination upon so many faces. The coaches gave guidance on how to unhook the fish carefully and return them to the water with minimal harm.\nOn the lower Lake Hassan Khan of Nash Tackle was joined by Steve Manley and Dan Murrell of Catch to explain the complexities and technicalities of carp fishing. During the morning session the carp showed on the surface in abundance allowing Hassan and his friends to demonstrate the frustration of carp fishing as the carp ignored the carefully presented hook baits. They made up for this in the afternoon session helping a young angler to bank two fine double figure carp.\nThe event proved a huge success with many families being introduced to angling for the first time. For some this could prove the gateway to a lifetime spent in the great outdoors gaining an in depth appreciation of nature. Angling is recognised as providing a great deal of well-being with significant benefits for mental health.\nDuring the day I attempted to capture a few images of the fishing that will hopefully do more justice than words alone.", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}
{"id": "8861", "text": "Invasive Alien Species (IAS) is known as one of the main threats leading to biodiversity loss. Addressing concerns caused by IAS is crucial because the threat is ever increasing and the impacts on our environment can be severe, if not managed. The most cost effective way to deal with the impacts of invasive species is to prevent invasions before they even occur. Not many are aware of the impacts invasive alien species can have on our local biodiversity and environment. This is a good opportunity to share knowledge on non-native species and engage the community in helping to prevent the spread of invasive alien species in our ecosystem.\nOutline of contents\nWhat is an Invasive Alien Species?\n‘Alien species’ refers to plants, animals and microorganisms that are exotic, non-native, introduced or non-indigenous, with respect to a particular ecosystem. They become invasive when accidentally or deliberately introduced to new areas beyond their native ranges, and are able to survive, reproduce, and then spread and cause a negative impact on local biodiversity (Tu, 2009). Generally, the spread of an IAS involves four stages: Introduction, Establishment, Invasion and Spread.\nWhy are they a problem?\nInvasive Alien Species can cause negative impacts at the species, population and community levels, and the most significant harm is altering ecosystem functions. Invasive alien species can potentially caused a range of problems such as the following:\n- Threaten the survival of native plants and animals by competing for resources - Alter vegetation structures and community composition, thus upsetting the ecosystems balance - Spread easily if not managed properly\n- Costly to control if not managed properly\n- Endanger human health if organisms harbour foreign pests and diseases\n- Hydridise with native species, resulting in negative genetic impacts\nHow are they introduced?\nAlien species can be introduced via 2 means: a) Unintentional & b) Intentional.\nAn unintentional introduction occurs as a result of accidental or unplanned means, utilising humans or human delivery systems as vectors for dispersal outside its natural range.\nAn intentional introduction is a deliberate introduction of an alien species by humans, involving the purposeful movement of a species outside of its natural range and dispersal potential.\n(Ref: IUCN Guidelines for the Prevention of Biodiversity Loss caused by Alien Invasive Species, 2000)\nExamples of unintentional introduction\n- Ballast water releases from ships, hull fouling\n- Organisms in or on timber/wood products, in packing materials and shipping containers/cargos\n- In or on various modes of transportation like cars, trucks, boats, airplanes, ships, etc\n- Organisms in imported nursery soils\n- Organisms in imported fruits and vegetables\n- Tourists and their luggage/equipment\nExamples of intentional introduction\n- Release of unwanted pets and aquarium animals into the wild (e.g. Red-eared Slider)\n- Plants introduced for gardens/landscaping\n- Biological control (e.g. House Crow)\nApart from preventing the introduction of alien species, one of the actions taken to prevent the spread of invasions is to identify the pathways through which invasive alien species arrive.\nManaging non-native: How is Singapore dealing with the issue?\nLaws and Regulations\nThe use of legislation is an important component in the management of alien species. A set of legislation administered by different government agencies are used to facilitate the management and preventing the spread of non-native in Singapore. Listed here are the relevant Acts under administration by the respective agencies\nAnimals and Birds Act\nRegulates the import, export and transshipment of animals\nRegulates the feeding, release, killing, trapping, taking, keeping, sale, import, and export of wildlife\nControl of Plants Act\nRegulates import and export of plants and plant products\nEndangered Species (Import and Export) Act\nRegulates trade in endangered species of plants and plant products\nParks and Trees Act\nRegulates the planting, maintenance and conservation of trees and plants within national parks, nature reserves, tree conservation areas, heritage road, green buffers and other specified areas. The Act also specifies that release of animal is prohibited in the nature reserve.\nPrevention of pollution of the sea Act\nRegulates the prevention of sea pollution, whether originating from land or from ships (with reference to ballast water).\nNParks actively clears exotic plant species from Singapore’s forests. Over the years, exotic plants, mostly climbers and creepers, have been thriving along the rainforest edges and are a threat to the native plant species. These creepers strangle trees, and often cause their collapse during heavy thunderstorms because of the intertwining creepers that connect several trees together. In addition, the creepers also compete with saplings of native plants for space. Hence, there is an urgent need to manage these exotic species before they penetrate further into the rainforest.\nIn 1997, a project was undertaken by NParks to remove exotic species along a 3km stretch of rainforest, at the edge of the Central Catchment Nature Reserve (CCNR). Most of the trees were badly covered by climbers and creepers, including exotic species such as mile-a-minute (Mikania micrantha).\nOnce an area has been cleared of exotic species, it is earmarked for reforestation. Together with the help of students and volunteer groups, NParks carries out reforestation activities and ensures that only native plants are replanted.\nSchools and other public and private organisations also contribute towards the maintenance and management of the nature reserves by adopting patches of land. This serves as an opportunity for students and the general public to learn about ecology and the experience of managing an ecosystem. Students also take this opportunity to carry out simple research on reforestation techniques.\nClick here to read an article on the management of an invasive plant species, Dioscorea sansibarensis, at the Singapore Botanic Gardens.\nOne of the ways to minimise the release of non-native is through public education. Members of the public can increase their knowledge on the potential impacts of non-native species on our local biological diversity and ecosystems by obtaining information through talks, brochures, internet and books. Do your part by sharing what you know on invasive alien species with your family, friends and neighbours. Spread the word around so that more people can understand the damage caused by invasive alien species.\n“Operation No Release” is a programme targeted at discouraging the “mercy” release of animals or unwanted pets into parks and nature reserves. This programme came about in response to the problem of members of the public releasing animals (often into the CCNR) to gain merit, especially during the annual Vesak Day. Though releasing of animals on Vesak Day is a well-intentioned act of kindness, those who practise this fail to realise that they are doing more harm to the animals as well as upsetting the ecological balance. It is especially detrimental to our local ecosystem when the release involves alien species that can negatively affect local biodiversity. One of the popular animals released is the red-eared slider, which can be easily bought from the local aquarium shops or markets.\nIn order to heighten awareness on the problems associated with releasing animals, NParks together with AVA, PUB, Nature Society (Singapore), students from various schools and volunteer groups conduct educational and outreach activities. These activities include talks, exhibitions and producing/distributing brochures, are often carried out before Vesak Day. On Vesak Day itself, NParks rangers and volunteers station themselves at popular release sites around the CCNR to discourage members of the public from releasing animals. The Public Utilities Board (PUB) also plays an important role here by educating the public on the detrimental effects on our water quality if the released animals are released into the reservoirs.\nSince the initiation of this programme, there has been a noticeable decrease in the number of animal releases. Alternative ways of performing good deeds have been suggested such as planting suitable native trees. The general public are also now becoming better informed of the consequences of animal release into our nature reserves and reservoirs.\nWhat you can do to help?\nPrevention is better than cure! The best way to stop alien species from spreading is to stop them from arriving and establishing themselves in a new ecosystem. All of us can do our part to help stop and prevent the introduction and spread of these harmful invaders by following these helpful tips:\nHere are some tips on controlling spread of alien species for gardening, pets and during travel.\n- Avoid buying or growing plants that are known to be invasive such as Ceropia. Replace any invasive plants in your garden with non-invasive plants which are native.\n- Use native plants to landscape your garden. Although non-native plants are not necessarily invasive, and can usually be grown without risk, growing natives can provide bonuses such as food, cover, nesting sites for birds and butterflies.\n- Avoid planting of exotic garden shrubs but if you do so, avoid planting them next to, or within nature reserves and natural areas.\n- Learn which plants are invasive and remove them from your garden.\n- Avoid dumping unwanted plants in a nearby park or natural area. Invasive plants can spread very easily from plant fragments, seeds and berries.\n- Buy from reputable pet dealers whose non-native pets have proper labels, legally imported and not harbouring foreign pests and diseases that can spread to native wildlife.\n- Avoid releasing aquarium fish into natural water bodies, such as ponds, reservoirs, or natural streams. Some ornamental fish can establish themselves in the wild with deleterious effects on native biodiversity. If you do not want your pet fish, return it to a local pet shop for resale or give it to another hobbyist, or donate it to a school. Be a responsible pet owner.\n- Avoid releasing other pets, either. Some pet amphibians and reptiles may prey on a wide variety of native species and others may carry diseases. Most domesticated pets such as rabbits and hamsters are not able to survive if release into the wild and may carry diseases, which may have an impact on local biodiversity.\n- Avoid carrying seeds, live plants, fruit, vegetables, soil, insects, lizards, snails, or other animals into or out of the country. Travelling with these biological items can add to the spread of exotic species from one ecosystem to another.\n- Abide by local and international quarantines to prevent the spread of serious insect pests, weeds and diseases.\n- Share the knowledge about the potential damage caused by invasives with your friends, family, neighbours and colleagues at work.\n- Learn to recognise common invasives and keep a look out for signs of new ones. The best way to tackle a potential invasive problem is early detection and stopping them from becoming permanently established.\nNote: The list above was collated from sources such as Invasive Alien Species: A threat to biodiversity produced by CBD.\nWant to learn more about IAS?\nHere is a list of materials and websites pertaining to IAS if you want to find out more.\nConvention on Biological Diversity – Invasive Alien Species\nGlobal Invasive Species Database\nInternational Day for Biological Diversity 2009 – Invasive Alien Species\nThe World Conservation Union (IUCN) - Invasive Species Specialist Group\nBrook, B.W., Sodhi, N.S., Soh, M.C.K. & Lim, H.C.

{"id": "8922", "text": "The case in question – Gifting for the purpose of property finance\nThis situation is likely to be one that is more common. The parents had given funds to their daughter and the daughter’s life partner of many years in the amount of around € 100k. This was used for co-financing a residential property that had been jointly acquired by the beneficiaries. Less than two years after the gifting had occurred the couple separated. Thereafter, the parents sought to reclaim from the former life partner his respective share of the gift and succeeded in doing so – in the final instance, the Federal Court of Justice ruled in their favour (judgement from 18.6.2019, case reference: X R 107/16).\nDoes the basis of a transaction cease to exist in the case of a separation?\nThe court did nevertheless clarify that a donor basically bears the risk that the future lifestyle of a beneficiary and what s/he does with the gift will not conform to the expectations of the donor. However, the case should be judged differently if the donor’s expectations had discernibly become the transactional basis for the gift. If this ceases to exist then there is justification for cancelling the transaction.\nGifting property ownership, or amounts of money intended for this purpose, to a child and his/her partner is usually borne by the expectation that, in any case, the property will be used jointly as a family home by the beneficiaries for a certain amount of time. That was also the court’s assessment of the issue in the case in question. The parents’ expectations became the transactional basis for the gift and this as eliminated by the separation that occurred shortly afterwards. The conditions for cancelling a transaction had thus been satisfied.\nPlease note: On the question of the period of time for which a relationship has to last in order to be able to deny that the basis of a transaction has ceased to exist, the court implied that, in this respect, it wished to base its decision on case law pertaining to marriages of short duration under maintenance law. Accordingly, periods of up to two years would always be viewed as being of (too) short duration and a period of more than three years always as long enough.\nLegal rights to demand the return of a gift\nApart from the basis of a transaction ceasing to exist, there are two further regulated possibilities for demanding that a gift be returned.\n- Impoverishment of the donor (Section 528 German Civil Code (Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch, BGB) – A donor, following the gifting, finds him/herself in a position where s/he is unable to reasonably provide for him/herself or to meet the maintenance obligation incumbent upon him/her by law.\n- Gross ingratitude of the beneficiary (Section 530 BGB) in the form of serious wrongs done to the donor or a close relative of the donor, e.g., physical ill treatment or serious insults.\nRecommendations: Set out the contractual rights to demand the return of a gift...\nTo counter the uncertainty of whether or not the rights to demand the return of a gift would be pertinent it would be advisable, in the gift agreement, to lay down specific criteria for demanding the return of the gift in special circumstances. Typical cases could be, e.g.,\n- beneficiary dies before the donor;\n- insolvency of the beneficiary;\n- beneficiary needs a carer;\n- beneficiary sells the gift without the consent of the donor.\n... protect against tax risks\nSometimes people also forget to protect against the tax risks of gifting that arise from the rights to demand the return of a gift. This is particularly the case where business assets are gifted. The parties involved usually assume that gift tax is not applicable here because of gift tax exemptions. However, the conditions for exemptions are complicated and include a number of risks, e.g., with respect to non-operating assets that are harmful from a tax point of view. It is therefore advisable, as a precaution, to likewise provide for the possibility to demand the return of a gift if, contrary to expectations, gift tax is triggered. If the right were exercised then gift tax would expire retroactively. Moreover, re-transferring would not constitute gifting again.", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}

{"id": "8973", "text": "Patient identification errors are nothing new – everyone in the U.S. knows what it is and by now how it is affecting those who are unfortunate enough to be misidentified, thanks to the numerous reports, surveys, and researches conducted regarding this topic. However, what everyone is now demanding thanks to all these studies is a unique patient identifier.\nLet’s jog our memories for a moment. Patient identification errors have been abundant in the healthcare industry since its inception. However, these patient matching errors are at an all-time high now, thanks to EHR related issues like unintuitive interfaces, interoperability issues, and low patient match rates within the systems themselves. It is quite problematic for the healthcare providers as patient misidentification causes losses of millions of dollars per year and problems like physician burnouts due to unintuitive EHR systems. But that’s not all; patients suffer, as well – financially, physically, or both – they very likely may receive the wrong treatment, undergo incorrect surgical procedures, and in some cases, may face death. It is a multibillion-dollar issue of the healthcare system and causes suffering to everyone who comes into contact with it like a plague. In the early days, nobody used to pay much attention to this, but now, thanks to numerous reports, statistics, and data available to the public, everyone knows how much of a problem inaccurate patient identification is.\nHowever, recent developments seem to point to a brighter future for patients and healthcare providers alike. CHIME, also known as College of Healthcare Information Management Executives and the American Health Information Management Association (AHIMA) members pushed the US Senate to demolish the ancient ban regarding a unique patient identifier which could be used nationwide, following the House of Representatives’ decision.\nKey individuals from reputed organizations like CHIME and AHIMA, which are full of healthcare IT experts, demonstrated to Congress the benefits of demolishing this ban on a unique patient identifier. The abolishment of this ban would result in the U.S. Dept. of Health & Human Services to work in tandem with private organizations to research and find a unique patient identifier which will help to create accurate patient identification while keeping in mind patient privacy – or does it exist already?\nHowever, the supporters for lifting the ban were not only AHIMA and CHIME – the American College of Surgeons as well as the American Medical Informatics Association chimed in as well, no pun intended. Jointly, they all demonstrated to the Senate the current challenges they face due to patient misidentification and what types of problems the patients might face due to these errors like wrong treatments, financial losses, and so on. Adding to the list was incomplete patient data in EHRs and duplicate records, as well, which results in the reduction of data integrity. A recognized healthcare professional stated that the employees of health systems have the first-hand experience of seeing the implications of patient matching errors and how it adversely affects not only the patients, but also their families. He further said that inaccurate patient matching is one of the sole reasons for hampering patient safety as well as generating extremely high costs, falling in line with all the studies and statistics related to patient matching errors. To put things into perspective, a single patient matching error costs around $1000-$5000 to fix, depending on the complexity of the issue for any given healthcare provider. All this is happening while everyone within the industry as well the Congress is doing their very best to reduce healthcare expenses. However, this will only be possible nationwide if the ban is demolished, and a unique patient identifier is selected.\nBut why has everyone been so late to tackle this issue? Well, they weren’t – it was addressed before, but was dismissed. Decades ago, HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) required a unique patient identifier for utilizing its full potential, but it did not materialize due to privacy concerns. Rules were later added, which banned the HHS from developing a unique patient identifier using federal funds. It has come full circle, as everyone is clamoring for a unique patient identifier now.\nHowever, let’s go back to the past again. As healthcare providers were rapidly adopting EHR systems, they were also experiencing the many problems associated with using them. Thus, they had to resort to other methods to accurately identify their patients, decreasing their reliance on EHR systems.\nWhat should be the unique patient identifier?\nEveryone related to the healthcare industry is urging for the creation of a unique patient identifier. What if it exists right now? Over a hundred health systems are using RightPatient – a biometric patient identification system. RightPatient focuses on iris scanning, which is beneficial for everyone involved – it eliminates any risk of catching diseases as it is a non-contact modality and is very easy to use for the patients. All a patient needs to do is look at the camera, and the patient is quickly and accurately matched with his or her health record. It is also reducing losses for its users by reducing denied claims. The health systems have also been reporting promising results like improved patient safety, and enhanced patient experience. It is also causing fewer physician burnouts – they can focus on the patients rather than spending time matching the patients with their EHRs, because RightPatient does it for them. Thus, as such a tried and tested solution as RightPatient exists, it seems to be a viable candidate for being the unique patient identifier of the U.S. healthcare industry.", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}

{"id": "8987", "text": "Are your solar panels mounted in a fixed position? Are you currently installing solar panels and want to get the most power output from them?\nIf so, then you should considered installing an adjustable solar panel mount, so you can change the solar panel angle throughout the year, or even throughout the day as the sun moves across the sky.\nAdjusting the angle of your solar panels is the best way to gain more power without spending extra money on expensive solar panels! Keep reading to find out the top 8 reasons why you should install an adjustable mount today.\n1. Save Money\nSaving money is our number one reason to install an adjustable solar mount. Instead of buying more solar panels, an adjustable mount will allow you to change the angle of the solar panel throughout the year and increase the total amp hours in a given day.\nA 100 watt solar panel costs around $150 online, while an adjustable mount can be purchased for around $50. In the long run, adjusting the solar panel angle with the changing seasons, will save money and can pay for the mount in less than a year due to the increased power output.\n2. Minimize Effects of Harsh Weather\nSevere weather can be hard on solar panels, especially snow, hail and strong winds. With an adjustable solar panel mount, it is easy to lower the panel flat against the surface it is mounted. This helps minimize the wind load and prevents damage. When a solar panel is laid flat, it is also easier to cover and protect by a sturdy object.\n3. Increase Solar Panel Power Output\nSolar panel current output is dictated by the “cosine effect”. That is, the amount of current from a solar panel depends on the sun angle.\nWhen the sun is perpendicular to the panel, a 0 degree sun angle, the panel will produce the most power. The cosine of 0 degrees is 1, meaning full output.\nAny angle greater than 0 degrees will decrease the current output. By adjusting the solar panel angle and achieving a sun angle as close to zero, will produce the most amount of power.\nSay you need to charge you batteries in the afternoon. Adjusting the mount so the solar panels are perpendicular to the sun, will ensure your batteries are charged for nighttime operation.\n4. Reduce View Obstructions\nLet’s face it, solar panel are not the most beautiful thing to look at. With an adjustable solar panel mount, it is possible to lay the panels flat and eliminate the view obstruction. Maybe you are parked in Yosemite Valley or another wilderness area, being able to get the solar panels out of sight can be a great thing.\nWith adjustable solar panel mounts you will be able to raise them in the morning to charge batteries and lay them flat in the evening when you want to sit outside and enjoy the view.\n5. Increase Transportability\nIf your solar panels are mounted on an RV or other vehicle at a fixed angle greater than flat against the roof, this can greatly decrease gas mileage. You may not even realize how much this is affecting gas mileage.\nA minor reduction in gas millage of 0.5 MPG due to solar panels over 10,000 miles a year can cost over a hundred dollar a year in additional gasoline, much less than purchasing an adjustable solar panel mount.\nThe best thing to do before driving, is to lay the panels flat against the roof of the vehicle. This improves gas mileage and helps reduce the chances of damaging the solar panel.\n6. Maximize Power Output for a Fixed Surface Area\nMost of the time solar panels are installed in area with a fixed amount of surface area. Be it the roof of a RV, travel trailer, shed, etc… In these cases only so many solar panels can fit in the given area. Your only option to increase power output will be to install an adjustable mount. By adjusting the solar panel angles, you will be able to optimize your area usage and maximize the power output.\n7. Park in the Shade\nSolar panels mounted in a fixed position of the roof of a car are usually difficult to remove to place in the sun. Because of this, most people have to part in the sun, which can drive air conditional usage.\nMost solar panel tilt mounts are easy to remove from the roof of a vehicle and with an extension cable can be moved into the sun. This allows the vehicle to part in the shade with the solar panels located out in the sun, decreasing air conditioner usage.\n8. Don’t Buy Mounting Hardware Twice\nThere is a motto, “Buy once, cry once”. Spending the money to buy an adjustable mount upfront instead of upgrading later will save you money in the long run. You will likely want to upgrade to an adjustable mount within the first year, so save your money and start with a high quality adjustable mount from the get go.", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}

Right now I'm trying to stop myself from working on anything else until Cersei is actually complete, but a couple new projects for other people have popped up unexpectedly and I might have to break for them :/ In any case, my instagram (@maishericostumes) is the place to look for current progress updates until I have more time to post collections here.\nI've gotten back several sets of photos from photographers recently which I will be posting soon (I hope!!!) because they're gorgeous, so that'll be the next few blogs.\nAs for events: I thought that I was going to be finished for the year after Fan Expo, but I just can't turn down working with Cosplay for a Cure, so I will be with them at the Niagara Wine Festival parade again this year (Sept 24), as well as Hamilton Comic Con (Oct 1-2) and probably Forest City Comicon (Nov 5-6) as well!

{"id": "9138", "text": "There’s an old adage that theatre should inform, if not educate, and at last night’s Hidden Viewz’ production of Clingfilm, I learnt, at least, the difference between me and I, a simile and a metaphor, and the dangers of ketchup on stage – I must admit to being slightly concerned with the apostrophe after the letter Z?\nWritten and directed by Olugbeminiyi Bammodu, Clingfilm explores ‘the strain society put on our relationships and what adulthood really entails.’\nBammodu trained at East 15 Acting School, where he met actors Anna Thornley (Melissa), Matt Rolls (Daniel), Elliot O’Donnell (Jacob) and Oliva Caw (Rachel), all of whom make up the tight Clingfilm ensemble.\nThe plot synopsis explains that ‘Melissa and Daniel are university sweethearts. Years on, they are still living together, but their different lifestyles are now tearing them apart, held together by familiarity and a now fleeting love. Lawyer Melissa struggles to support her unemployed artist boyfriend Daniel in the pursuit of his passion.’ Integral to the story are Jacob, Daniel’s brother and Rachel, Melissa’s best friend.\nWhile The Water Rats is an attractive, comfortable black-box space, I felt that it was too small and hindered the overall production, but the clearly skilled ensemble carried on manfully, despite the slightly off-putting presence of all characters being on stage throughout the production.\nThat having been said, Anna Thornley as Melissa, the overpaid City lawyer-type, captured the destructive nature that money gives in relationships and was convincingly malevolent in her multiple nasty, bitchy swipes – of which there were many - at her poor, struggling artist partner. When asked why they were not married, her reply was, ‘he can’t afford the ring!’ What happened to love conquering all and the joys of a simple Hula Hoop?\nElliot O’Donnell as Jacob, Daniel’s brother was physically dominant, believable and showed real passion in his portrayal of frustration at his brother’s lack of direction and his reticence in getting involved in a family crisis. His wilful destruction of his brother’s painting with ketchup was a dramatic highpoint, sadly slightly lost by the errant tomato sauce hitting the front row of the audience!\nClingfilm as a piece has tremendous promise and potential and am sure that this will not be the last time we see it produced. Bammodu explores multiple themes in Clingfilm, some of which become repetitive and may benefit from some editing. The ensemble is clearly part of the wonderful new-generation of actors who must be applauded for the undoubted dedication to their craft. Equally the support and encouragement that companies such as HiddenViewz offer in the development and production of new work must be cheered at every opportunity.\nClingfilm is part of the Camden Fringe festival\nVenue: The Water Rats, Grays Inn Road\nDates: 30th July – 1st August 2018\nTime: 7.00 (pm) (90mins)\nTicket prices: £10/ concessions £7.50\nVenue box office: 07930399830\nFringe box office: www.camdenfringe.com", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

{"id": "9198", "text": "Unitek employee shines light on nurse recruitment in rural Nevada.\nNewport Beach, California – Unitek Learning is thrilled to announce that Dr. Victoria Rondez Squier, the Practical Nursing Program Director in Reno, Nevada, has been highlighted as a pioneering leader in the Nevada Nursing Association (NNA) Newsletter. Access to healthcare is one of the biggest challenges that rural communities face. With a deficit of more than 5,000 nurses in the state, Nevada rural communities are greatly impacted by the nation-wide nursing shortage. One of Dr. Squier’s primary goals is to break down barriers that are faced by educators and practitioners in these areas.\n“We are so proud of Dr. Squier’s work in rural nurse recruitment,” said Janis Paulson, Chief Executive Officer at Unitek Learning. “Through government-funded grants and incentives for career development, this call-to-action could help combat workforce shortage crises and better support communities across Nevada. We believe equity, inclusion, and innovation are vital when it comes to supporting the future of healthcare.”\nThe Nevada nursing community now has an additional partner to help retain more nurses. Joseph Filippi, Jr., the Workforce Program Manager with the Nevada Rural Hospital Partners, manages the Nurse Apprentice Program (NAP) Grant, which is funded by the U.S. Department of the Treasury American Rescue Plan ACT (ARPA). According to the NNA newsletter, a grant of $20,000,000 has been allotted to the NAP to attract nursing students in Nevada. These targeted regions include rural critical access hospitals and skilled nursing facilities.\n“Additional training around research and advocacy may be necessary to obtain new hires,” said Dr. Squier, Practical Nursing Program Director at Unitek College. “The NAP is a partnership opportunity that begins to address the unique needs of our nurses in remote communities. When I think about these nursing prospects, I am so excited for the future of healthcare and nurses in rural areas. It is truly an honor to represent Unitek and advocate our shared purpose, vision, and core values.”\nDr. Victoria Rondez Squier, DNP, MSN, RN, CNL, NE-BC, EBP-C, is a results-driven leader with more than 16 years of experience in acute care. Some of her areas of expertise include orthopedics, oncology, telemetry, pediatrics, telehealth, and leadership. Throughout her career, Dr. Squier has served as a nurse leader who is passionate about preparing future generations of nurses. In addition, she is the president elect of the Nevada Nurses Association (NNA) in District 1. Dr. Squier is now the Practical Nursing Program Director for Unitek College in Reno, Nevada.\nUnitek Learning is the parent company of several distinguished learning institutions: Unitek College, Unitek EMT, Eagle Gate College, Provo College, and Brookline College. Unitek programs teach the clinical practices and theory used in the field today. Equipped with a multitude of sought-after skills, Unitek graduates are prepared to excel in many of the fastest-growing careers in healthcare and nursing.", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}

{"id": "9285", "text": "When registering an Amazon account, we need to prepare account information, a residential IP, and a computer. Here is a set for use together, 1 device, 1 account, and 1 residential IP. Here I recommend YiLu Proxy\nwith 90M+ residential IPs from 200+ countries and regions. After preparing the required information, you can go to register an account. However, many sellers may have a question: which website should I register on? Or after I register, will all websites synchronize my account information? This is not the case. In fact, there is an obvious difference between the Amazon platform and eBay and AliExpress. Registering an account on the platforms of eBay and AliExpress can be synchronized to more than 200 countries and regions around the world. However, this is not the case with Amazon. Amazon's current operations are effectively separate website operations. For example, if I want to enter the US market, I need to register a US account. If I want to enter the European market, I need to register a European account. These accounts themselves are different, and different websites require different registrations. Now, if you want to register for the Amazon platform, you need to register for the US website. When you register for the US website, you will get accounts for the US, Canada, and Mexico websites at the same time.\nLet's talk about the European website. If you want to sell something in Europe, you can sell in five countries in Europe, the five countries are the UK, France, Germany, Italy, and Spain. You may ask, how do I sign up for these five websites? In fact, you can register for these five websites in any country. For example, if you register for the UK website, you can also sell to Spain, and you will also get accounts for these five websites. However, for most people, English is the most familiar language, so many sellers choose to register on the UK website. If you can speak other languages, such as Italian or Spanish, I suggest you consider registering on the Italian website or the Spanish website, because these websites have fewer registered accounts, so the review will be faster and the probability of passing is higher. In addition, if you heard that the Japanese website is good, in fact, on Amazon, the Japanese website is a good choice. Therefore, if you want to enter the Japanese market, you can also consider registering for the Japanese website. The Japan website is independently registered and operated independently.\nIn addition to the Japanese website, there is also a new website- the Australian website. At present, if you want to register an account on the Australian website, you need to wait for the Amazon investment manager to send an invitation link before you can register. As for whether the Australian website is worth paying attention to, I think that although there are fewer sellers, the sales may be better, but we must remember that it takes a process to cultivate the habits of consumers. In addition, Amazon's FB logistics system has just started to operate in Australia. If you choose to ship by yourself, your account may be adversely affected. Therefore, I do not recommend that you pay attention to the Australian website too early or too anxiously, and there is no need to put all your energy into this website.\nIf you want to operate the four websites in the United States, Europe, Japan, and Australia on Amazon, you need to register four times respectively. However, in the actual operation process, you can choose which websites to operate according to your own situation. For example, if you feel that you have the ability and energy to operate the US website now, you can focus on the US website first. If your Japanese is good and there are many Japanese resources that can be integrated, then you can consider operating a Japanese website. However, I don't recommend sellers register all websites at once and try their best to operate all websites. The risk of doing this is high, because if you have too many accounts, you don't have the energy to focus on every website and make every website run well.\nIn addition to this, there will be differences in the actual operation of each country. This difference is reflected in the operation, which requires the knowledge of the operation, the skills of the operation, and some relevant certifications of the products are different, which will also cause the risk of each website to be different. So I suggest that you can give priority to choosing 1-2 websites to operate, which is the best. This is about the difference between these websites when registering an account. From my own experience, I recommend that you give priority to US website.\nChoose to be a US website first. Some people may say that the US website is fiercely competitive, and that all websites are highly competitive, but relatively speaking, the US website is currently the largest among all websites, and its policy is relatively the lowest. The strictness of policy requirements is relatively low, and for us, the flexibility of operation will be relatively strong. In such a situation, we have a little more room to play.\nWhen you have made certain achievements in US website operations and made a good profit, you think I want to make further expansion. At this time, you will go to the European website and the Japanese website. It is logical to go to the Australian website and so on. But on the other hand, if you want to say that you want to go to the European website first, you will find that you are actually facing more things that you have to deal with in the early stage.\nOn the European website, the KYC (Know Your Customer) review will check whether your information is complete. If the information is incomplete, the KYC review may not pass. At this time, you need to register for a VAT tax number. If you do not have a VAT tax number, you need to pay taxes in accordance with the requirements of laws and regulations, otherwise, it may cause a series of risks. These requirements do not exist on the Amazon US website, but they do exist on other websites, including the Japanese website.\nFor Japanese website, you need to pay attention to the language issues. Then, Japan has different quality requirements for different products and requires different certifications for different products. Therefore, if your product does not meet the certification requirements in Japan, it may be at risk. It is recommended that you carefully choose an account that suits you according to your own situation.", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}
{"id": "9302", "text": "Start things off with your most recent submission to Cerebral Agony zine, your fiction piece Trick Or Treat. Was there any special inspiration for this piece, or was it influenced by any horror writers, well known or obscure, you consider personal favorites?\nI have been asked that question about every single story I've written. I'm sorry to say that I have no particular influences that inform my particular style of writing, though many have compared my short stories to the old TWILIGHT ZONE show on television back in the early 1960's. I suppose that would be the closest to any \"influence\" for my writing of short stories. I did watch the show and it always captured my imagination and I still remember many of the stories told on that show, and of course the old OUTER LIMITS.\nI was asked if I had any stories about Halloween to share. I didn't. Halloween is not of particular interest to me. You would think it would be. However, I was challenged to write something, so I remembered back to this old house at the end of our subdivision. Everyone talked about it being haunted and it did have that eerie look sitting there beyond the newer houses that all looked the same, standing in neat rows along the street, lit by a street lamp every five or six houses apart.\nI am now a Widow and I put myself into the story as the Old Widow Clayton. It seemed the proper thing to do, since she is the central figure in the story. I opened my mind and let the story tell itself. Odd as this may seem, all my stories write themselves. It seems as if I have no control over anything I write - they seem to transcribe themselves to me and I just type them into existence. The only inspiration I can give you for this particular story is that old house. It appears in a few of my writings.\nInfluences aside, are there any episodes of the old Twilight Zone and Outer Limits programs that still strongly resonate with you to this day? What qualities did those shows have that are not present in contemporary television?\nOn the TWILIGHT ZONE: it was an episode about a couple who stops into a town and enters a local diner [Nick Of Time -ed]. There, they begin to play with a fortune telling machine and they become almost prisoners to their own continuous questionings. On a show known as NIGHT GALLERY: The House, an episode about a woman looking for the perfect house and finds one; it is the one she has been seeing in her dreams but has always been afraid to enter. Then there is The Outer Limits and The Alfred Hitchcock Hour. All those shows were running when I was too young to see them and truly understand them, but I suppose I saw them in reruns. I don't remember to tell you the truth, but knowing I was born in 1956, it only goes to reason that I would not have seen the original broadcasts.\nI wrote a story about a woman who meets a very handsome man at a bus stop at night; it's for adults only; and this particular story is so reminiscent of those shows. I love those stories that leave you wondering; not too much or you'd just end up frustrated and wouldn't bother reading another and not too little or the author does the thinking for you and that is so anti-climactic, isn't it?\nThat is what I loved about those shows and those sorts of books and stories. I want to think. I want to imagine a bit of my own ending or my own explanation for the way a story ends. Television today has no end. And, the endings they do have are so clichéd and boring. I don't want to see it coming. I want that shock factor. I don't watch much television today and haven't for nearly two decades or more. It gives a person a lot of time to think. I can create my own entertainment right here in my own mind. And, sometimes, I share it.\nDid you always have an interest in old haunting tales, or was that old house you mentioned of particular interest to you?\nI have lived my entire life as a haunting in one form or another. I've always been a bit odd; different. As a child, I would imagine things and then knowing full well it was my imagining, but I'd still scare the hell out of me. That old house I spoke of at the end of our subdivision; that house is nothing compared to the one I dream about all the time. I know that house inside and out because I am always entering (as a lucid dreamer, I am always in control of the outcome should things get weirder than I thought it could be). I'm certain that I have either been in that house in a prior life or will be in this one. I am not afraid, but it is a bit eerie to say the least. That question always crosses my mind. Am I remembering or am I seeing the future? It may strike you as strange, but I have always known where I would end up years before I get there. I have a strong sense of premonition.\nIn what ways does the house you dream about differ from the house that serves as the setting for Trick Or Treat?\nBoth houses are very much alike, except one is much older and in disrepair. I wrote a really short story called THE AUTUMN VEIL and the ghost who resides inside the house (which at this point is in such ruin that it should be condemned) has walked its halls for decades. The house in all its incarnations is just the same house at different periods in time; perhaps I have seen it in the past, present and in the future and it remains with me. Or perhaps it was once the home of one of the other entities that now call this home their own.\nIt is no secret that I often write as if the story were dictated to me and I am only the transcriber, or the catalyst. It isn't unusual for me to get up in the middle of the night and start writing and wake the next morning with only a hint of remembering sitting at the computer and writing. I know I wrote it but I have no idea where it comes from.\nWithout revealing too much of the plot, can you reveal some information about the storyline of Trick Or Treat?\nThere is the usual group of friends and one is always being dared. That testing of his or her courage, or mettle, is important to them; they want to fit in and to be better than their taunters.\nThis little boy takes the dare. He knocks and the old woman asks him TRICK OR TREAT? Little does he know that the Old Widow Clayton will invite him in and what transpires from there is terrifying in the end.\nHe is sworn to silence as he goes out and sends the next boy to the door. Each boy must show their courage now that the weakest boy has proven his worth. Let's hope that when they are each asked the question Trick or Treat? that they answer correctly. It's the perfect Halloween story.\nIt has a twist you don't expect. All of my stories have endings that no one saw coming and that speaks volumes to me about my writing. I love it when the reader comments that they were totally surprised at the ending and it freaked them out. What an affirmation.\nIs there anything you wish to reveal about The Autumn Veil, while keeping the finale a surprise for the readers?\nAutumn Veil is a narration by the woman who inhabits the house, always did and always will. She is tempted to go outside but knows she must remain with the house. It is short but the story is descriptive of what she observes and hopefully the reader takes with them a sense of empathy for her and a feeling of what it must feel like to be tethered to something; being unable to break free.\nWhat inspired you to write The Autumn Veil, and where did the story’s feeling of being unable to escape come from?\nWhat if the house were a metaphor for our bodies? We cannot escape the inevitable: age. All the descriptions of everything she sees and hears are described metaphorically; it does give the story a new edge if you look at it this way. We are all just haunting the bodies we are given, or perhaps our bodies haunt our spirits?\nIt sounds as if surprise twist endings are an integral part of your fiction. How did you begin to develop this craft?\nAgain, it is something I was born with. I have done nothing to form it, mold it, or make it better. It just is. It takes a lot of patience living with me during writing. I become so deeply entranced in my story or verse that it is hard to wake me from the spell I'm under. Everyone understands that they are not to bother me if I am at the computer where I write.\nI kill a lot of people in verse and in storytelling. I have this uncanny ability to smell the blood, see it and taste it. I actually see more in the darkness than I do in the light and I can find so much more to write about and I can wallow in the textures and colors of the darker writes. I am not your “butterflies and daffodils” kind of poet and I do not write love stories.\nWhen a reader tells me they read something of mine and for the first time could actually feel like they were THERE in the story, that gives me so much satisfaction and I know I've done something incredible. I'm responsible for a few nightmares. I also give voice to those who are in mental pain and have no way to cry out. I empathize with their pain and write from their point of view. It is as if I can embody each character, regardless of whether they are fictional or real.\nI would have to admit that I am, in some part, in each of my characters. Every single story I tell, I am in it. I won't tell you who or what I am in that story or verse. I like to keep some doors neatly shut and locked.\nI've had a big audience with JUDITH; there are many who want a prequel to be written. But, I have to wait for those inter-dimensional beings to decide the timing of the write. I have no ability to write it without their involvement.\nLike so many other Mystic Writers, I feel it only fair to give credit to something \"other\" than myself for most of my writings. I am a catalyst much of the time and you can definitely tell when it is me writing or when it is being sent through me.\nDo I believe in ghosts? I live with them. Literally. They all want to be heard. It's only a matter of time. I've considered giving your magazine one story at a time from STORYTELLER (some will take up two or three separate zines). However, some are more tame than others and I'm not sure if you'd be interested in those - even though they have held up under the hardest audience to entertain - MEN. My male readers loved the stories in STORYTELLER and I was surprised at which they favored.\nPresent some examples in which you have written from another’s point of view? How much were you able to empathize with those whose point of view you wrote from, going by any feedback you received?\nI am part of a small group of writers. We challenge one another to write - someone picks a theme, another may add point of view, another may challenge form. The first time I wrote from a man's point of view was in a poem titled Le Voyeur. This poem is about the stalking nature of the male as he watches a woman he desires make her way around a room filled with other male admirers; each trying to win her. The male audience loved it. I suppose every man could relate to it in some way and it won me the respect and loyalty of many male readers. In addition, I have written over thirty poems from their point of view and several stories.\nOne is a story that takes place inside an old bar late at night. A man who is new to the neighborhood sits down for a drink and notices an old man sitting in the corner mumbling something about black cats. There is only one woman sitting at the bar and she seems uninterested so this man decides to go over and share a drink and possibly hear the story as to why this old man is talking about black cats. The story he tells is an amazing one. Certainly has a twist. All of the conversations taking place in the bar are between men. In another, two young boys set out to find their missing grandfather.\nA poem that really stood out among my readers feedback was \"Trophy Heart\". It was a few days before Valentine's Day and the challenge was this: A gift in a heart shaped box. The lengths a man will go to in order to share his love with her. That was all. I shudder to think of all the men who shared this poem with their ladies... if the feedback said anything, it told me that all my male readers could definitely relate. That in itself should give every woman pause.\nShe lies on the bed so stilI.\nI push back the hair from her face\nAs I place her hands together,\nWatching, as her fingers interlace.\nHer breathing is soft and shallow.\nA tear traces the hollows of her skin.\nReflections of dreams on the blade\nBid me now - the end shall begin.\nUpon her neck I place the steel,\nHer pale flesh bares no resistance;\nBeauty in the eyes of the beholder\nTorn from the eyes of existence.\nMy hand shakes with anticipation,\nThe mind echoing sweet goodbyes.\nJust one last drag off my cigarette\nBefore I cut the last of our ties.\nA Kiss on the lips that fade to white,\nRelease not even the slightest moan\nAs the knife plunges deep inside;\nHer heart beating there … alone.\nMy hand enters inside the wound\nTo caress her vessel of mortality.\nI lean down to kiss this treasure,\nLaughing at this insane formality.\nGently I lift her still beating heart\nFrom her cold and sunken chest,\nTo feel its power in my hand\nThe prize for my lofty quest.\nTo separate her heart from soul\nAnd drink from this garnet chalice,\nI celebrate with intoxicating joy;\nNo fear, no regrets, no malice.\nPlaced within the velvet box,\nThis the object of my affection,\nTo keep close to my own heart;\nTo heal my soul's affliction.\nA souvenir from the one I love\nForever encased in this shrine -\nNo longer struggling to conquer\nThe heart that is finally mine.\nDiscuss how long you have been writing poems and a few of the verses that best represent where you are coming from.\nI have been writing poetry since - about the third grade; even then, I was obsessed with death. It never frightened me or gave me any reason to fear. I was just so curious about it.\nI looked into the mirror and saw a reflection\nthat called to mind a bit of introspection. I asked,\nwhere was she now after all these years and\nwhy I now feel all her fears and hiding behind a veil of tears\ndenying all the breakdowns and this... dereliction.\nShe looked back from the glass with those hollow eyes\nand spoke to me from cracked lips, then to my surprise, she answered\nall the question asked to her; the sensible, the absurd, and\nstill there hanging on every word were the answers I never heard;\ndenying all the truths and remaining here as my reality dies.\nWho is this woman whose eyes are yellowed and overcast?\nDid she come here to haunt me from my past? I'm afraid\nthat this is who I will become before I finally know, and\nsay goodbye and let her go, before I ever said hello... how apropos\nthat as I finally recognize the woman... her image is fading fast.\nThe mirror was empty, there was nothing reflecting back\nat me though I was still searching for something lacked. I wondered\nif life was worth all the pain we experience in our own end, and\nif all the time we so carelessly spend buys us nothing... we just pretend\nand paint imaginary colors on a reality that always... always... fades to black.\nHow do the poems you sampled above reflect your feelings toward mortality, or could possibly be autobiographical?\nI believe in previous lives and future lives that intersect with this one. Science is catching up. Some of what I write is autobiographical, but mostly the Mystic Verses. I do not believe in sin. I do not believe in death. I do not believe in heaven or hell. I do not believe in the need to redeem ourselves to a greater creator. I believe we are divine... all of us. The Esoteric and Hermetic teachings would explain many of the parables and discussion the Christ had with his inner circle. The Gnostics understood.\n“She is the mystic one; you will know when you find her.”\nThough I vaguely understood what I heard,\nThe riddle hung on that one subtle word… Mystic.\n“She will appear to you pale; she glows a ghostly white.”\nThis vision imagined could not compare\nWith the porcelain skin of the Lady fair… Mythic.\n“She will lift her eyes as if she searches for you here.”\nThe color changes - blue, green, black as coal;\nI swear her gaze pierced me and looked into my soul… Orphic\n“She will know you without seeing, using purest sight.”\nShe entered into me, a dark labyrinth\nSpinning a golden light; she the fairy Absinthe… Gnomic\n“She will offer you her hand, there is nothing to fear.”\nFrozen in time in this ethereal place\nYou try to look away but cannot forget her face… Panic\n“She will tell you that you can stay or take your leave and flight.”\nChoice matters not if she begins her dance,\nYour feet will not obey; never given that chance… Tantric\n“She is your dream within your dream; your delight.\n“She is the creation, by your fantasies and your own hand,\nShe controls everything yet nothing, nothing at all…,\nShe summons you to her while she listens for your call…,\nShe is the Mystic One and she only obeys your command.” … Mystic.\nThinking about all that is and all that has been\nAll things seen and all things unseen\nAll things real, all things dreamt and what hides in between\nSearching my memories for images of our blessed Queen.\nBlinding the unworthy eyes that glimpse her beauty\nForever mocking them with the final things they see\nBurned into the hallowed halls of within our memory\nThe labyrinth of lies of what was and what could be\nSearched the Woodland Isle, the land of Emerald Green\nFrom the caverns of finest tourmaline\nTo tallest mountain, across meadows, to deepest ravine\nOut into the depths of the azure; into the vast marine\nSeeking the one who resides inside the mystery\nHidden behind the veil of the fabled Fairy Tree\nI shall find her, holiest of holy, the goddess She\nI will sever the spell that binds her, I will set her free\nBehind the mist, the twilight mossy screen\nLed to the threshold of betwixt and between\nWhere the Powers, the Seers and Thrones convene\nI finally found the remnants there; my beloved Queen\nShe, no longer the image of grace and beauty\nYet I remembered my purpose, remembered my duty\nAnd gathered her remnants and held them closely\nChanting the incantation that would bring her to me\nFéadfaidh an FAE dúisigh ár banríon uasal\nPóg a súile awake agus go réidh a croidhe bogadh\nan anáil na farraige, dul isteach di, a thabhairt ar an saol\nBí linn anseo ag siúl mar aon ní amháin agus riamh a bheith ar leith\nKnowing about all that is and all that has been\nAll things seen and all things unseen\nAll things real, all things dreamt and what hides in the between\nI am both her guardian and vessel – Hail to the Queen.\nI'm not sure these would be autobiographical - but they are the closest that I could summon, at this time, to represent me.\nWHERE DOES THE DARKNESS GO?\nWhere does darkness go when we light the match?\nRetreating like a frightened flock of ravens to the sky\nClouds of black smoke upon the distant horizon\nFrom the ring of fire reflected in my eye\nWhere does the darkness go when the candle burns?\nShadows cowering in the corners of uncertainty\nConfused by the flame as it flickers to and fro -\nBalanced upon the truth so delicately\nWhere does the darkness go when the fire rages?\nBlind souls feeling their way through a shallow cave\nThe gates of hell have opened up to swallow them\nTheir bonfires consume them before the grave\nWhere does darkness go when the sun fills the sky?\nShining a light on the transgressions of men,\nNo longer hidden beneath the cloak of deception\nPassing judgment on those who have sinned\nWhere does darkness go when the moon is full?\nShades of those who walk alone in the night\nTrying to escape their ruin and damnation\nAnd the condemnation revealed in the light\nI search for the darkness, my salvation\nA shelter from the omnipotent flame\nCover me in obscurity and delusion\nForever separated from the truth and the blame\nWho were the poets you read when younger and ended up influencing or inspiring your approach to writing poems?\nPoe. He was the poet to perfection and a storyteller in verse. That is why he is still held in such high esteem today.\nI must give credit to my Third Grade teacher Mrs. Bowling, the woman was crazy (smart); she had us memorize these ten or more stanza poems and recite them for her. Poems like THE HIGHWAYMAN by Alfred Noyes and COLUMBUS by Joaquin Miller. Also, credit to my Seventh Grade teacher, Mrs. Baker; she introduced me to Yevgeny Yevtushenko., We would listen to him recite his own works via a vinyl album played in the classroom. Amazing to listen to.\nI also love Bukowski. But the ultimate influence to my writing in High School was Poe.\nThere are quite a few people who have contributed to the zine who are readers of Poe. Which of his poems most resonated with you?\nThe Conqueror Worm. In death, we are all the same; our physical bodies rot and become nourishment for those creepy crawly things beneath the ground while our souls wrap themselves around each other and permeate and penetrate and become one, then two, then one again. Why do we fear death? Death does not exist. We are like water; solid like ice, liquid like the flowing rivers; ethereal as mist, as fog, as phantoms in the night which can only be seen against the darkness yet we breathe it in; this vapor... we inhale it and it courses through our blood and exits through our own perspiration. We are all things, and yes, in the end, once we have breathed our last and our blood coagulates within our veins, we are nothing more than food for those conqueror worms.\nWhat is the plotline of Judith and how much of a response has it received since it was published? Can this fiction be found in print or online?\nJUDITH made my house payments for over a year. It was a booming success for me personally and professionally. It is published by Lulu Press and can be found at Lulu.com in hard cover, soft, and e-book. The e-book is free to download and will be until the first of next year. It is my gift to those who could not afford a book and do not have a Nook or Kindle to read from. You can find this book on Amazon and Barnes & Noble, as well as other smaller venues. The Burton women have passed down what is now an antique bedroom suite which includes a vanity with mirror. The mirror shows the signs of age among other things. The old antique vanity and mirror was handed down from generation to generation, from mother to daughter, along with the legacy of its madness; the heavy burden carried by all the Burton women, the haunting image within the glass, the reflection of innocence lost when the mind fractures beneath the weight of HER judgment… We see what we want to see in the mirror but when the mirror looks back at us, what does it see?\nWhat sort of reviews or feedback has Judith been given online or in print? Do reviewers appreciate the ideas you put across in this novel?\n“A novella that quickly catches your attention & carries you into the depths of your own reflection within that looking-glass. She is macabre, haunting, & brilliantly adept at making her stories your own. You’ll never look at a mirror the same way – hell, you’ll never look 'into' a mirror the same way! M Teresa Clayton is a writer to watch & remember.” -William S. Avery.\n“M. Teresa Clayton is the consummate author of the macabre, but with the writing of 'Judith'; she has managed to outdo even herself. This book grabs you by the throat within the first two pages, and leads your brain on a bloody trail- with shards of shock throughout the story. This author is simply uncompromising, and unsurpassed when it comes to giving us the Horror that we love.” -Debbie Dixon.\n“Mirror, Mirror on the wall… M Teresa Clayton puts a new spin on that old rhyme with her novella JUDITH. You may find yourself covering all the mirrors in your house!” Keep reading.” -W Avery.\n“Shall I spoil the secret? Condense the story into an easily digestible … and thus easily dismissed … single bite? I think not. You’ll just have to put forth a little effort and read the story for yourself, probably more than once. That said, M. Teresa’s Clayton’s “Judith” is descriptive yet chronologically disjointed storytelling perfectly sets the tone for this tale. I read it with a growing sense of unease and each time I convinced myself that I knew where the story led I was pleased to learn that I was mistaken, perfect for this genre. This is horror, no doubt; not all of it stems from supernatural sources. This is a ride worth taking.” - Quicksilver Night Prod.\nThese are a few of the reviews I've received - however, most of the comments are made on the Facebook page and I'm unable to collect them all and give them to you here. I believe that the sales of the book, along with the ratings in the top 10 and top 20 at Lulu.com speak volumes. The book is still selling and I'm still receiving checks.\nIs Storyteller a collection of fictional pieces written by you? How long has this publication been available for ordering?\nAll stories in this book are authored by me. These stories are a bit more tame, with the exception of THE WEDDING BED, which is slightly risqué. You can find this book in the same venues, online, as JUDITH. Each story is unlike any of the others in the book; there is a variety. Nine short stories to entertain you and each one with a twist and hopefully leaves you wondering about possibilities. I've been approached by Indie filmmakers about putting a couple of those on film. I do not write screenplays. I have offered to allow someone else to do that and take credit. So far, nothing has come from any of those inquiries. THE SHORE, WEDDING BED and STORYTELLER were the three that seemed to pique the interest of those filmmakers. Again, you will find me in each of these stories, as well as in the novella JUDITH. My readers are now enjoying a healthy discussion about who represents me or what characteristic or event represents me. I give no hints and I have yet to confirm anyone's guess. Hitchcock of me, I know. And, it is fun to see what others take from the story as well as the author!\nWhat about The Shore, Wedding Bed and Storyteller interested filmmakers in bringing them to the screen? Were these local filmmakers or well-established indie filmmakers?\nSome local and some not. All interested parties are Indie, I don't know if any of those, should they take on the project proposed, would make it to the BIG screen. The Shore and Storyteller would be the easiest to put to film; Wedding Bed is a period piece. But, if the screenwriter wanted to make it with a current time frame, that would be fine.\nWhat have your casual readers been getting out of your fiction of late? How important are their thoughts to you?\nI do not write for the reader; I write for myself. It is wonderful that the readers love the work. I have never written or published with the hopes of being well known, but if that happened it might be okay. I just don't want to have to write for the corporation, the sales. I don't want someone changing the story I WROTE, for the money as their goal. This is why I will not sign a contract with a big publishing house. I know two authors who have signed and they regret their choice.\nHow did you feel about being approached by indie filmmakers interested in your fiction? If you had the resources, would you ever want to see this idea come to fruition?\nI was extremely honored. I have no interest in getting involved with a film-makers vision of the story. I will give my blessing and wait impatiently for the final cut. It would be interesting to see their take on the story.\nI have another story about a young Scotsman who is dying on the battlefield when two women descend from the clouds. I need a man and two women who can speak with that Scottish accent to do a recording of that story, and I will direct. There isn't much to it really. The title comes to me and the names of those two female characters came AFTER the story was written. I made the changes because, as it turns out, there really is a myth regarding this sort of thing. Who knew? The Veil Of Forgetfulness: beautiful and vivid. It would cost me nothing; I would be collaborating with a sound engineer, the three narrators and everyone would get to see their names on the project. That's how I like to do things: work together and make something wonderful and everyone benefits... including the listener/reader/viewer.\nAre there any directors in particular whose work you admire? Present some examples of their work.\nHitchcock for sure. The Birds, North By Northwest, etc. And whoever directed THE HAUNTING, the old black and white version of Shirley Jackson's terrifying book. She is the only writer who scared the hell out of me.\nHow faithful is the film version of The Haunting to the novel penned by Shirley Jackson (The Haunting Of Hill House)? There were two versions of that movie, the version you’re referring to was released in 1963 and directed and produced by Robert Wise (the other was released in 1999 and directed by Jan de Bont).\nOh, the much older version for sure. Your imagination does all the work. In the 1999 version they give you too much animation and manufactured effects. The film in 1963 was absolutely true to the book. Amazingly so. Some things were left out - but it did not poison the transfer from page to screen. Of course, books are always better; you are the director and it's your vision you see... but this movie did a fine job of scaring me and that doesn't happen often. It still gives me pause.\nDo movies today give you the same impressions you got from The Haunting? What direction has horror cinema taken of late, and what would you suggest should be done to make horror movies horrifying?\nI believe that we are spoon fed our feelings, our emotions, our understanding, our opinions. We don't think any more. We shoot people in video games and that desensitizes us to violence; we search for something to give us that rush and now young people shoot real people. They have brought the video game to life. The same goes for our television and movies. Nothing is left to the imagination any longer. The television shows are not filtered for the young minds and then we wonder why our girls are acting as they are and our sons are acting out in their way. Our movies are just moving pictures, bigger and brighter but actually dumbed down so much that it makes people like me ashamed to be a part of that genre at all. Yet, reading is losing its hold, music is even becoming manufactured; where is the art? Where is the human factor, the talent? How does the viewer of art interact with something that does not need them to think?\nThe trend in music, television and movies has been heading in this direction for some time. Artists like Jim Morrison had far more respect for their fans than most “entertainers” seem to these days. We all know mainstream media continues this trend to gain from the public’s tendency to believe whatever they’re told. Some would argue that this is the world and we should quietly let things continue the way they are, others would say that reality is what we make it. What is your position?\nI do believe we create our own reality. The mind/soul can reach out to vast areas and bring back information and uses thought to communicate it to the brain. That is simplifying but I'd rather not expand on it. I have a great deal of respect for my audience. They inspire my writes. Many of them were THE inspiration for a particular piece. I'm not that depressed, but I can certainly put myself in their shoes and write from a perspective I have had experience with. That said, I do not write FOR my audience. They are \"love notes\" to myself from myself. I do it for me. It is my passion. It is my creative expression. I am very fortunate that so many like the work and follow it. I am very fortunate to be keenly aware of their presence in my reality; they are a part of it because I have called it to me and I have opened up my process to them. I could also become very closed off and unattainable, but, I prefer to stay human in all of its incarnations. I believe that all arts; written, visual, audio; are gift and we have a responsibility to affect change for the better. You and I are one and the same; what affects you is affecting me. Those Others I mentioned, they are part of intradimensional beings that inform me daily in my actions, thoughts and writings. They are always with me. They are watchers and they want the best for all of us.\nWhat do you most admire about Shirley Jackson’s approach to writing? Are there other novels you have read by her?\nThis is the only book of hers that I have read and I have read it many times. Her style of writing is so descriptive that it puts you in the story; you can sense it with all of your senses, the haunting is happening to you, the reader, and it still continues long after the last page.\nAre there other authors past or present whose work you particularly admire?\nI see lyricists as poets; if I were to say I admire anyone's work, it would be the likes of a Morrison, a Justin Hayward, a Bob Dylan, CSNY, etc. The blending of music with words just gives it more depth. But, admire is not a word I use much. “I am responsible for my successes and for my failures\"; no one else. You will see that this quote is not mine but will be in the biography of Gabriela Garza Padilla that I just finished writing and will make its debut in 2015. She and I agree on just about everything philosophical and anything empirically scientific.\nOther fiction pieces you have submitted to the zine include the short pieces Time And Sensuality and Conversation On Jerry Spranger. Explain the storylines of those two and where the inspiration came from.\nJerry Spranger was a parody and I was just nauseated by the whole genre. The people are an embarrassment to themselves and anyone they are associated with. The whole genre just pisses me off. I hate that ignorance. So I wrote that as a sarcastic response to what that whole thing is about. It wasn't my best for sure. I have no idea why it ended up published in your zine, but I'm honored. Perhaps you saw something in the story that was worthy.\nTime And Sensuality is erotic. She is masturbating and quickly moves from beginning to end at the stroke of twelve. Each clang of the clock announces each movement as she reaches her climax. Short and sweet.\nAnother one that is not my best, but found worthy of print. I love the cadence, the rhyme scheme and the story of this poem; however, it wasn't met with very much enthusiasm, so I assume it wasn't that interesting to the public as a whole.\nTHE LONG GOOD-BYE\nWhere does the time go?\nThe moments, not so long ago\nWhen I could feel your gentle sigh\nWhilst seconds flash and quickly die\nSoon lost in moment’s afterglow\nAre taken with your gentle sigh\nWhere does the time go?\nWe barely said our first hello\nWhen I could asked the question, why?\nWhilst youth was still the sweetest lie\nA truth I chose to never know\nBuried ‘neath that question, why?\nWhere does the time go?\nThe hours seem to ebb and flow\nLife is good whilst tide is high\nBefore we thirst; left parched and dry\nCaught in memory’s undertow\nPulled under when the tide is high\nWhere does the time go?\nBlown adrift, the winds of woe\nDarkened corners as day turns nigh\nI’ve lost my love, gone by and by\nYears rush on as the days move slow\nAnd the rhythm of my breath draws nigh\nWhere does the time go?\nWishing never made it so\nNever had the chance to say good-bye\nNor pause to hear my cool reply\nTis’ true we reap the crop we sow\nLaid barren now, the whispered long good-bye.\nInspiration comes from everywhere, everyone, everything. I am a watcher, a listener, a sentient being. I sometimes speak for those who have no voice. I sometimes try to correct the wrongs or offer condolence. I try to purge the hurt that empathically absorbed. I give a voice to the darkness, the sensual, those subjects we think about but don't speak of. I write about who I was in previous lives, future lives and who I am today (metaphorically). If you are alive you should be aware of everything. If you are not, you are simply existing. I am alive and I am blessed with the time and freedom, as well as the knowledge, of being able to expand my consciousness to many realms, many layers, many possibilities.\nWith more music being manufactured, and dumbed down television programming becoming more popular, and genuine entertainment becoming fewer and farther between, how can people like you and I and others who care about what we do and want the public to think instead of insulting their intelligence reach more people with our work?\nKeep it pure. Let people know it is being kept pure. Ask people to give it a try. Sooner or later, we all come full circle. I am seeing the sales of books in the hand beginning to come back. People are not that happy with the Nook or Kindle; this was a phase, something new and high-tech. People are beginning to be less impressed with things high-tech and coming back to using their own minds. It may take a while.\nHow long do you think it will take before more people go back to reading books instead of reading on the internet?\nSales of the hold in your hand books are already seeing a resurgence. The e-book is all the rage as well. Nook and Kindle are losing ground. Soon, ebooks will too. It's hard on the eyes to read from a computer generated screen and not at all as convenient as some thought. The actual book - flipping through the pages and smelling the print on paper - that is something you cannot manufacture via technology. Also, one cannot buy a book and have it signed by the author - which is something I get a lot. Same with Cd's - people want the CD and they want it signed. It is personal. We have the ability to print out a copy of someone's art or photography and frame it and hang it in our homes. But how many people do this? No. We want the real thing, or a certified copy that is signed and comes with a validation. The book is not dead. Neither is the magazine. It waxes and it wanes as does everything else in the cosmos. Just wait for it and be prepared for the onslaught of fans knocking at your door.\nAre you considering releasing an anthology of your poems and fiction? Would you release it in print or online or both?\nI had two books out: ...And The Snow Falls (a sampler) and Mystic Verses. Both have been pulled and are being revised as we speak. I just finished the Biography of Gabriela Garza Padilla: Transcendence in Art. It will be debuting in 2015 to a huge gala of her art collectors and I will be the celebrated guest at that event in Monterrey Mexico. Keep your ears and eyes open! Another book of short stories is ready to publish and I am working on possibilities of a prequel to JUDITH for my readers.I have another novella in the works as well. A book about black cats - see STORYTELLER.\nHow would you most like to be remembered as a writer when people look back on your career?\nShe wrote with conviction. She wrote without compromise. She covered a host of emotions and experiences and no one can put her into any one category or box. She was unique, a bit eccentric, and entertained us with our own stories.\nM Teresa.Clayton on Facebook", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

{"id": "9384", "text": "Ugly ducklings: should rubber ducks be banned from the bath?\nScientific curiosity knows no bounds: a group of Swiss and US researchers have delved into \"the dark side\" of inviting rubber ducks and other flexible plastic toys into our tubs.\nAny plastic materials dunked in bathwater provide ideal conditions for bacterial and fungal growth, according to the conclusions of the joint study, published Tuesday by the Swiss government.\n\"Dense growths of bacteria and fungi are found on the inner surface of these flexible toys, and a murky liquid will often be released when they are squeezed by a child,\" the Swiss government statement said.\nThe researchers from the Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology EAWAG, the Swiss Federal Polytechnic School and the University of Illinois found that \"diverse microbial growth is promoted not only by the plastic materials but by bath users themselves.\"\nFor their study, they carried out experiments with real bath toys and controls using new bath toys under conditions simulating household use.\nOver a period of 11 weeks, they exposed some of the toys to clean and others to dirty bath water, containing things like soap and body fluids.\nWhen they cut open the toys, \"the findings sound unappetising: between five million and 75 million cells per square centimetre were observed on the inner surfaces,\" according to the summary of the report.\nThe researchers stressed though that there was a big difference between the plastic toys exposed to different types of water.\n\"Fungal species were detected in almost 60 percent of the real bath toys and in all the dirty-water control toys,\" the statement said.\n\"Potentially pathogenic bacteria were identified in 80 percent of all the toys studied, including Legionella and Pseudomonas aeruginosa,\" which is often the culprit in hospital-acquired infections, it added.\nThe main problem is that warm water gathers inside the toy, often made of low-quality polymers, which release organic carbon compounds that serve as nutrients to growing bacteria colonies.\n\"During bathing, other key nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus, as well as additional bacteria, are contributed by the human body (body fluids such as urine and sweat), external contaminants and personal care products,\" according to the study.\nThis allows bacteria and fungi to multiply inside of a toy children often enjoy using to squirt water into their faces.\n\"This could strengthen the immune system, which would be positive, but it can also result in eye, ear, or even gastrointestinal infections,\" microbiologist Frederik Hammes pointed out in Tuesday's statement.\nSo should we toss the ducks out with the bathwater? Or as some suggest on Internet comment forums, simply plug their holes to avoid the accumulation in their cavity?\nHammes suggests a more scientific approach: tighter regulations on the polymeric materials used to produce bath toys.\nMore information: Lisa Neu et al.

{"id": "9393", "text": "The Pitch: Finnish post-metal/sludge band Mireplaner deliver a deeply atmospheric, powerful debut album. FFO: LLNN, The Lion's Daughter, Cult Of Luna\nWhat I Like: Mireplaner are a band very much willing to take their time. The ambience of opening track, \"Deadweights,\" lingers like an ominous, rising smoke over its nearly 6 minute duration. And as they say, where there's smoke there's fire. I get annoyed with seemingly obligatory intros, but with A Mountain of Saola Hooves, every moment is purposeful. All of that buildup makes the explosion that is \"The Elkhorn Coral\" all the more impactful. And to quote the Log Lady, \"When this kind of fire starts, it is very hard to put out.\" At varying levels of heat intensity, this blaze of sludgy guitars and howling vocals consumes everything in its path, dying down to post-metal embers just long enough on \"Morass\" to lull the listener into a false sense of security. The longest track on the album; it's also arguably the most dynamic and engaging. From the perfectly punctuated transitions to the deliciously groovy closing riff, Mireplaner are no mere novices when it comes to songwriting. Furthermore, the production on this album is every bit as massive as their major label peers, yet with only a tiny fraction of the support.\nCritiques: I've got virtually nothing negative to say about this album. It's not necessarily doing anything new for the genre, but as is a common phrase in my reviews, they're doing it better than most.\nThe Verdict: If you loved The Lion's Daughter's first album or just in general enjoy well-paced, powerful sludge, you should absolutely pick up A Mountain of Saola Hooves. Mireplaner are every bit as talented as the heavy-hitters in the genre and deserve the same level of attention. Buy it now on their Bandcamp. It's out and streaming full today.\nFlight's Fav's: The Elkhorn Coral, Morass, Knees Cicatrised\n- Review by FlightOfIcarus\nSUBSCRIBE to our Trench Talk Podcast on iTunes, Castbox, YouTube, and BitChute.

{"id": "9420", "text": "You’ve Never Seen a Liquid Eyeliner Like Urban Decay’s 24/7 Inks — Review\nWhile most of my liquid eyeliner collection consists of, more or less, standard black cylinders that are about five inches long, the 24/7 Inks stand out immediately for their gunmetal-purple tubes that are just over seven inches long with the cap on. Below the applicator, the tube flares out in three different places, giving fingers a natural resting place during application (more on that in a second), then tapers into a slim tip, like a paintbrush.\nThe eyeliner’s nine-shade range includes bright green, yellow, and blue, and neutrals such as gray, brown, and white, all in matte and metallic finishes. It’s a far cry from the 24/7 Glide-On Eyeliner Pencil’s 38-shade range, but Urban Decay’s general manager Malena Higuera says the colors were chosen carefully, curated from makeup trends and beloved shades the brand already has in existence. “We translated some of our fan-favorite 24/7 pencil shades into a vegan liquid format,” she says, citing Freak, Gunmetal, and Zero.\nThey say Rome wasn’t built in a day, and neither was this eyeliner; according to Urban Decay’s product research and development (R&D) team, the entire creation process took two years. That might sound like a long time, but it’s not when you consider that these liquid eyeliners are like snowflakes: Each unique shade has a different formula and applicator based on its specific color and how best to make it flow.\nAs the R&D team explains, some pigment particles of colors are bigger than others, and bigger particles — often found in pastels and shimmers — are more difficult to make flow through a pen format. If you’re wondering why some shades in this range have a brush tip and others have a felt tip, it’s all to accommodate what works best for each particular shade.\nThe story behind that funky-looking handle\nWhen I said the tube tapers like a paintbrush, I meant it: The Urban Decay team found its inspiration for the 24/7 Inks Liners packaging, including the grip, in arts and crafts supply stores. Says Higuera, “Our product development team looked for the easiest-to-use paintbrushes and found that the ones with ergonomic grips that show you exactly where to hold it were the most intuitive, especially for doing fine lines.”\nThe raison d’être for this product is to make punchy, graphic eyeliner trends approachable for everyone. One team member used to lead makeup-artistry classes, where they learned that a lot of makeup wearers just aren’t sure where and how to hold a liquid eyeliner pen to get a seamless application. Urban Decay found the solution in those paintbrushes and modeled its own version accordingly. The brand developed and tested about 10 iterations before landing on The One.", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

From baking delicious edibles to crafting creative gifts, the Ultimate Guide to Planning a Weed Christmas offers plenty of ideas for a festive and mind-altering holiday season.\nWhether you’re looking for a way to add a bit of extra flavor to your Christmas dinner or just want to get creative with some new cannabis-themed decorations, this guide has you covered.\nSo, grab your rolling papers and get ready for an unforgettable end to the year!\nIf you’re making edible cannabis treats for your Christmas gathering, the first step is to familiarize yourself with the potency of your plants. This will inform your recipe and allow you to make adjustments as necessary, leading to a more consistent end product.\nNext, you’ll want to create a cannabis-infused butter. This is the most common, straightforward recipe, and can be used in a variety of ways. Depending on the strength of your butter, it can be spread on toast, added to popcorn, or used to make cannabis-infused baked goods.\nStart by decarboxylating the cannabis, which removes its natural oils and activates its THC. Then, add the decarboxylated cannabis to a pot with some butter.\nSimmer for up to two hours, strain the plant material, and use the infused butter in place of regular butter in your favorite baked goods.\nYou can make as many weed christmas recipes as you like!\nTips for Pairing Cannabis with Food\nThere is no definitive guide to pairing cannabis with food. While some people may prefer to pair their cannabis with chocolate or fruit, others may prefer cheese or a hearty meal.\nHowever, there are a few things to keep in mind when pairing cannabis with food:\nCannabis has a pungent aroma that easily transfers to your hands. If you are eating food with your hands, make sure to wash them with soap and water before you smoke or vape.\nYou’ll want to wait a bit before eating after smoking or vaping. This can depend on the person, but generally the rule of thumb is about an hour.\nCannabis can cause you to feel full more quickly than usual. If you are pairing a substantial meal with cannabis, make sure to pace yourself and leave some room for dessert!\nWith the legalization of cannabis in many parts of the world, it can be easier than ever to include cannabis in your holiday decorations. Create a cannabis-themed Christmas tree by using string lights to create a Christmas tree.\nSimply use a clipper to clip the lights and wind them around a tree. You can also make Christmas wreaths out of cannabis plants by simply wrapping a wreath frame with string and clipping your plants to it.\nA cannabis Christmas tree is the perfect conversation starter for your holiday party, and a cannabis Christmas wreath is a great gift for your friends and family this holiday season.\nWeed Christmas Gifts\nWhat better way to celebrate than with a gift that’s both functional and fun? Cannabis-themed gifts are a great way to show your family and friends that you’re thinking of them this holiday season.\nMassage oils: Massages are great for relaxing and reducing stress, and cannabis-infused massage oils are a great gift for your loved ones.\nCannabis-infused lotions: Cannabis-infused lotions are great for moisturizing your skin and relaxing your muscles. They are perfect gifts for loved ones that are looking for a way to unwind.\nBath salts: Cannabis-infused bath salts are a great gift for your loved ones. They are easy to make and can be added to any type of bathwater.\nCannabis-infused chewing gum: Cannabis-infused chewing gum is a great gift for friends and family. It’s easy to make and a great way to medicate discreetly.\nCannabis-infused tea: Cannabis-infused tea is a great gift for family and friends, especially if you live in a place where edibles are not as accessible.\nHosting a Weed Christmas Party\nMany people choose to host a cannabis-themed Christmas party. Simply invite your friends over and let them know that cannabis will be present.\nYou can keep the festivities simple with a few snacks and drinks and a game of cannabis-themed Christmas Trivia.\nIf you want to go all out with your Christmas cannabis party, you can try one of these fun activities:\nMake cannabis-infused cocktails or mocktails. This is a great way to get creative and add a festive flair to your party. You can make cannabis-infused cocktails with cannabis oil or butter.\nMake cannabis-infused holiday cookies.

Keep these tips in mind to make your party weed-friendly.\nAsk guests to arrive and depart on time. This is important because in many places, cannabis has a short onset period, especially edibles. If you have guests arriving at all different times, it may be difficult to manage who is under the influence and who is not.\nMake sure there are snacks at all times. You don’t want your guests to get hungry and then be unable to eat because the food is in the oven.\nCreate a comfortable space. You’ll want to make sure that the temperature, sound level, and lighting is comfortable for all guests.\nThis Christmas, why not add a little cannabis to your festivities? From edibles to decor, this guide has everything you need to make your Christmas cannabis-friendly!\nFun ways to consume cannabis at your holiday party to cannabis-themed gifts for your friends and family, this guide has plenty of ideas for a festive and mind-altering holiday season.\nAs well as decorating the tree to baking delicious edibles, there is no better way to celebrate weed Christmas than with a little cannabis!", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

Soleimani’s killing marks a major escalation in tensions between Washington and Tehran.\nUnder his leadership, Iran had bolstered Hezbollah in Lebanon and other pro-Iranian militant groups, expanded its military presence in Iraq and Syria and orchestrated Syria’s offensive against rebel groups in the country’s long civil war.\nIran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said “severe revenge awaits the criminals” behind the attack. He also announced three days of national mourning.\nSoleimani was widely seen as the second most powerful figure in Iran, behind the Ayatollah Khamenei. The Quds Force, an elite unit of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards, reported directly to the ayatollah and Soleimani was hailed as a heroic national figure.\nThe US has called the commander and the Quds Force terrorists and holds them responsible for the deaths of hundreds of US personnel.\nPresident Trump, who was in Florida at the time of the strike, tweeted an image of the American flag shortly after the news broke.\nTweeting again on Friday, Mr Trump said Soleimani had “killed or badly wounded thousands of Americans… and was plotting to kill many more” and “should have been taken out many years ago”.\n“While Iran will never be able to properly admit it, Soleimani was both hated and feared within the country,” he said.\nA statement from the Pentagon – the headquarters of the US Department of Defense – said Soleimani had been “developing plans to attack American diplomats and service members in Iraq and throughout the region”.\n“This strike was aimed at deterring future Iranian attack plans,” it added. Soleimani and officials from Iran-backed militias were leaving Baghdad airport in two cars when they were hit by a US drone strike near a cargo area.\nThe commander had reportedly flown in from Lebanon or Syria.

It also incurred €618.9m in additional costs, after forgoing business rates relief.\nIn Central Europe, operating profit dropped to £124m, which Tesco said was a result of the Covid-19 trading restrictions and Hungarian retail sales tax.\nTesco’s full year pre-tax profit fell from €1.1bn to €952.7m.\nRichard Hyman, a partner at the retail consultancy TPC, said that trading through Covid-19 had been costly for Tesco.\nHyman said: “In order to trade through the pandemic, Tesco has had to spend a lot of money looking after the health of both their customers and their staff and that’s been very costly.”\nTesco said its strong sales growth was boosted by a 77% rise in online sales. Like-for-like sales rose by 6.3% for the group.\nThe supermarket said that while some of the additional sales volumes would fall away as Covid-19 restrictions eased, it expected a strong recovery in profitability as most of the costs incurred during the pandemic would not be repeated.\nIt said because of a “greater than usual level of uncertainty around sales volumes, mix and channel shift” it was difficult to predict operating profit for its retail business. However, Tesco said it expected it to recover to a similar level in the previous financial year.\nKen Murphy, Tesco’s chief executive, said: “Tesco has shown incredible strength and agility throughout the pandemic. By putting our customers and colleagues first we have built a stronger business. I’d like to say a huge thank you to the entire team for rising so selflessly to every challenge they’ve faced. Their efforts have been truly heroic.\n“While the pandemic is not yet over, we’re well-placed to build on the momentum in our business.

{"id": "9475", "text": "Ellendale is a southwest St. Louis neighborhood located north of I-44, west of Hampton, east of the city limits and south of Manchester. I was able to get out on the Yamaha 125cc scooter for my photo tour of Ellendale. Scooter is the best means of transit in doing these tours through the neighborhoods because you can turn on a dime, go up on sidewalks to take pictures, and of course talk to the locals. People naturally want to talk to you when you’re on a scooter and the kind people of Ellendale were no exception.\nSo who calls Ellendale home? The neighborhood continues to lose population, but could be considered relatively stable, with moderate loses. The 2010 Census counted 1,575 residents, a 5% decrease over a decade. The 2000 census counted 1,656 residents (9% decrease from 1990’s count) of whom 85% were white, 10% black, 1% Asian and 3% Hispanic/Latino. 756 housing units were counted of which 91% were occupied, 69% by owners, 31% by renters. As the numbers above suggest, this is not a largely residential neighborhood. And per the map, you can see that most of this area is devoted to rail yards.\nA gentleman in Maplewood helped me locate the city/county divide. Just look for the streets to change, he said. He’s right, there is a distinct difference in the city/county streets.\nCounty to the left, city to the right. Goddamn, even our streets are cooler than the county’s…just kidding, just kidding. I recently got some coaching from some dear old friends to not be so harsh on our neighbors to the west. Said Maplewoodian went on to tell me it is even easier to notice the county line in the winter because Maplewood clears the streets of snow/ice and St. Louis does not (they always think they’re better than us…oops coaching…stop it Mark).\nAlong Manchester, the city has marked it’s turf just west of McCausland:\nAnother kind resident ask me what I was doing with the camera, and directed me to this little clubhouse (NO BOYZ ALLOWED!). She said it’s one of her favorite sights in the neighborhood. I’m thinking Little Rascals or Goonies or Sandlot…way to go girls!\nThe aforementioned rail yards:\nRail yards beget packaging operations, light industry and trucking. Ellendale has examples of all:\nThe building above used to be part of the Polar Wave Ice & Fuel Co. network, the largest ice manufacturer and distributor when ice was needed for home use before modern refrigeration. This company took advantage of St. Louis’ clean water supply to rise to one of the largest ice companies in the country. This tradition of clean water still exists as we are among the top cities in the U.S. for clean and plentiful water. One of Polar Wave’s buildings along Gravois is on the historic registry and has been tastefully restored; we’ll get to that on the Benton Park post.\nThere are 2 very large ambulance operations within Ellendale, the EMT and Abbott companies.\nThere are also several car lots in Ellendale along Manchester, my favorite being the Brother-Hood lot:\nEllendale is also affected by the presence of I-44, dividing it from Clifton Heights and Lindenwood Park:\nAnd of course the River Des Peres that snakes it’s way through Ellendale:\nFlow mighty river, flow gently to the sea.\nA little history and background on Ellendale from the city website:\nMuch of what is now the Ellendale neighborhood was part of the property belonging to James C. Sutton who died in 1877.\nMr. Sutton’s land was divided among his nine children. One daughter, Mary C. Marshall, sold her share, in 1890, to a St. Louis real estate company. The real estate company platted a subdivision named Maplewood and planted maple trees along its streets. Other plantings resulted in such street names as Elm, Myrtle, Hazel and Flora.\nMaplewood was an inner suburb of St. Louis and electric streetcars which began running westward from St. Louis on Manchester Avenue in 1896 improved transportation. The pleasant suburban atmosphere attracted many new residents to Maplewood, including upper middle class and professional families.\nKate Thomas, another of James Sutton’s daughters, started Ellendale. A large gas explosion prior to the 1904 World’s Fair either demolished or damaged some of the older homes in the area which had been built in the late 1800’s. However, several stately homes, originally built for executives of the Scullin Steel Company, after the 1904 World’s Fair, are still standing on present day Ellendale Avenue and Ellendale Place. It’s said that these homes were built with materials left over from the Scullin Steel exhibit at the Fair.\nCharles Sutton, another son, sold his land south of the railroad to Moses Greenwood. Greenwood developed a subdivision named for himself, but with street names that included Piccadilly, Commonwealth, Tremont, Oxford, and Cambridge, which today are included in the Ellendale neighborhood.\nMcCausland Avenue was named for James McCausland who opened a tract west of Glades in 1859.\nOne of the topographic features in the Ellendale neighborhood is the valley of the River des Peres–once a river, now a drainage works–which emerges from its underground course through Forest Park near Macklind avenue just south of Manchester avenue, and flows again on the surface in a southwesterly direction before swinging south along the city limits. A public park at the corner of Arsenal street and McCausland avenue contains ball diamonds and lighted tennis courts.\nWilkinson school–a magnet school at 7212 Arsenal Street–was built in 1927. Surrounded as we are by Maplewood and the Southwest neighborhood, many activities spill over into these areas.\nAs in most of the city’s outlying areas, commercial and industrial uses cluster around principal transit intersections such as Southwest. Industrial activity in the area began in the 1850’s with the construction of the Pacific railroad. Excellent clay deposits brought the establishment of several firebrick works to this area of the city. Coal was also discovered in the area in the late 1850’s. One establishment of long-standing, the Scullin Steel Company, ended production in the late 1970’s. The property was sold to a developer who built the St. Louis Marketplace on the site at Manchester and Abbott.\nPerhaps because we are a small neighborhood on the outskirts of the city, not much history is available. Our present day crime rate, however, is reported to be the lowest in the city. The percentage of home ownership is high. The major arteries, I-44, Highway 40, and I-55 are easily accessible and downtown is just minutes away. Public transportation is easily accessible. Maplewood and the St. Louis Marketplace provide plentiful shopping opportunities.\nExcerpts are taken from “St. Louis–It’s Neighborhoods and Neighbors, Landmarks and Milestones”. Compiled and edited by Robert E. Hannon. Courtesy of the Missouri Historical Society.\nIt’s interesting that Ellendale claims the lowest crime rate in the city and so does Boulevard Heights on their website.\nI am very interested in the gas explosion of 1904. I can’t find any information through a google search. If anyone has any leads on this, please email me.\nHere’s some more info regarding the Scullin Steel Company. The business was founded in 1899 by John Scullin and went out of business in 1981.\nJohn Scullin was the Chairman of the Board of Scullin Steel Company. After starting his business career selling stoves, he went to work in the railroad business as a brakeman before establishing himself as a railroad contractor. His largest project was the construction of the Missouri, Kansas, and Texas Railroad in 1870. He came to St. Louis in 1875 and constructed several streetcar lines there. He later worked as a financier and founded the steel company. He was buried in Calvary Cemetery in north St. Louis.\nAmong other things, Scullin provided steel for the burgeoning railroad industry, expanded it’s plant to accommodate the defense contracts of WWII and eventually provided some of the steel for the construction of the Gateway Arch.\nThe worker’s entry gates were a fixture along Manchester until the site was remediated to become the dreadful St. Louis Marketplace: largely vacant, suburban styled strip mall.\nIn many ways Ellendale epitomizes the typical story of American cities. Once privately owned land in the 19th century, passed down to the next generation who sold it for development to meet the growing population base and industrial power of the U.S. The area was mined for it’s coal and it’s clay, it was then part of the steel boom to meet the demands of the railroad age through WWII and beyond; it employed lots of people for 80 years.\nA neighborhood of humble homes were built to house the workers in the mills. Then came the late 1970’s and 1980’s when the demise of the American steel industry was in full play. Foreign competition among other things sunk the industry. The late 20th century then gave way to the thought that modern big box retail and light service industries would save the cities. Not so much, take a look at Marketplace today which sits on the former site of Scullin Steel. It’s an eyesore and possibly one of the biggest suburban experiments to FAIL in the city’s long history (St. Louis Centre is a close second in my opinion):\nAre you proud of that? Looks like shit to me. And this thing was ushered in by the city with TIFs in hand. Here’s a telling descriptor found within this strip mall, and quite possibly a new name for the “Marketplace”:\nFrom the St. Louis Business Journal:\nThe city backed the bonds for Midland Group’s $53 million St. Louis Marketplace in the 6500 block of Manchester Road in 1991. When the retail center did not meet revenue projections, the city was on the hook for $3 million and now estimates it will have to pay an additional $1.3 million over the next two years, until 2011 when the TIF expires.\nWhen the Midland Group sought to develop St. Louis Marketplace in the early 1990s, it could not get financing because of the perceived risk at the site, a former steel mill. Stephen Notestine, former principal of the Midland Group and now managing partner of Chesterfield-based Quadrant Properties, said the city’s backing of the bonds for a $15 million TIF for St. Louis Marketplace was necessary to move the project forward. The land required extensive environmental remediation and Union Pacific railroad lines that ran through the site had to be relocated.\nRetailers that initially flocked to the half-million-square-foot St. Louis Marketplace in the 1990s, including a Sam’s Club and Builders Square, ultimately vacated the strip center, leaving it mostly empty before the center was re-positioned as office space under new ownership in 2005. But the city is still on the hook. Under the deal, the city did not have a PILOT (payment in lieu of taxes) agreement, and no standing to foreclose on the property before it was re-positioned. Its debt is still locked into a 7.5 percent interest rate with no ability to re-finance.\nAgain, another setback to Ellendale was a huge gas explosion in 1904 that destroyed many of the homes built in the 1800’s. I couldn’t find any info on this explosion; but I can’t help but wonder if maybe the explosion took out most of the brick structures, because there aren’t that many of the brick/stone homes that characterize most of the other St. Louis neighborhoods. However, this is also what kind of sets Ellendale apart in a positive light. It’s got a ton of frame homes all shapes and sizes:\nBut no St. Louis neighborhood is completely devoid of at least a couple brick or stone structures:\nThere are also several newer suburban styled homes right off of McCausland:\nThe neighborhood meetings are held at the intriguing Piccadilly at Manhattan restaurant which dates back to the 1920s:\nI will surely be back to check this place out. I should also note that this is the first neighborhood that I couldn’t find a church. It’s quite possible that I simply missed one, if you know Ellendale better than I, let me know if a church exists within the boundaries of the hood.\nThe Wilkinson School now an early childhood development facility within the SLPS for pre-K to 2nd graders:\nA hot ride for hot times:\nStreet legal? Check. Distinctive? Check. Coveted by yours truly? Check. In fact, I coveted this in 1976 and I still do today. In defense (or not) of the city, this hot shit was actually found in Maplewood…look at the street beneath those bad ass wheels…that’s a fancy county street.\nEllendale is not a tony neighborhood, not a particularly well branded hood, and it’s got well under 2,000 residents. It may not be a destination place, but the history is rich and the feel is good. And if you are a fan of frame homes, this place is a treasure trove.\nThis guide was originally published at St. Louis City Talk in March 2010.\n***In July, 2020 I revisited the neighborhood and the following includes updated commentary and photos.***\nMisses On Original Tour\nI am pretty happy with it, but Nick’s Pub is not actually in Ellendale per the refined city boundary map. There is now a popular diner in the neighborhood which I don’t think was there in 2010 when I did my first post.\nI missed the fact that are many amazing Dutch Colonial homes.\nSo many of the sided homes are straight up beauties. And it’s not just standard vinyl siding, there are lots of variations in materials and colors to make it quite interesting and varied.\nAlso, if you are the type that likes a driveway, garage, larger yard and no tuck-pointing bills but still want to live in St. Louis, this is one of the spots you should look.\nI also missed the gorgeous Maplewood Bible Church, which I’m almost certain is actually in St. Louis, just east of Limit Avenue (city limit border).\nAlso, back in 2010 I had not yet visited the Piccadilly at Manhattan restaurant. Now, I know it dates these posts to mention specific businesses, as they tend to come and go, but man what a great spot. It is a total neighborhood place, it’s one of those places you go and it is totally a vibe of the people that live there. Some of the best freaking fried chicken and chicken pot pies in the entire city. A true St. Louis original. Check it out.\nThere is some new construction showing the high demand to live in this part of the city.\nThe place is highly stable, with lots of home care and it’s improved in the last ten years. Seems like a new generation has moved here and is taking sustainable landscaping and home upkeep seriously.\nThe Great Rivers Greenway bike trail expansion is a massive benefit for the neighbors who like to walk and ride bikes. Links to that project are included below. It is totally connected to the Metrolink light rail Shrewsbury stop.\nWhat Are The Future Needs?\nHmmm, I don’t know, it’s pretty dense and perfect the way it is. I guess I’d say build on the empty lots. Sadly, I read of a developer trying to build a 100+ unit apartment building in the Ellendale Neighborhood Association meeting minutes that the proposal has run into snags; not sure why, but I’d say build it out! It’s a great place to live.\nI’d also say the former Melvin Wilkinson school, a 1928 R.M. Milligan beauty, that closed in 2008 is ripe for development. The SLPS sold this one to a developer who was going to turn it into affordable housing for teachers. Not sure if that fell through, last I read, it was under contract (2018 source). There are not signs of work and the windows are open to the elements. This would be a great place to live. After I originally posted this, someone from the neighborhood reached out to me and indicated a developer has purchased the property with plans of residential conversion.

{"id": "9478", "text": "Stomach tacking, also known as gastropexy, is a surgical procedure that involves securing the stomach to the abdominal wall in order to prevent it from twisting, a condition known as gastric dilation volvulus (GDV) or bloat. This life-threatening condition occurs when the stomach fills with gas and then twists on its axis, cutting off blood flow to the organs and causing severe pain and potential organ damage. Stomach tacking is often recommended for large and giant breed dogs who are at a higher risk for developing GDV due to their deep chests and narrow waists.\nDuring the procedure, the veterinarian will make an incision in the abdomen and suture the stomach to the abdominal wall, preventing it from twisting. This surgery can often be done preventively during a spay or neuter surgery, or it can be performed as a stand-alone procedure.\nStomach tacking is an important preventative measure for dogs at risk of developing GDV. While it is not guaranteed to completely eliminate the risk of GDV, studies have shown that it can significantly reduce the likelihood of the stomach twisting, potentially saving a dog’s life.\n– Monitor your dog’s food and water intake, and avoid vigorous exercise immediately before or after meals.\n– Consult with your veterinarian about the possibility of stomach tacking for your at-risk dog.\n– Be aware of the signs and symptoms of GDV, including restlessness, pacing, drooling, and an enlarged abdomen, and seek immediate veterinary attention if you suspect GDV.\nNirogitan (Nirogi Tan) means a healthy body.

{"id": "9526", "text": "Chiaroscuro is a technique that uses contrasts between light and dark to create an effect of depth in a painting. It is often used to create the illusion of volume in a two-dimensional medium such as a painting.\nThis technique works well with paintings that depict scenes with figures or objects that are placed on different planes. This technique can also be used to create dramatic effects by emphasizing certain aspects of the scene. Such as bright areas around a subject’s eyes or mouth which would otherwise be blocked by shadows if they were not highlighted by light.\nChiaroscuro has been used by many artists over the years, including Caravaggio who was known for his use of this technique to create strong contrasts between light and dark areas within his paintings.\nThe technique is commonly used in oil painting, but can also be used in watercolor and acrylic. It is a very useful tool for creating the illusion of depth within a painting by emphasizing the contrast between light and dark areas.\nThe effect can be achieved using many different brush strokes. But the most common method involves using large areas of flat color with minimal detail to create the highlights and shadows.\nHow can chiaroscuro be used in art?\nChiaroscuro is a style of art that uses strong contrasts between light and dark. The effect is often used to create the illusion of depth and volume.\nChiaroscuro can be used in several ways:\n1. To give an object or scene more drama, by emphasizing its shadows\n2. To create a sense of three-dimensionality, by creating a sense of depth through the contrast between light and dark areas\n3. To highlight certain objects in a scene, by highlighting or minimizing them based on their relative brightness or darkness\nSo, the effect of using chiaroscuro is to create a sense of realism and depth in a painting. It also allows the viewer to see details in the shadows and highlights of an image. Moreover, this technique can be used to create a dramatic effect, which makes it useful for portraits and other types of paintings where you want to draw attention to certain parts of the image. As an artist, you can use this technique to make your work stand out from all others, by making it look realistic or interesting.\nJessica Olson is a talented painter known for her evocative and vibrant artwork. Her paintings eloquently capture the beauty of the natural world and the depth of human emotion. With a keen eye for color and form, Jessica’s art invites viewers to embark on a visual journey that resonates with the soul.

The section of pipe that ruptured, which was about 28 feet long and weighed about 3,000 pounds, was found 100 feet south of the crater. PG&E estimated that 47.6 million standard cubic feet of natural gas was released. The released natural gas ignited, resulting in a fire that destroyed 38 homes and damaged 70. Eight people were killed, many were injured, and many more were evacuated from the area.\nThe National Transportation Safety Board’s investigation found that the rupture of Line 132 was caused by a fracture that originated in the partially welded longitudinal seam of one of six short pipe sections, which are known in the industry as “pups.” The fabrication of five of the pups in 1956 would not have met generally accepted industry quality control and welding standards then in effect, indicating that those standards were either overlooked or ignored. The weld defect in the failed pup would have been visible when it was installed. The investigation also determined that a sewer line installation in 2008 near the rupture did not damage the defective pipe.\nThe rupture occurred at 6:11 p.m.; almost immediately, the escaping gas from the ruptured pipe ignited and created an inferno. The first 911 call was received within seconds. Officers from the San Bruno Police Department arrived on scene about 6:12 p.m. Firefighters at the San Bruno Fire Department heard and saw the explosion from their station, which was about 300 yards from the rupture site. Firefighters were on scene about 6:13 p.m. More than 900 emergency responders from the city of San Bruno and surrounding jurisdictions executed a coordinated emergency response, which included defensive operations, search and evacuation, and medical operations. Once the flow of natural gas was interrupted, firefighting operations continued for 2 days. Hence, the emergency response by the city of San Bruno was prompt and appropriate.\nHowever, PG&E took 95 minutes to stop the flow of gas and to isolate the rupture site—a response time that was excessively long and contributed to the extent and severity of property damage and increased the life-threatening risks to the residents and emergency responders. The National Transportation Safety Board found that PG&E lacks a detailed and comprehensive procedure for responding to large-scale emergencies such as a transmission pipeline break, including a defined command structure that clearly assigns a single point of leadership and allocates specific duties to supervisory control and data acquisition staff and other involved employees. PG&E’s supervisory control and data acquisition system limitations caused delays in pinpointing the location of the break. The use of either automatic shutoff valves or remote control valves would have reduced the amount of time taken to stop the flow of gas.\nPG&E’s pipeline integrity management program, which should have ensured the safety of the system, was deficient and ineffective because it—\n• Was based on incomplete and inaccurate pipeline information.\n• Did not consider the design and materials contribution to the risk of a pipeline failure.\n• Failed to consider the presence of previously identified welded seam cracks as part of its risk assessment.\n• Resulted in the selection of an examination method that could not detect welded seam defects.\n• Led to internal assessments of the program that were superficial and resulted in no improvements.\nSeveral deficiencies revealed by the National Transportation Safety Board investigation, such as PG&E’s poor quality control during the pipe installation and inadequate emergency response, were factors in the 2008 explosion of a PG&E gas pipeline in Rancho Cordova, California. (See Explosion, Release, and Ignition of Natural Gas, Rancho Cordova, California, December 24, 2008, Pipeline Accident Brief NTSB/PAB-10/01 [Washington, DC: National Transportation Safety Board, 2010].) This 2008 accident involved the inappropriate installation of a pipe that was not intended for operational use and did not meet applicable pipe specifications. PG&E’s response to that event was inadequate; PG&E initially dispatched an unqualified person to the emergency, causing an unnecessary delay in dispatching a properly trained and equipped technician. Some of these deficiencies were also factors in the 1981 PG&E gas pipeline leak in San Francisco, which involved inaccurate record-keeping, the dispatch of first responders who were not trained or equipped to close valves, and unacceptable delays in shutting down the pipeline. (See Pacific Gas & Electric Company Natural Gas Pipeline Puncture, San Francisco, California, August 25, 1981, Pipeline Accident Report NTSB/PAR-82/01 [Washington, DC: National Transportation Safety Board, 1982].) The National Transportation Safety Board concluded that PG&E’s multiple, recurring deficiencies are evidence of a systemic problem.\nThe investigation also determined that the California Public Utilities Commission, the pipeline safety regulator within the state of California, failed to detect the inadequacies in PG&E’s integrity management program and that the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration integrity management inspection protocols need improvement. Because the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration has not incorporated the use of effective and meaningful metrics as part of its guidance for performance-based management pipeline safety programs, its oversight of state public utility commissions regulating gas transmission and hazardous liquid pipelines could be improved. Without effective and meaningful metrics in performance-based pipeline safety management programs, neither PG&E nor the California Public Utilities Commission was able to effectively evaluate or assess PG&E’s pipeline system.", "scores": {"score": 4, "score_transform_1": 5, "score_transform_2": 5, "score_transform_3": 0}}

{"id": "9640", "text": "Milk snakes and coral snakes are two species of snakes that are often confused with each other. While they share some similarities in their physical appearance, there are several key differences between them that can help you identify which is which. Knowing how to tell the difference between a milk snake and a coral snake can be important for your safety, as coral snakes are venomous while milk snakes are not.\nIdentifying milk snakes and coral snakes can be tricky, as they both have bands of red, black, and yellow or white. However, there are a few key differences to look out for. Coral snakes have red bands that touch yellow bands, while milk snakes have red bands that touch black bands. Additionally, coral snakes have a black head and a short tail, while milk snakes have a more elongated head and a longer tail. If you are unsure which type of snake you are dealing with, it is best to err on the side of caution and assume it is a coral snake.\nWhen it comes to habitat and geographic range, milk snakes and coral snakes have different preferences. Milk snakes are found throughout North America, from Canada to Mexico, and can be found in a variety of habitats including forests, fields, and deserts. Coral snakes, on the other hand, are found primarily in the southern United States, and prefer wooded areas and swamps. They are also protected by law in many states, so it is important to know the legal guidelines for handling them.\n- Milk snakes and coral snakes can be difficult to tell apart, but coral snakes are venomous while milk snakes are not.\n- Coral snakes have red bands that touch yellow bands, while milk snakes have red bands that touch black bands.\n- Milk snakes are found throughout North America, while coral snakes are primarily found in the southern United States and are protected by law in many states.\nIdentifying Milk Snakes and Coral Snakes\nMilk snakes and coral snakes are often confused due to their similar color patterns. However, there are key differences that can help you distinguish one from the other.\nOne of the most noticeable differences between milk snakes and coral snakes is their color patterns. Coral snakes have red, yellow, and black bands that are arranged in a specific pattern. In contrast, milk snakes have a similar banding pattern, but with different color arrangements. Milk snakes can have red, black, and white bands, or brown and tan bands.\nTo remember the difference between the two, you can use the rhyme “red on yellow, kill a fellow; red on black, friend of Jack.” This means that if the red bands touch the yellow bands, it is a coral snake and venomous. If the red bands touch the black bands, it is a milk snake and non-venomous.\nAnother way to tell the difference between milk snakes and coral snakes is by their head shape. Coral snakes have a small, rounded head that is barely wider than their neck. In contrast, milk snakes have a wider, triangular head that is wider than their neck.\nFinally, milk snakes and coral snakes have different pupil shapes. Milk snakes have round pupils, while coral snakes have slit pupils like a cat.\nBy paying attention to these key differences in color pattern, head shape, and pupil shape, you can confidently identify whether a snake is a milk snake or a coral snake.\nHabitat and Geographic Range\nMilk snakes and coral snakes have different habitats and geographic ranges. Understanding the differences between these two species can help you identify them in the wild.\nMilk Snake Habitats\nMilk snakes are found throughout North America, from Canada to Mexico. They prefer to live in forested regions or areas of open woodland. Milk snakes can also be found in swamps, prairies, farmland, rocky slopes, some semi-arid/chaparral areas, and sand dunes/beaches. They are adaptable and can survive in a variety of habitats.\nCoral Snake Habitats\nCoral snakes are found in the southeastern United States, from North Carolina to Louisiana, and throughout Central and South America. They prefer to live in wooded areas, along the edges of swamps, and in sandy or marshy areas. Coral snakes can also be found in gardens and around houses. They are not as adaptable as milk snakes and are more limited in their habitat preferences.\nIn summary, milk snakes are found throughout North America and are adaptable to a variety of habitats, while coral snakes are found in the southeastern United States and Central and South America and have more limited habitat preferences.\nMilk Snake Behavior\nMilk snakes are generally docile and friendly snakes. They are not aggressive towards humans and are more likely to flee than to confront a perceived threat. When threatened, milk snakes will often try to hide or burrow in the ground. They are also known for their climbing ability and can often be found in trees or on fences.\nMilk snakes are active during the day, but they are also active at night. They are opportunistic feeders and will eat a variety of prey, including rodents, birds, and other reptiles. Milk snakes are not venomous and are harmless to humans.\nCoral Snake Behavior\nCoral snakes are known for their dangerous venom and aggressive behavior when threatened. They are highly venomous and should be avoided at all costs. Coral snakes are often protected by law, and it is important to know the legal guidelines for handling them.\nCoral snakes are also active during the day, but they are more active at night. They are secretive and often hide in burrows or under debris. When threatened, coral snakes will often stand their ground and may even strike without warning. They are also known for their distinctive coloration, which serves as a warning to potential predators.\nIn summary, milk snakes are docile and harmless to humans, while coral snakes are highly venomous and should be avoided. Milk snakes are active during the day and are opportunistic feeders, while coral snakes are secretive and often hide in burrows or under debris.\nMilk Snake Venom\nMilk snakes are non-venomous and are not harmful to humans. They are known to be docile and are often kept as pets. Milk snakes have small, rear-facing teeth that are used to grip and swallow their prey.\nCoral Snake Venom\nCoral snakes are venomous and have one of the most potent venoms of any North American snake. The venom of the coral snake is neurotoxic and can cause respiratory failure, paralysis, and death. Coral snakes have small fangs that are located in the back of their mouths. They must chew on their prey to inject venom.\nIt is important to note that while coral snakes are venomous, they are generally not aggressive and will only bite if they feel threatened. If someone is bitten by a coral snake, it is important to seek medical attention immediately.\nAccording to Petkeen, the venom of the coral snake is not always fatal, but it can be dangerous to humans. The effects of the venom can vary depending on the amount injected, the location of the bite, and the size and health of the person bitten. Symptoms of a coral snake bite can include pain, swelling, numbness, and difficulty breathing.\nIn summary, milk snakes are non-venomous and pose no threat to humans, while coral snakes are venomous and have a potent neurotoxic venom that can be dangerous if not treated promptly.\nSafety and First Aid\nPreventing Snake Bites\nPrevention is key when it comes to snake bites. Here are a few tips to help reduce the risk of getting bitten by a snake:\n- Wear protective clothing such as boots, long pants, and gloves when in areas where snakes are present.\n- Avoid walking through tall grass or areas with dense vegetation.\n- Use a flashlight when walking in areas with low visibility.\n- Be cautious when handling objects such as rocks or logs, as snakes may be hiding underneath.\n- Keep your distance from snakes and do not attempt to handle or provoke them.\nFirst Aid for Snake Bites\nIn the event of a snake bite, it is crucial to seek medical attention immediately. Here are a few first aid tips to keep in mind:\n- Keep the affected limb immobilized and at or below heart level.\n- Remove any tight clothing or jewelry near the bite site.\n- Clean the bite wound with soap and water.\n- Do not attempt to suck out the venom or apply a tourniquet.\n- Do not apply ice or heat to the bite wound.\n- Do not give the victim any medications or alcohol.\nRemember, the most effective treatment for a snake bite is anti-venom administered by a medical professional. It is important to get to a hospital as soon as possible to receive proper treatment.\nMilk snakes and coral snakes are both important members of their ecosystems. However, their conservation status is different due to their distinct characteristics and habitats.\nMilk Snake Conservation\nMilk snakes are not considered endangered or threatened. According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), the milk snake is classified as a species of “Least Concern” due to its wide distribution throughout North America and adaptability to various habitats. However, habitat loss and fragmentation could pose a threat to their populations in the future. It is important to protect and preserve their habitats to ensure their survival.\nCoral Snake Conservation\nCoral snakes are a different story. They are considered threatened or endangered in some states in the United States. According to the IUCN, the eastern coral snake is classified as a species of “Least Concern”, but the western coral snake is classified as a species of “Near Threatened”. Habitat loss, human encroachment, and the illegal pet trade are the main threats to their populations. Coral snakes are also often mistaken for other non-venomous snakes, which can lead to their unnecessary killing. It is important to educate the public about the importance of coral snakes and their role in the ecosystem.\nIn conclusion, while milk snakes are not currently facing significant conservation threats, coral snakes require more attention and protection to ensure their survival.\nFrequently Asked Questions\nHow can you differentiate between a milk snake and a coral snake?\nMilk snakes and coral snakes can be easily differentiated by their color bands. Coral snakes have red, yellow, and black bands that are in the order of red, yellow, and black. Milk snakes, on the other hand, have bands that are in the order of black, red, and yellow. A common mnemonic to remember this is “Red on black, friend of Jack; red on yellow, kill a fellow.”\nWhat are the venom toxicity levels of a coral snake compared to a milk snake?\nCoral snakes have highly potent venom that can cause serious harm to humans. Their venom contains neurotoxins that can lead to respiratory failure. Milk snakes, on the other hand, are non-venomous and pose no threat to humans.\nWhich snake is more aggressive: a milk snake or a coral snake?\nNeither milk snakes nor coral snakes are known to be aggressive towards humans. They are both shy and will try to avoid confrontation when possible.\nHow does the mimicry behavior of milk snakes benefit them in the wild?\nMilk snakes have evolved mimicry behavior that allows them to resemble venomous coral snakes. This mimicry protects them from predators that would otherwise prey on them. By resembling a venomous snake, milk snakes are less likely to be attacked, giving them a better chance of survival in the wild.\nIn an encounter between a milk snake and a coral snake, which is likely to prevail?\nIn an encounter between a milk snake and a coral snake, the coral snake is more likely to prevail. Coral snakes have highly potent venom that can cause serious harm to other snakes, including milk snakes.\nCan a bite from a milk snake be harmful to humans?\nMilk snakes are non-venomous and their bite is not harmful to humans. However, it is important to note that any bite from a snake can lead to infection and should be treated immediately.", "scores": {"score": 4, "score_transform_1": 5, "score_transform_2": 5, "score_transform_3": 0}}

Now, SF Bicycle Coalition member Christopher enjoys bicycling in San Francisco and beyond. Read on to learn why he signed up for our class and where he rides now.\nSF Bicycle Coalition: Why did you decide to take Adult Learn to Ride?\nChristopher: Due to growing up in a dangerous neighborhood and coming from a poorer family, I never learned to ride a bike. I always felt embarrassed and left out as an adult when friends wanted to do bike-related activities. As a new-ish San Francisco transplant, I wanted to take advantage of living a life that allowed for more outdoor social activities, and was also influenced by the “you can do it” mentality this city offers. In a season of overcoming my fears, I decided I wanted to learn to ride. I wanted to have a skill that is useful in many areas of life and that opens doors not only to social circles but to everyday life tasks.\nI specifically looked for an adult learner’s course when it came to learning how to ride a bike. The idea of learning as an adult was scary enough, and having to do it in a class aimed for kids was not helpful to my self-esteem or ability to learn.\nHave your biking habits changed since taking the class?\nBefore taking the Adult Learn to Ride class through the San Francisco Bicycle Coalition, I was both terrified and embarrassed to get on a bike. I did not know how to ride – end of story. Since taking the class, and several of the Practice Rides (with Juli) I have felt confident enough to ride solo and with friends. I have been on rides at Sunday Streets, with out-of-town friends, when I travel to other cities, and I even participated in Bike to Worship week with my church (Mission Bay Community Church) last spring. I don’t own a bike, so I don’t get out as often as I would like. Still, it’s so easy to rent a bike here that when the opportunity to ride appears, I take it.\nAnything else you’d like to share?\nI would like to say that I am so incredibly appreciative of the instructors of the course who treated us all with dignity and respect, understanding our fears, and giving us insightful (and calm) instruction. Most of my fellow classmates passed the course that very day, and I firmly believe it was due to the positive environment that the San Francisco Bicycle Coalition created for us.\nWant to help others like Christopher experience the joys of riding a bike?

It is the second post in our series “#Syriasly” that presents the Syrian conflict from a variety of perspectives. Check our our first post in this series here.\nThree years ago, I would jump out of my chair in excitement when I heard the word “Syria” in the news. When I would come across the word in a textbook or book, I would re-read the lines over and over again in awe at the fact that my country was actually mentioned. Pathetic, I know, but Syria was always fairly calm compared to its surrounding regions. Now, you can’t come across a single media outlet without seeing or hearing the word Syria mentioned at least once or twice. If only it was mentioned in a positive light. But here I am two and half years later, contemplating what the next event for Syria should be. This is a normal day in the life of Syrian-American activist.\nI am originally from Hama, Syria but I was born and raised in Phoenix, Arizona, which is where I currently reside. I attend Arizona State University, yes, the number one party school in the nation. But my college experience has been anything but a party. At the start of my sophomore year, my friend and I founded a student organization called Save Our Syrian Freedom (SOS Freedom). As vice president of this organization, the majority of my time spent outside of school has been centered around Syria. My experience this past year through my work has been stressful at times, but nevertheless, successful.\nAs an organization we have two goals: to spread awareness to the general public and to raise money for the victims of this crisis. Our two goals go hand in hand; as people become more aware of the severity of the crisis, they will be more inclined to donate. To raise awareness, we hold walks, flash freeze mobs, and peaceful protests. We simultaneously hand out flyers that direct people to various websites where they can donate to the victims. Even though the conflict has been ongoing for two years, some people still have no idea about what’s happening. While some people show genuine interest by stopping and asking questions, others simply don’t care. That’s what makes my job so stressful—getting people to actually care. In one year, at the crux of my activism, my organization was able to raise over 9,000 dollars for Syrian orphans and refugees across the Middle East through our awareness and fundraising events.\nAs our organization grows, I hope to educate more people about the conflict and garner more financial support through our various events. Even though the majority of people do not seem to care, it’s the occasional caring stranger who restores my faith in humanity.\nNo matter how long it takes, I won’t give up on Syria.", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}

If at least most of us understood ourselves, our deepest thoughts, and our emotions and try to work on ourselves, this world would slightly become a better place. Over the years our technology has evolved but not our emotional intelligence and part of the reason why is because most of us don't take it too serious to do something about it. If we or at least the leaders of our society were 'emotionally' mature enough, we could've avoided so many wars and battles, extinction of civilizations. I'm a software engineer and this is my story answering, 'why': I bear a past full of tough occasions and rarely benign ones. For many years, when I was younger, I secretly wished for a friend ( or at least a pet dog ), who would support me thru' those times and with whom I could share. As I matured, that lack of such privilege made me antisocial and anthropomorphic towards computers. I started writing simple chatbots in my laptop using IF-ELSE, just to pretend that I had someone to talk to. Since it was entirely predefined, this thing of 'make believe' became boring gradually. I wanted my laptop to respond to me like a human would, unpredictable but contextual. One day on the internet, I came across an algorithm that could learn from it's mistakes and do better. It clicked and that was one of my ah-ha moments. This idea attracted me so much because I could see all the possibilities I could have, like Jarvis from the Iron Man, I thought I could program my own friend. That was the first day I officially and forever became a pursuer of A.I.

After I satisfied this goal of mine, I had more ideas. I built a chatbot that could take commands and execute, like Alexa, had a lot of fun building them. But then I also wanted to share them with others too. This lead me into the space of web development.

{"id": "9814", "text": "Book Review: Technopoly\nby Neil Postman\nMy Rating: 5/5\nWhen considering the impact of technology on modern society, the narrative is often framed as being between those who promote and push forward with developing technology and those who oppose it. Neil Postman argues that this is incorrect, and that the real frame of conflict is between technology and everyone else.\nThis narrative may seem unnecessarily confrontational and dramatic, but Postman makes a compelling argument. He details his points as to how technology is seen as a close friend, giving unconditionally its gifts to society and allowing us to avail of its use. He finds it important however to moderate the din of its enthusiasts by presenting his dissenting voice of opposition in which he details why he thinks that technology and its uncontrolled adoption and diffusion into society can contain many harmful effects. Technology is a friend he concedes, but it also has a dark side and its gifts come with costs.\nA common underlying theme throughout the book was that although technology has changed over time – indeed very rapidly over the last 150 years – the human brain and our social, mental, spiritual and physical needs have remained the same. Technology has not been able to allow us to rise above our very human constraints – and nor should it – for it is but an advancement of our tools, not our type. With this understanding, we can see how technology may introduce new links into society which leave our human brains and their modes of functionality at a clear disadvantage.\nPostman goes on to state that whenever we admit a new technology into our society, we should do so with cautious, weary eyes rather than the unfettered enthusiasm of a child excited about a new toy. Often a technology can introduce or even permanently alter our ways of establishing truth, knowledge and justice. Even with the introduction of the mathematical concept of zero, new ideas such as that of calculable debt were able to change how an economic and ownership system functioned.\nNew technology can also change what words mean. ‘Evidence’ may have historically been understood to mean witness testimony, but its definition has arguably been expanded to include technological evidence such as image captures or video footage. This has also changed what we mean when we say we ‘know’ what may have happened.\nOne very insightful example that has spared no-one in its effects was that given of the clock. According to Neil Postman, who himself references Lewis Mumford, clocks were initially used inside Monasteries where they helped to alert and inform the religious devotees as to the timings of their proscribed rituals. Once it was taken outside of the Monastery walls however, it permeated society and became a tool to synchonrise the actions of men and allowed the birth of modern Capitalism and the 9-5 as we know it. One could have hardly predicted its wide-ranging consequences when the technology was being introduced then, so will we take heed to this principle going forth? That is up to us.\nOther examples include how to spread of the Printing Press eventually led to an attack of the millennia-old Oral Tradition, and how the invention of the Telescope played a pivotal part of the disintegration of Christianity in Europe via the claims of Earth not being the centre of the universe and humans being removed from their pedestal of sacred uniqueness and importance. The subsequent decline of tradition and religion in Europe and America led to belief in the idea of constant moral, economic and social progress, the same idea which fuels our blind trust in technology today by virtue of association. Postman goes on to argue that we have now come to the point where we have replaced our idea of human progress with that of technological progress, our conflating of the two has led to the latter’s triumph.\nFurther commentary on the state of information overload the average person experiences on a daily basis allows Postman to raise further questions on how we have come to accept our current state. While some may adopt the idea that being advertised to is a normal fact of modern day life, I found it insightful and thought provoking to understand that the best sources of knowledge are often the most restrictive in what they are allow to teach and be taught. The example given of a University was something I found which described this best. As part of a university course, we are expected to limit our inputs to a limited number of verified and agreed upon sources. This limitation does not necessarily lower the quality of the knowledge gained, rather it is increased because of it. Here, quality is truly prioritised over quantity – so why do we accept anything less than this standard in day to day life?\nWe are continuously bombarded with information and see the addition of information from endless sources as a proof of our continuous advancement, but as shown – the best institutions for higher learning always limit their inputs. Should we not take our lesson from them? I also found it interesting when Neil Postman commented that Plato and Aristotle did not associate the need for efficiency and productivity with the refinement of a man’s mind. For them, the ideas did not mix. Achieving high efficiency and productivity was the goal of laborious work destined for slaves, it was not necessarily something which aided in the cause of human moral and intellectual advancement. Are we too in need of realising this truth once more?\nPostman goes on to claim America as the first society to give free reign to technology dominance and intrusion on society – the first real ‘Technopoly’. America was fertile ground for such a revolutionary change due to the natural distrust for constraints and the pervading frontier mentality when it came to business initiatives. This lack of concern for long term well-being allowed ample opportunity for ‘radical technological intrusions’ to work their way in to everyday society, the result being that people are generally heedless as to the origins and effects of the technologies that surround them. It is as though the sacred First Commandment has been appropriated to Science by which it is meant that there shall be no other god beside it.\nThe result of a Technopoly is the vast, gaping disconnect between our inherently human experience and the information digitised, numerated and presented to us via complex algorithms and ever increasing computers and machines. A vivid example provided is the now common reliance by medical professionals of their tools to the extent that they have almost entirely abandoned the subjective but real impact of an illness on the mental and psychological wellbeing of a patient. Quite often many of the doctors involved with a patient’s treatment may never even have direct contact with them, instead working on their ailments remotely via the study of medical machinery output which has translated their human pain into a machine-readable value. As Postman eloquently writes, a Technopoly aspires to remove as much mystery and subjectivity as it can and replace it with discrete figures and indisputable facts. Perhaps some aspects of the human enterprise however, are not amenable to this attempt at standardisation.\nTo conclude, this book was fundamental in opening my eyes to the envelopment of technology in our culture, and to not blindly accept the narrative that it is inherently good. It is hard to believe that this book was written in 1992 as it seems to describe contemporary culture perfectly. One can only imagine the horror Neil Postman would have expressed if he saw how society had changed since then.\nThe book is filled with countless more examples which made me redefine what it means to have a technology benefit a culture, and to understand that it also comes at a cost.\nSomething is gained, but now I understand that something will also be lost. It is up to us to watch its introduction with open eyes and to decide if it is worth the cost.\nIf you have the slightest curiosity about technology and its impact on culture, this book is for you. It is an incredibly important topic that punches above its weight in moderating the overwhelming discourse on how beneficial technology is to us, and provides a fundamental redefinition on what it means to make social progress.", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}
{"id": "9825", "text": "When you have people you’re responsible for, like a family, you have to plan for the inevitable. Since life is unpredictable, anything can happen, like an illness, an accident, or a job loss.\nIt’s impossible to foresee or even prevent certain eventualities, which makes insurance the best option for protecting your family.\nWith many insurance plans out there, settling on the perfect fit for your family can be challenging. And if that’s the case for you, this post can help steer you in the right direction.\n1.Figure Out Your Needs\nThe most important aspect of selecting an insurance policy for your family is figuring out your family’s needs. What form of insurance serves your family best?\nFor some, a health plan would be ideal for the family. Others may prefer business coverage to protect the family business. The policy you choose should match your family’s needs.\n2.Shopping for a Cover\nAs we discuss buying insurance coverage, it’s worth mentioning that many people benefit from their employer’s plan. Generally, it’s the employer’s health insurance.\nBut if you’re really putting your family’s needs first, it’s important to buy a separate plan independently so that you can ensure it aligns with your goals.\nThe best place to start is to work with a reputable insurance marketplace like FindaPlan. Good marketplaces are usually in partnership with hundreds of insurance providers and are in a position to provide you with the best quotes and insurance advice.\nSince marketplaces operate online, you could get set up in minutes, and that beats working with an agent if you want a fast and straightforward process.\n3.The Level of Cover You Need\nThe right insurance policy isn’t just the type but also the level of coverage you’re going for. If you’re wondering how much cover suits your family, we recommend a comprehensive one.\nFor instance, if you need a family health plan, the best coverage should reflect the family’s condition. You need a policy that covers a wide range of medical problems, including critical illness and maternity.\nKeep in mind that a comprehensive cover goes beyond the basics. That means you must know what a basic plan should look like to determine if the comprehensive plan offers you enough coverage.\nWondering how to get such a plan?\nWell, the trick is not to rush through your selection. Start by checking out different plans in the market and their requirements. What are their policy features and limitations?\nAlso, look for hidden factors like waiting periods and sub-limits, which people tend to miss.\n4.Consider Coverage Riders\nCoverage riders are additional terms you can add to your existing plan to expand it and make it even more beneficial.\nIt may happen that the insurance plan you’re going for isn’t adequate, but with the help of riders, you can make it more suitable for your needs. While riders come at an extra cost, they usually justify the added benefits and are better than securing a separate plan.\nBefore buying a family policy, remember to check the riders, as they can significantly enhance the scope of coverage at an affordable cost.\n5.Check the Copayment Clause\nHow much can you pay out of pocket?\nA copayment clause allows you to pay a percentage of the claim expense while the insurance company covers the rest.\nNot all insurance covers have a copayment feature. But it could be a mandatory feature in a senior citizen’s health insurance coverage, for instance.\nThe good thing about a copayment clause is that you can avoid paying higher premiums as it offers some relief through lower premium rates.\nFor example, if you have a policy with a 10% co-pay provision, you will have to pay $10,000 out of pocket for a $100,000 claim, while the insurance company pays $90,000 as part of the claim.\nBut hey, if such a deductible is justified through lower premiums, it’s probably a good deal for your family long-term.\n6.The Exclusion List is Crucial\nInsurance plans tend to have limits, even if it’s comprehensive coverage. These limits are called policy exclusions.\nIt’s crucial to go through this exclusion list to know what’s not covered by the insurance plan. That lets you weigh your options before moving forward to avoid buying inadequate cover.\nInsurance coverage for your family is a crucial safety net. With the right insurance policy, you protect your family’s financial security.\nHowever, with the many policies and providers out there, figuring out the right plan can be tedious. We hope the points we’ve shared will help you select the right insurance policy for your family.", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}

{"id": "9838", "text": "Biodiversity refers to the different life forms on earth, including plants, animals, insects and bacteria. Humans rely on biodiversity for food, water, medicine and a million other things. However, many species are threatened by extinction due to habitat loss and degradation, pollution, poaching, habitat fragmentation, and overexploitation.\nBiodiversity includes all the different kinds of life forms on Earth. This includes fungi, plants, animals and even microscopic organisms like bacteria, as well as the communities they form and the habitats where they live. Scientists and researchers estimate that our planet supports over 8.7 million species of plants and animals, but so far, they have only been able to identify a little over 1.2 million species.\nTypes Of Biodiversity\nOverall, there are three different types of biodiversity: species diversity, genetic diversity, and ecosystem diversity.\nSpecies diversity refers to the number of different species found within a habitat or population. Genetic diversity refers to the genetic variability within a given species. Ecosystem diversity, on the other hand, refers to the variations in ecosystems and habitats within different geographic locations. This includes differences in ecological niches, trophic levels and processes that make up food chains and food webs.\nWhy Is Biodiversity Important?\nEvery species on earth, be it a plant, animal or bacteria, plays a unique and important role that no other species can replicate. The intricate interactions between all these species and their ecosystems combined will help maintain the human race.\nBiodiversity is directly linked to our everyday lives; without it, we humans would not be able to survive. Apart from providing basic necessities like food, water, fodder and fuel, biological diversity also provides many critical ecological services, such as soil formation, nutrient cycling, and air and water purification.\nBroadly speaking, our planet’s biodiversity can be split into direct use values and indirect use values.\nThis refers to all the benefits we humans derive directly from the products that we harvest from nature. These values are further divided into consumptive and productive use values.\nConsumptive use values refer to our various bioresources, such as forest products, fuel-wood, herbs, medicinal plants and wild meat that are consumed directly and locally without being sold in markets. This includes food (e.g., plants, meat, fruits, seeds, flowers), medicinal resources (e.g., wild plants, fungus, algae, tree bark), and fuel (e.g., firewood).\nFor instance, in Zaire, 75% of the region’s animal protein comes from wild animals and in Botswana, over 50 wildlife species constitute food sources for local communities. Similarly, across the world, 25% of all prescription drugs are derived from around 120 plant species.\nProductive use value, on the other hand, refers to all the products harvested from nature and sold in local and international markets. This includes timber (e.g., for paper and pulp industries, railway sleepers and sawmills), fisheries (e.g., for consumption and aquaculture), ivory (for medicine and jewelry), and genetic material (to alter crops and domesticated animals).\nIndirect Value Use\nThese refer to all the products and services that nature provides us, and which isn’t harvested. This includes the infinite ecosystem processes and services, such as water purification, prevention of soil erosion, pollination, maintaining climate stability, and nutrient cycling. Similarly, biodiversity is also invaluable in many social, cultural and religious activities.\nApart from the indirect and direct values, biodiversity also has invaluable aesthetic, option and ethical values. For instance, the wilderness allows us to participate in activities like bird watching and gardening (aesthetic value), and may also be exceptionally important in the future for things like curing diseases (option value). Above all, biodiversity has an equal right to exist (ethical value).\nAs you can see, we depend on biodiversity on a daily basis, so you can probably guess how badly we will be affected if these services are no longer available to us. The loss of biodiversity will affect our livelihoods, food supply, income and migration, while also leading to political conflict over declining resources.\nUnfortunately, despite knowing the significance of biodiversity, our actions and lifestyles are leading to wide-scale biodiversity loss. For instance, at least 1 million species are threatened with extinction in the next decade, and over 800 million people, particularly in Asia and Africa, face food insecurity.\nYou may now stop and ask yourself: what are the causes of biodiversity loss? And what threatens biodiversity?\nWhat Causes Biodiversity Loss?\nOverall, the primary drivers of biodiversity loss are increasing human population growth and high levels of consumerism. Together, these two drivers lead to the elimination of biodiversity in many different ways.\nHabitat Degradation And Loss\nHabitat loss is the primary reason for large-scale biodiversity loss worldwide. When humans cut down trees, clear land for agriculture, cut grasslands or even fill wetlands, they are changing the natural habitat of all the species that live there. This not only leads to habitat destruction, but also drastically alters the complex interactions among different species.\nAccording to the recent report by the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES), humans have transformed over 75% of terrestrial surfaces and over 66% of ocean areas on earth. The main human activities that have led to such sweeping habitat loss are agriculture expansion, mining, logging, fishing, urbanization, and industrial growth. However, agricultural and livestock production are solely responsible for the conversion of 75% of freshwater resources and 33% of Earth’s land surface.\nSuch destruction of ecosystems and habitats will have infinite impacts on ecosystem services and ultimately human wellbeing. Among all ecosystems, wetlands, in particular, have suffered the most, as over 85% of wetlands have been lost by 2000.\nHabitat fragmentation occurs when large habitats are split into smaller and scattered patches as a result of changing land use and land covers. This prevents animals from dispersing from one area to another and isolates their populations in the region. Habitat fragmentation ultimately leads to inbreeding, stress, increased infant mortality and extinction. In fact, researchers found that species whose habitats were most fragmented were at a greater risk of extinction than those who had intact habitats.\nOverexploitation Of Resources\nSeveral species are overexploited due to their economic value, for medicinal and research purposes, which reduces their populations. Animals such as frogs, earthworms and plant species like ferns are all examples of bioresources that are heavily extracted.\nSome species are endemic to regions, while others are introduced (also known as exotic or alien species). The introduction of new species into new regions can be dangerous for native species and their communities, as exotic species deplete natural resources and degrade their habitats.\nA classic example of biodiversity loss because of exotic species is that of European rabbits in Australia. During the late 1850s, European rabbits were introduced into Australia for hunting. However, these rabbits grew exponentially and spread across the country like wildfire; in the process, they destroyed crops, land and soil. They also led to the decline of several native plant and animal species. In more recent times, researchers have found that since the 1970s, the number of exotic species across 21 different countries has increased by over 70%.\nPoaching And Wildlife Trade\nMany wildlife species, such as pangolins, tigers, turtles, star tortoises and snakes, are traded illegally for their meat, fur, skin, tusks and teeth. Poachers ruthlessly kill wildlife of all ages, genders, sizes, and species. While poaching is rampant worldwide, some regions such as Asia, Africa and South America, which are all extremely rich in biodiversity, witness a greater number of poaching cases. For instance, between 2014 and 2017, 100,000 African elephants were killed by ivory poachers across the African continent.\nToxic chemicals, liquids and gases are released into our environment, which alter natural habitats. For instance, pesticides used in farms enter nearby water bodies, such as ponds and rivers, and kill fish, the birds that feed on fish, and other related animals. Since the 1980s, over 300 million tons of heavy metals, industrial waste and sludge have been dumped into our waterways, leading to the creation of 400 different ‘dead zones’ in the ocean. The introduction of these chemicals not only causes pollution, but also leads to eutrophication, reduces oxygen levels, causes coral bleaching, metal poisoning and ultimately biodiversity loss.\nWhile these are the major causes of biodiversity loss, there are several other factors, such as disease and human-wildlife conflict, which also threaten the survival of many species.\nAs you can see, our environment and its biodiversity are directly linked to our survival. Hence, it is our responsibility to ensure that we respect and protect it, not only for ourselves, but also for the future generations, who will also depend on it to survive and thrive.\nHow well do you understand the article above!\nReferences (click to expand)\n- Biodiversity - National Geographic Society.

{"id": "9859", "text": "New dimensions on Nepal-China friendship\nPhewa Lake is a very famous as a scenic spot and tourist destination located in Kaski District, Gandaki Province of Nepal. Located in the Pokhara Valley, this lake is popular among internal and external tourists. The lake has a panoramic view of Machhapuchhre and Annapurna Himal. The lake also offers majestic reflections of Machhapuchhre and Annapurna Himal on its surface. These scenes bring joy to everyone’s mind. The view of the sunrise and sunset is also very stunning and makes the mind happy.\nA Dragon Boat Festival in Phewa Lake was organised recently. The lake was decorated with eight dragon boat teams who competed fiercely against each other during the first Nepal-China dragon boat race festival. On the day, Mt. Machhapuchhre, was clearly visible along with the Annapurna range, adding colour to the boat racing.\nEach of the eight teams comprised one drummer, one cox and 10 rowers, and among the eight teams were four Nepali teams, two Chinese teams, one team from Singapore and one team involving both Nepali and Chinese nationals.\nThe rowers, to the rhythm of the drum beats and braving the scorching sun, rowed hard their dragon-shaped boats to the finish lines in unison, sparking waves now and then. The spectators, either on the bank or in the boats, waved Nepali and Chinese national flags to cheer for their favourite teams.\nOn the first day of the competition, preliminary rounds were held for 200m and 500m races, and the semi-finals and final shall be conducted the following day.\nPrior to the boat racing, a Sichuan Airlines charter flight arrived at the Pokhara International Airport on last Wednesday, becoming the first international flight to land at the third international airport of Nepal since its inauguration in January.\nAnd as the sister city of Pokhara, Nepal’s second-largest city and a popular tourist attraction, Linzhi in China’s Tibet Autonomous Region sent artists to hold special performances to mark the dragon boat race festival.\nAddressing the opening ceremony of the boat racing, Nepal’s Minister for Culture, Tourism and Civil Aviation Sudan Kirati conveyed best wishes on behalf of Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal.\n“It has become an inexhaustible driving force for us to create a better future,” Chen said at the opening ceremony, adding that the boat racing is held to implement the Global Civilization Initiative, promote Nepal’s tourism and the awareness of Pokhara in China and the world.\nThe Dragon Boat Festival, also known as “DuanwuJie” in Chinese, is one of the four important traditional festivals in China. It observes on the fifth day of the fifth month by the Chinese lunar calendar, which falls on 22nd June in 2023.\nThe legend behind the Dragon Boat Festival is associated with Qu Yuan (340- DRAGON BOAT FESTIVAL 278 BC), a loyal state minister and patriotic poet who lived in the kingdom of Chu during the Warring States period (475-221 BC).\nQu Yuan was deeply concerned about the political corruption and internal strife that plagued his country. As his warnings went unheeded, he composed powerful poems expressing his love and sorrow for his country. ‘When he realized his beloved country was beyond recovery and he could no longer save it, Qu Yuan committed suicide in despair by drowning himself in the Miluo River, which is located in today’s Hunan Province.\nThe local people, who admired Qu Yuan and were devastated by his death, rushed out in boats to search for his body. To prevent fish and evil spirits from devouring Qu Yuan’s body, people beat drums and splashed the water with paddles to scare them away, and also threw sticky rice wrapped in bamboo leaves, known as “Zongzi” into the river. These practices eventually evolved into the tradition of the Dragon Boat Race and the consumption of “Zongzi” during the Dragon Boat Festival nowadays.\nDragon Boat Race involves teams of rowers paddling in long, narrow boats shaped like dragons. The races are usually held in rivers, lakes, and other bodies of water, with participants striving to paddle their boats to the finish line in the shortest possible time. It promotes teamwork and physical fitness, Dragon Boat Race has gained popularity in China and is now enjoyed by people in many countries around the world. The Dragon Boat Race has been a cultural exchange and community engagement.", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}
{"id": "9876", "text": "If you believe the BC Jobs plan, we're on the cusp of an economic boom in the province's natural resource and shipbuilding sectors. That's the good news.\nThe bad? We're also facing a skills shortage that means thousands to tens of thousands of British Columbians could miss out on the bonanza. Consider these three points:\n-- The provincial Labour Market Outlook predicts openings for 153,000 skilled trades people over the next decade -- tens of thousands more than the current supply of workers.\n-- The Ministry of Jobs, Tourism and Innovation says there will be more than 104,600 skilled trade jobs opening up over the next decade; it also anticipates we'll be short 2,340 trades people by 2020.\n-- The British Columbia and Yukon Territory Building and Construction Trades Council predicts a shortfall of 20,000 trades people that same year.\nWhatever statistic you pick, the future looks bright for trades people in British Columbia. An increase in available jobs in the province has a chance of putting a serious dent in B.C.'s unemployment rate. And with skilled trades earning well above minimum wage, more jobs could reduce the province's high rate of individual and family poverty.\nBut first British Columbians need the skills to get those jobs. That's put a new spotlight on the Industry Training Authority's (ITA) role of facilitating the qualification of future electricians, plumbers, carpenters and other trades. The skilled labour shortage that government and industry predicts would be even larger without the ITA, a provincial agency that funds and monitors all trades training and apprenticeships in B.C. On the other hand, if British Columbians are going to be available to fill all of those available jobs, we also need the ITA to do that.\nSince its inception in 2004 however, the agency has faced criticism for being disorganized and out of touch. The complaints have come from every quarter: from unions, industry, politicians, and even the province's Auditor-General.\nThe unhappy evidence is in the statistics: B.C.'s apprenticeship completion rate has hovered around 40 per cent for years, while the national average is 50 per cent, and Alberta's rate sits at 78 per cent. (However, those statistics are debated in the province; see part two of this series tomorrow for more.)\n\"The Authority, as an industry trainer, has been doing just-in-time training. You can go in, get a component of training that's required for a job that's immediately required somewhere,\" says Tom Sigurdson, executive director of The British Columbia and Yukon Territory Building and Construction Trades Council, a union umbrella organization. But the trade-off for such last-minute filling of skill gaps, Sigurdson says, is that \"there's no comprehensive training.\"\n\"The ITA as it's currently structured is not providing British Columbia with the services that are necessary to get us through the skill shortage,\" the union executive adds.\nSince a predecessor agency, the Industry Training and Apprenticeship Commission (ITAC) (see sidebar), was replaced by the ITA in 2004, critics like Sigurdson have charged that apprentices are left to figure out a complex industry on their own. Instead of the closer participation from industry that was anticipated when the new agency was launched, they say, not enough employers fund training or take on apprentices.\nToday we'll take a look at some of the criticisms that have been leveled at the ITA. Tomorrow we'll examine some solutions being suggested to help meet demands for skilled labour while improving lives for British Columbians.\nWhen Ryan Paton started his apprenticeship in 2007, he knew he was one of the first students to try out the ITA's new glazing program. He didn't know it would be so frustrating. Before Paton started, glazing apprentices were divided into Levels 1, 2, and 3 to earn their Red Seal -- the highest qualification in trades nation-wide. Then the ITA changed to a system of modules: A through G.\nEvery student had to take Module A, but you chose other modules based on what you wanted to learn: commercial versus residential glazing, doors versus auto glass, and so on.\nPaton had expected to become a skilled glazier with knowledge in many areas of glasswork. What the ITA was offering instead, he felt, was a chance to become a technician.\n\"The ethical problem,\" he explains, \"was it was trying to detract from having skilled, ticketed tradesmen (who) knew everything about their field and could make informed decisions about what they were doing on the job site and build safer, better buildings.\n\"You wouldn't necessarily have to take all of (the modules), and you wouldn't necessarily have to get a Red Seal at the end of it, you could become a storefront technician or a curtain wall technician and you'd only know that little bit.\"\nCurriculum for the new program was taken directly from installation manuals produced by a commercial glass and aluminum supplier, Kawneer. Nor was the revised curriculum completed when it was delivered to Paton and his classmates. He credits his instructor at the Finishing Trades Institute of British Columbia for supplementing the official course with materials from the international glaziers union.\nBut he says he could tell the program was disorganized. Halfway through his glaziers' training, the ITA switched back to the levels system, although they kept the new curriculum. This meant Paton had to spend four years apprenticing instead of three.\nIn addition, because most other trades programs still operated on levels, not modules, many glazing students were deemed ineligible for apprenticeship incentive grants. Paton only received $3,000 of the $4,000 in grant money he had expected.\n\"If I wasn't as driven to get a good education, asking lots of questions, I don't think I would have gotten as much out of (my apprenticeship) as I did,\" says Paton, who now has his Red Seal.\nGive more responsibility to ITOs\nA major difference between the ITA and its predecessor, the ITAC, is the major role industry was supposed to play. Under ITAC, government, colleges, labourers, and industry all had an equal say, and equal power to veto any decisions. The ITA was supposed to be different, more focused on the needs of industries that wish to employ skilled trades.\nIndustry plays its role in the ITA through seven not-for-profit Industry Training Organizations (ITO). Overseen by industry representatives, each advisory ITO is responsible for ensuring adequate training for a certain trades sector in the province. Russ Robertson, CEO of the transportation trades ITO, explains how he sees his role: \"[We] understand what ITA is looking for, and we're able to facilitate industry to identify the range of solutions to resolve some of the shortage of skilled labour, or upgrade the quality of the product coming out of the system, or look at do we have too many schools offering the courses, (or) looking at the quality of instruction in those schools.\"\nOther ITOs represent the automotive, tourism and hospitality, construction, horticulture, resource and residential construction industries. Provincial funding for the ITA -- $94.4 million annually for the past six years -- also supports the ITOs. Funding levels differ for each. In 2011 the highest funding was for the Construction Industry Training Organization (CITO), which received $1.9 million; the lowest was $265,500 for HortEducationBC, the horticultural ITO. In all, the ITA spent $5.8 million on ITOs last year -- $5.2 million more than it spent in 2005/06.\nBut their responsibilities are ambiguous. Robertson points to the ITA's \"Shareholders' Letter of Expectations,\" in which the ministry responsible for the ITA -- in its role as its \"shareholders\", AKA British Columbians -- details its expectations of the Crown agency for the coming fiscal year. The 2007/'08 letter says the industry panels will work with the ITA to \"develop policies and standards to support the delivery of training programs... qualification assessments, examinations, and credentials for programs administered by the Authority.\" But in the 2011/'12 letter the ITOs are instead tasked with implementing \"an action plan to further expand employer participation in industry training including sponsorship of apprentices.\"\nRobertson says this signals a \"major shift in ITA,\" from involving ITOs in developing new, market-relevant curriculum, focusing solely on getting employers to hire apprentices. \"There's no longer the emphasis on maintaining up-to-date or aligned industry programs, updating the program standards, no reference to the ITOs going out and promoting or marketing the youth programs, and trying to attract more people into these occupations in each of the ITOs' area of responsibility,\" he told The Tyee Solutions Society.\nConfusion about the groups' contribution is nothing new. A 2008 Auditor-General's audit criticized the training authority for not having a clear idea of the advisory bodies' roles or funding needs. Auditor-General John Doyle said ITOs should either be treated as employees of the ITA or its contractors, but that the ITA needed to decide which role they should play. Kevin Evans, CEO of the ITA, says that problem has been fixed. Each of the ITOs signed Enterprise Partnership Agreements in 2009. But instead of working with the ITA as more-or-less equal voices, the ITOs were now paid to deliver specified services. The first generation of these agreements expired earlier this year. Most were renewed.\nOne ITO didn't make the cut. The Residential Construction Industry Training Organization (RCITO) received $450,000 from the ITA last year. In February it was informed that because its member industries weren't registering with the ITA to support apprentices, and few apprentices were signing up for RCITO trades, they would no longer receive ITA funding as of March 31.\nEvans told The Tyee Solutions Society that employer sponsorship of apprentices under RCITO dropped from 19 per cent of residential construction employers in 2010/11 to only nine per cent in 2011/12. The ITA previously moved traditional residential trades assigned to RCITO, such as carpentry, to the Construction Industry Training Organization. This left RCITO with newer, more-residential specific trades like geothermal, heat and building envelope technicians, and residential interior and exterior finishing.\nMary Kenny, CEO of RCITO, says employers had signed up to accept apprentices, but all of RCITO's trades, except log building, are brand new. The ITA has not even designated three of the trades, meaning colleges and trades schools can't offer apprenticeship classes in them. Kenny says many employers grew frustrated with the wait times to have courses approved -- as long as four years in some cases -- and just dropped off the list.\n\"Many residential employers do hire apprentices in the traditional programs but are frustrated with the lack of appropriate skills and knowledge that they bring to the trade. They have been waiting for the new residential-based apprenticeships,\" she said in an email.\nThe ITA labels several RCITO trades inactive, meaning there is no technical training available anywhere in B.C. Kenny says the ITA doesn't always consult with industry before they make a trade inactive.\n\"1.6 million [households] we have in British Columbia, and we're saying that we don't need to have an industry training organization to coordinate trades training for that industry,\" she said. \"In my mind that is scandalous.\"\nKenny says RCITO isn't the only ITO with a drop in employers hiring apprentices. Evans agrees, saying during a recent episode of the Shaw TV program Voice of B.C. that he's seen a drop in employers hiring apprentices across the board. He says it's typical for a recession, and it took 10 years for numbers to recover after the previous recession. NDP Higher Education Critic Michelle Mungall says other ITOs have been airing their frustrations to her. \"The feedback I get from the ITOs,\" she says, \"is they're not really sure what their role is. There are some defined roles, but just because it's in black and white on the Internet doesn't necessarily mean that's what's being done in practice.\"\nKerry Jothen is another observer who believes the ITOs are underused. Now running a consulting firm, Human Capital Strategies, Jothen was CEO of the ITA's predecessor body, the ITAC.\n\"I think that ITA needs to let the ITOs do more. The ITOs are the arm of industry, the mechanism through which industries can participate in and be supportive of the trades apprenticeships, and I think the ITA needs to better support the Industry Training Organizations on that,\" he says.\nWho's hiring apprentices anymore?\nFor its part, the ITA feels industry just isn't pulling its weight when it comes to supporting apprentices. Almost 80 per cent of trade skills are acquired in the field, where employers hire apprentices and provide training on the job. But according to ITA's Evans, not nearly enough employers are taking in trainees. Speaking on cable access program Voice of B.C., Evans revealed that 9,000 companies in B.C. were employing apprentices, a number he says is large, but not enough. Employers can offer to train current employees, too. Canada as a whole, he added, has a poor record of employer training compared to other countries as measured by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.\nBut Evans said employers can't poach workers from the competition or hire qualified immigrants to meet their needs.\n\"If you are not training, you are not going to be able to participate in the economy of the 21st century,\" Evans said. \"This is just a core recognition that it's not somebody else's job to train. It's all of our jobs if we're employers.\"\nEducation sealed, not delivered\nBut more apprenticeship positions alone aren't enough. Some employers, Robertson said, take on apprentices for the wrong reasons, seeing them as cheap labour rather than potential journeymen.\n\"They'll have them do menial tasks for four years, and then write their exams. They get their Red Seal but they're not qualified,\" he said. \"They haven't been exposed to the full scope of the job.\"\nOther employers simply can't afford to train for the future. Evans estimates that 98 per cent of B.C. employers are small-to-medium size businesses, many of them more worried about making it through the next quarter -- or payroll -- than the next 10 years. A lack of skilled trade applicants doesn't just shortchange B.C. workers who miss an opportunity to land a well-paying job either. Employers are also impacted: forced to spend extra money to induce existing workers to take on overtime, or pass on work and lose out on revenue.\nNDP MLA Mungall cites the Mt. Milligan Mine, 155 kilometres northwest of Prince George.\n\"Mount Milligan Mine is now facing a cost overrun of about $200 million because they cannot get the skilled labour,\" she said. \"These are people with very specific skills that come in to develop the mine, and if you have to employ one person longer rather than having two people, it takes longer to develop the mine and you have a backlog before you can actually start making money.\"\nNor is B.C. the only place facing a skilled labour shortage. The demand for skilled workers is ramping up globally, Jothen said, and the competition is getting fierce. B.C. employers aren't competing for skills just with other local businesses. They're competing with the rest of the world.\n\"A lot of the same trades are in very high demand,\" he said.\nJothen acknowledges that some industries aren't stepping up to the plate on training. But industries are just as frustrated with the ITA. \"Some employers have gotten frustrated with ITA,\" the consultant believes, \"and maybe don't see that ITA is responsive enough to their skill requirements and fast enough to help them.\"\nWith most trades programs taking at least three years to complete, any changes will take time to show fruit. But with less than a decade before job openings are expected to surpass available workers, time is not on the ITA's side.\nTomorrow: What's missing in B.C. trades training? The story of one young apprentice.\nRead more: Labour + Industry", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}

However, there are significant differences between them that affect their performance on a vehicle.\nAn 18-inch wheel is one of the larger diameter wheels that need lower profile tires to maintain stability and enable good clearance on the road, especially when it comes in contact with bumps, curbs, and potholes.\nAnd with larger rims, the suspension compresses and rebounds.\nHowever, you get shorter, stiffer sidewalls with this size because larger wheels are matching with lower-profile tires.\nAnd if that persists, there is a good chance that a pothole can destroy your wheels and tires.\nIn retrospect, some larger diameter wheels and tires have better handling and high-speed performance than low profile tires that guarantee a firmer but noisy ride than fresh rubber.\nA 16-inch wheel, on the other hand, is a smaller wheel but comes with a larger and taller sidewall, providing good cushioning against road hazards, including sharp edges, potholes, and bumps.\nThis wheel, however, is cheaper and guarantees better fuel consumption. It also produces minimal road noise.\nOne more noticeable difference is the unsprung weight. Generally, adding an extra pound of unsprung weight affects every other thing such as braking, cornering, and acceleration.\nSo, in summary, the difference between the two sizes is weight, handling, price, ride harshness, and road noise.\nWhat is the advantage of an 18 inch wheel size?\nIf you must use 18 wheels (or other bigger wheels), then, you need to know the advantages that come with them. They include:\nBetter Road Comfort and Traction\nLarger wheels guarantee a comfortable ride. The reason is that they are mostly merged with smaller sidewalls.\nAnd because of this, there is reduced air pressure, making it only possible for it to maintain more contact with the road and deliver excellent traction on dry and wet roads.\nHowever, the interesting thing is that air cushion in smaller diameter tires only helps improve ride quality. They act as shock absorbers when going over potholes and bumps – hence, maintaining stability.\nIt also produces low road noise and delivers the best driving performance.\nApart from a better ride and sidewall flex, there is also good engine maintenance with big wheels. There is less pressure on the engine to speed up the car.\nThat means 18 wheels decrease wear on expansion joints, suspension and brake assembly.\nGood Fuel Economy\nSince a larger wheel is moving at slower speeds, there is reduced mileage. That makes it able to save fuel. However, the ability to do this sometimes depends on the car’s power.\nWhat is the disadvantage of an 18 inch wheel size?\nIf there are good things to say about the 18 wheels, there should also be bad ones.\nAs an 18-inch wheel increases the maximum load of your vehicle, the only problem most people have with it is the appearance. It looks so aggressive and powerful.\nEven though you get good performance, you will spend more money getting larger diameter wheels and lower profile tires.\nWhat is the advantage of 16 inch rims?\nLet’s check out the benefits of using a 16 inch wheel or tyre on a vehicle below.\nOne of the noticeable features of the 16 rims is the larger sidewalls. With this feature, your vehicle is able to maintain good contact with the road and produce minimal road noise – hence, a comfortable ride.\nSmaller wheels like the 16 inch are better at ensuring a good contact patch. However, one thing more than anything else is to provide good traction for all road conditions.\nWithout an additional weight, a 16-inch wheel is an affordable option and it comes in varieties depending on vehicle fitment.\nWhat is the disadvantage of 16 inch wheel sizes?\nThe disadvantage of this wheel or tyre is:\nAs comfortable as your ride can be, it may not be a stable one because the wheels are small to absorb bumps or impact from the road. In turn, they start developing suspension and speed issues.\nIn short, a 16-inch tyre may not deliver the best performance for road driving.\nDoes wheel size affect ride quality? – lighter wheels or larger wheel sizes?\nYes, it does.\nGenerally, wheel size determines ride quality. Handling, Noise level, and Overall Performance are influenced by this factor.\nHowever, before you choose a wheel size, you need to consult some factors, such as vehicle type, budget, and sidewall height. And while at that, you need to keep in mind a rule of thumb:\n- Larger wheels/rims have a rougher ride quality, high stability, responsive handling, and high road noise.\n- Medium rims have a good ride quality, average stability, predictable handling, and average road noise.\n- Smaller rims have the best ride quality but low stability, predictable handling, and minimal road noise.\nIf you know this, then you know what to expect when you get a wheel size for your car.\nOther things you need to consider are car weight, engine, suspension, and transmission.\nDoes Tire Size Affect Ride?\nYes, it does.\nIt would surprise many car owners to know that tire size has more effect on handling, noise level, and even drive quality than wheel size.\nIf you have a bad tire, there is a likely chance you have problems with body roll, stability, grip, and traction.\nHowever, new tires provide excellent traction, stability, and cornering.\nMore so, you need to make sure your wheels are properly aligned with your tires. If misaligned, you will experience uneven tire wear in no time, and that affects the quality of your ride more than anything else.\nWhy sidewall profile matter more than size?\nBefore choosing the side of your wheels and tires, the sidewall profile is an important feature to consider. It determines what happens to your suspension, speedometer, and odometer readings.\nIf you don’t match the wheel with the correct sidewall, your wheels may be turning at a totally different speed that poses a threat to even your safety.\nLarger wheels go well with short, stiff sidewalls, while smaller wheels go with tall sidewalls.\nDo smaller rims ride better?\nIf there is anything that comes from the combination of smaller wheels and tires, it is a comfortable ride.\nThis combination also enhances good mileage, better car acceleration, and minimal road noise.\nBesides, the rule of thumb is: “larger wheels mean rougher ride.; smaller wheels mean smoother rides.“\nWhy is a larger diameter wheel ride better?\nYour car has more grip on the road.\nIf there is something larger diameter wheels and tires guarantee, it has more grip with the road. This is only because as you have wider tires, there is more surface area to cover.\nThus, you get more contact with the road due to this increased width – in the process, handling increases, and cornering around sharp edges won’t be difficult.\nIn short, larger wheels improve handling and high-speed performance.\nWhat is Plus Sizing?\nPlus Sizing is a situation where car owners choose larger diameter wheels with shorter/stiffer sidewalls over the ones provided by the manufacturer.\nHowever, the interesting thing about this sizing is that the tire’s outer diameter is unaffected, so speedometer and odometer readings are usual.\nThe benefit of doing this is to get better cornering, grip, handling, and overall performance.\nIf you are confused about what to choose between the 16 and 18-wheel/tyre sizes, this article has explained everything you need to know.\nWhile you learn about the benefits of either wheel or tire size, you also see the disadvantages and know what to expect.\nChoose whatever you think delivers the absolute real-world experience of driving you are looking for.\nAnd if you must buy wheels and tires worth the money, ensure to visit a reliable auto shop in your location.", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}
{"id": "9891", "text": "Efficient hydrolysis of cellulosic biomass to glucose is a grand challenge for the realization of a nonfood biorefinery. In recent years, solid catalysts have attracted significant attention for biomass conversion, as they can be separated from product solutions and their functions can be designed. In this chapter, we describe activated carbons that can hydrolyze cellulose and real biomass to glucose in yields up to 88 % in the presence of a trace amount of hydrochloric acid. Creating contacts between the solid catalyst and the solid substrate by ball-milling is the key to realizing the potential of this catalytic system. Activated carbon adsorbs cellulosic molecules by van der Waals forces, CH-Π hydrogen bonds, and hydrophobic interactions between the polyaromatic surface of the carbon and the axial planes of glucans, namely, hydrophobic groups. Subsequently, the weakly acidic groups of the carbon surface such as carboxylic acids cleave the glycosidic bonds of cellulose via oxocarbenium intermediates, for which the salicylic acid structure is especially effective.\n|Title of host publication\n|Reaction Pathways and Mechanisms in Thermocatalytic Biomass Conversion I\n|Subtitle of host publication\n|Cellulose Structure, Depolymerization and Conversion by Heterogeneous Catalysts\n|Number of pages\n|Published - 2015 Sept 25\n- Activated carbon", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}
{"id": "9894", "text": "This past Thursday the BBC published an article about Gianna Mulville-Zanetta, a first year Social Policy student at Bristol University in the UK.\nAfter getting caught downloading the stop-motion comedy-drama film Chicken Run using BitTorrent, the 18-year-old reportedly felt the wrath of the university’s IT department.\n“I completely forgot I had downloaded it,” Gianna told the BBC.\n“I got an email the day after I watched it on Netflix with my friend saying I had been removed from Eduroam – which is our wifi. It took about a day or more to download and that’s why I forgot I had it, it took forever.”\nFor her sins, Gianna was blocked from using the university’s wifi for 20 days, a period that coincided with her exams. With access to a 4G connection she says the ban didn’t affect her studies but of course, the potential for chaos was certainly there.\nThere appears to be no doubt that Gianna committed an infringement. However, that someone who prefers to watch something legally on Netflix gets caught up in something like this is pretty disappointing. But not a complete surprise.\nChicken Run was released in 2000 but only 12 years later did it appear on UK Netflix. According to New on Netflix, it was withdrawn from Netflix during November 2013, put back on two years later in 2015, removed a year later in 2016, and was only re-added on May 1 this year.\nConsidering the BBC states that the Chicken Run affair “has ruined much of May for Gianna”, the ban must’ve kicked in early this month. That means that Chicken Run was either not on UK Netflix when Gianna decided on her download, or had only been there for a day or two. Either way, if there had been less yo-yo’ing of its availability on Netflix, it’s possible this whole affair could’ve been completely avoided.\nMoving on, the BBC article states that Gianna was “caught out by the university’s IT department.” Student newspaper The Tab makes a similar assumption, claiming that Gianna was “busted by an elite team of University IT technicians.”\nHowever, those familiar with these issues will know that the ‘blame’ should be placed elsewhere, i.e., on rightsholders who are filing complaints directly with the university. The tactic is certainly an interesting one.\nDespite there being dozens of residential ISPs the copyright holders could focus on, they choose not to do so outside the limited scope of the Get it Right campaign instead. Knowing that universities come down hard on students seems like a motivating factor here, one that students should be aware of.\nThe Tab went on to publish a screenshot of the complaint received by Gianna. It’s incomplete, but it contains information that allows us to investigate further.\nThe note that Gianna’s connection had been suspended to prevent the IT department from “receiving further complaints” is a dead giveaway of rightsholder involvement. But, further down is an even clearer clue that the complaint was made by someone outside the university.\nThe format used in the complaint is identical to that used by US and Australia-based anti-piracy outfit IP-Echelon. The company is known to work with Paramount Pictures who own the rights to Chicken Run.\nIn fact, if one searches the filesize referenced in the infringement notice (572,221,548), it’s possible to find an identical complaint processed by VPN service Proxy.sh.\nGiven the file size, we can further deduce that Gianna downloaded a 720p BrRip of Chicken Run that was placed online by now defunct release team/torrent site YIFY, which has also been referenced in a number of complaints sent to Google.\nSo what can we conclude from these series of events?\nFirst of all, with less messing around by Paramount and/or Netflix, Gianna might have gone to Netflix first, having seen it previously in the listings on the platform. As it goes, it had been absent for months, having been pulled from the service at least twice before.\nSecond, we know that at least one person who chose to pirate Chicken Run avoided Gianna’s predicament by using a VPN service. While Gianna found herself disconnected, the VPN user walked away completely unscathed, with Paramount and IP-Echelon complaining to the VPN service and that being the end of the matter.\nThird, allowing your real name and a copy of a copyright infringement complaint to be published alongside a confession is a risky business. While IP-Echelon isn’t known for pressuring people to pay settlements in the UK, the situation could have been very different if a copyright troll was involved.\nFourth, we can also conclude that while it’s believed that older content is safer to download, this story suggests otherwise. Chicken Run was released 17 years ago and is still being monitored by rightsholders.\nFinally, stories of students getting banned from university Internet access are relatively commonplace in the United States, but the same out of the UK is extremely rare.\nIn fact, we’re not aware of such exclusions happening on a regular basis anywhere in the region, although Gianna told the BBC that she knows another person who is still being denied access to the Internet for downloading Shrek, another relatively ancient film.\nThat raises the possibility that some copyright holders have seriously begun targeting universities in the UK. If that’s the case, one has to question what has more value – uninterrupted Internet access while on campus or a movie download.", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}

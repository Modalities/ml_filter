{"id": "2", "text": "As fun as craps can get, to truly enjoy the game and avoid any potential faux pas, it’s important to understand the craps etiquette at the table.\nIn this guide I will walk you through the do’s and don’ts of craps etiquette.\nLet’s get started!\n1. Never Hand Cash to the Dealer\nIn a game of craps, it’s important to remember that you should never hand cash directly to the dealer.\nThis isn’t a personal slight, but rather a standard casino rule.\nIf you want to buy-in, wait for a pause between rolls, place your cash on the table, make eye contact with the dealer, and say, “Change, please.”\n2. Keep the Dice Visible\nWhen you’re the shooter (the person rolling the dice), always keep the dice visible. Don’t remove them from the table or hide them from the dealer.\nThis is to ensure fair play and maintain the integrity of the game.\n3. Don’t Buy-in During a Roll\nNever attempt to buy-in or exchange cash for chips when the shooter has the dice. Wait for the dealer to indicate when it’s okay to place bets and when you should not.\nIf you’re playing, ensure the dealer confirms any bet you’re trying to place before the shooter rolls the dice.\n4. Respect the Pace of the Game\nAs the shooter, you control the pace of the game. When it’s your turn, just shoot the dice. Avoid unnecessary delays, such as blowing on the dice, which can also spread germs.\nIf you don’t feel like shooting, you can always “pass right” and let the next player take their turn.\n5. Passing Right\nIf you don’t want to shoot, it’s perfectly acceptable to pass the dice to the player on your right.\nTo do this, open your hand with the dice in your palm and indicate them towards the next player in a clockwise manner.\n6. Hands High\nWhen the dealer says, “Hands high” or “the dice are out”, lift your hands off the table.\nThis ensures you’re not interfering with the play and the dice can be passed to the shooter without obstruction.\n7. Be Respectful to Other Players\nGood manners are essential at the craps table.\nAvoid hanging your hands over the edge of the rail or resting drinks on the rail. Excessive drinking can lead to disruptive behavior, so it’s best to drink responsibly.\nKeep the table clean and free from drinks and cigarette ashes.\n8. Ask the Dealer for Help\nIf you’re unsure about the different bets or any aspect of the game, feel free to ask the dealer for help. However, don’t rely on the dealer to coach you throughout the game.\nThe craps table can get crowded, and dealers need to focus on managing the game.\n9. Don’t Forget to Tip\nTipping the dealer is a common courtesy, regardless of whether you win or lose. Never hand a dealer money directly.\nInstead, place money or chips on the table for tipping purposes and clearly state what the money is for. You can also place a bet for your dealer as a tip.\nCraps is an exciting and engaging game that brings together people from all walks of life.\nUnderstanding and practicing proper craps etiquette not only enhances your gaming experience but also contributes to a friendly and respectful atmosphere at the table.\nRemember, the goal is to have fun and enjoy the game.\nBy following these craps etiquette guidelines, you’ll be able to participate in the game smoothly, make new friends, and create memorable experiences.\nSo, whether you’re a seasoned player or a newbie, step up to the craps table with confidence and respect, and let the good times roll!", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

The Spaniard's rookie McLaren teammate, Lewis Hamilton, completed his impressive debut weekend with a podium.\nHamilton was one of the stars of a race that saw most of the action take place behind the leaders. The Briton, fourth on the grid, jumped to third at the start as Alonso was forced to back off and dropped to P4 while fighting with Nick Heidfeld's BMW for second place.\nAt the end of trouble-free first lap - Anthony Davidson's Super Aguri seemed to stall at the start, but the former Honda tester was able to continue -Raikkonen already led Heidfeld by 1.2sec, with Hamilton, Alonso, Robert Kubica in the second BMW, Renault's Giancarlo Fisichella, Red Bull's Mark Webber and Toyota's Ralf Schumacher rounding out the top-eight.\nRaikkonen's teammate Felipe Massa gained four spots at the start, moving up to 18th. The Brazilian had started last, after qualifying 16th due to gearbox problems, then losing 10 grid spots with an engine-change penalty.\nDespite being on hard tires versus Heidfeld's soft compound - as a novelty in the 2007 regulations, drivers are obligated to use both tire variations during the race - Raikkonen had no trouble in pulling away from the German in a rate of over half a second per lap. By the time Heidfeld kicked off the first round of pitstops for the frontrunners, on lap 14, he trailed Raikkonen by over eight seconds.\nBefore that, however, Christijan Albers had the dubious honor of being the first driver to retire in the 2007 season, and in a bizarre manner. The Dutch driver missed a braking zone inexplicably, crashing his Spyker against the tire barriers. Afterwards, Albers admitted he got distracted while adjusting the car's radio.\nMeanwhile Massa's recovery drive came to a halt when he reached the 16th spot and the Hondas of Jenson Button and Rubens Barrichello. The Briton, with a heavy fuel load, slowed down both Brazilians for eight laps before being overtaken by Barrichello on lap 14 and by Massa two laps later.\nCatch up on the latest Formula 1 developments each month in RACER. Check out our look at how Kimi Raikkonen settled in at Ferrari over the winter in our April issue, on sale now!\nRaikkonen pitted early, on the 18th lap, giving Hamilton the opportunity to lead five laps on his maiden race. The rookie came in on the 23rd, one lap after teammate Alonso, and the top-three positions remained unchanged. Heidfeld was the biggest loser in the initial round of stops, dropping to fifth, behind teammate Kubica.\nMassa, for his part, didn't pit until the 29th of 58 laps, giving away a one-stop strategy to make up for the lost time. Button's miserable weekend continued in the meantime, with the Honda man being awarded a drive-through penalty for pitlane speeding. On the same lap, American Scott Speed, who ran as high as 17th, had to park his Toro Rosso after an off due to tire problems.\nEight laps later, Kubica's fine run came to an end when he drove his BMW into the garage with gearbox problems, an issue that had plagued the Swiss-German team all through winter testing.\nAnother top-team newbie wasn't having as much of a stellar run: after a couple of brief offs, Renault's Heikki Kovalainen spun but managed to rejoin on lap 41.\nAlso spinning on lap 44, when the second round of pit stops was under way, was local favorite Mark Webber, who managed the feat while entering the pits. The Australian lost time, but was able to continue unscathed. Ditto for Raikkonen, whose tranquil run was spiced up by a small off-road excursion on lap 47.\nThe second round of pits produced the final main change in the order, as Alonso was able to emerge of the boxes ahead of Hamilton to gain P2. From then on, the only piece of headlining action came from a dive-bomb move by Red Bull's David Coulthard on Alex Wurz's Williams on lap 51 in a fight for the 13th spot. The Scot's overly optimistic maneuver on the inside caused both cars to touch wheels, launching DC's RB3, which just barely missed running over Wurz's helmet. Both men retired at the spot.\nSeven laps later, Raikkonen crossed the finish line for his first win since 2005. Heidfeld rallied to finish fourth, ahead of Fisichella, who fended off a last-gasp attack by Massa, the Brazilian's one-stop strategy paying off with a P6 finish. Williams' Nico Rosberg and Ralf Schumacher in the Toyota took the remaining Australian GP points.\n\"It wasn't as easy as it seemed, but we had a plan and followed it,\" Raikkonen said. \"\" We pushed hard on the opening laps and the car was perfect all day long. It's an excellent start to our season.\"\nDespite the defeat, Alonso was upbeat with the eight points hauled from Albert Park: \"We need to work harder if we are to win races, but we made the max out of the circumstances,\" the Spaniard felt. \"I had to focus on Heidfeld at the start and left room for Lewis to go, and that cost us. But it was a good fight.\"\nAn elated Hamilton, the first black driver to achieve the pinnacle of motorsport, celebrated a debut that, a couple of minor offs during the race aside, was nearly impeccable: \"Leading was fantastic, a fantastic feeling really. It was tough to have the champion behind me, but the team did an incredible job getting the car ready in the off-season. I don't know what happened on the second stop, I felt like it was a good stop, but in all it was a great experience.\"\nThe 2007 Formula 1 season resumes in three weeks' time with the Malaysian GP.

{"id": "7", "text": "How to find the right plan to fit your budget\nIt’s always a good idea to have dental insurance. Maintaining good oral health impacts your body’s overall health, so it’s important to know you can regularly access dental health services that are covered by a good insurance plan.\nLike any service or product, though, there are many options to choose from in the marketplace and it can be tricky to know which dental benefits plan is best for you. A good place to start is understanding the basics of dental insurance.\nDetermine your dental care needs\nThe first consideration is to determine your needs. If you are single and younger in age, the best dental plan for you will differ from that of a married couple with several children.\nCost of the dental insurance plan you choose will be determined by the type of plan that is chosen. While premiums for dental insurance are generally lower compared to conventional health insurance, dental plans generally cover 80% of costs on basic procedures such as treating cavities, removing teeth, and root canals. More serious procedures such as crowns and treatment of gum disease may only have 50% of costs covered.\nMost plans do cover 100% of preventative procedures such as teeth cleanings and X-rays.\nThree Types of Dental Insurance Plans\n- Indemnity or fee-for-service plans are generally the most expensive type of coverage. They will offer the largest network of dental providers to choose from and insurers will generally put a cap on the costs they’ll cover for certain procedures. Additionally, it’s not uncommon for the patient to pay the entire cost for a procedure and then file a claim with the insurer, which will provide reimbursement upon approval of the claim.\n- Preferred provider organizations (PPO) are one of the most common types of plans available and feature a network of dentists who negotiate fees with the insurer, resulting in lower out-of-pocket fees for the patient. Patients are able to use a dentist outside of the established network of providers, but there is usually a higher cost.\n- Health maintenance organizations (HMO) are similar to PPOs in that dentists join a network of providers to provide services at reduced costs. However, in an HMO the networks are usually much smaller within a constrained geographic footprint. In some cases, there may be out-of-network services these plans will allow you to access at a reduced cost. While these are generally the cheapest dental insurance plans available, they are also the most limited.\nAccessing dental insurance plans\nMost people have access to dental insurance through their employer, however, insurance can also be secured through group coverage programs that might include the Affordable Care Act Marketplace or government programs such as Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP).\nThe alternative to group coverage plans is purchasing an individual plan, which can be more expensive. These plans can also be more limited in the type of procedures that are covered and there’s sometimes a waiting period of anywhere between a few months to a year before major procedures will be covered.\nWhen considering an individual dental plan, it may also be worth implementing a Health Savings Account (HSA), which can be used to set aside funds to cover costs of procedures that the plan may not cover.\nRegardless of the dental insurance plan chosen, it is important to check on whether it is accepted by your dentist. If the plan is an HMO or PPO, it’s also important to determine if the dentist is within the network of those plans.\nAssociated Dentists is Here to Help\nIf you need any assistance understanding your dental insurance benefits or would like to inform us of any changes to your coverage, reach out to our in-house insurance department at our Madison and Verona locations.", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}

Presto - Andante amabile e con moto - Tempo l\nВремя создания: апрель-июнь 1824 года.\nAnatol Ugorski, фортепиано\nThe summer of 1822 proved to be extremely difficult for Beethoven financially. The costs for the upkeep of his nephew and servants as well as his household were high. His health was bad, so doctors' costs and a forthcoming stay in a spa consumed additional amounts of money. On top of this he had old debts with the publisher Steiner, who now demanded their repayment including interest. Beethoven had also incurred debts with his friend Franz Brentano in Frankfurt, as he had paid him an advance for acting as an agent for the Missa solemnis (which was neither finished nor even sold), as well as with the publisher Artaria in Vienna. In desperation the composer turned to his brother Johann. Johann van Beethoven, the family?s \"financial genius\" who was wealthy and very skilled in business matters, came to Ludwig's aid. He gave him cash and obviously stood security for him with Steiner, so that in the end Beethoven owed Johann 500 florins. But Johann van Beethoven was not wealthy because he was a sentimental businessman. And he knew his brother and his promises. Unlike publishers and friends he did not heed Ludwig's assurances but instead demanded copyright for several of his works, including the Bagatelles which Beethoven wanted to sell to the publisher Peters and which were later to become op. 119. As a result the unavoidable occurred: the brothers argued and had it out through different publishers. Johann tried to sell the Bagatelles, Ludwig tried to prevent this as he thought his brother was cheating him. Schemes and plots abounded, supposed intrigues were uncovered and hatched anew. Ludwig won: via his former pupil Ferdinand Ries, who lived in London, he sold the Bagatelles op. 119 to an English publisher. Once published they no longer had any business value for Johann. He did not, however, give up. To compensate Johann for the lost money, Ludwig had to provide a replacement. As he did not have any money, he provided compensation in the form of a new cycle of six Bagatelles op. 126, which he composed in spring 1824. On 19 June 1824 he told his brother that they were ready for collection.\nThis is the last and probably finest of the three sets of Bagatelles Beethoven wrote. In general, the six works comprising the collection are not as light as those in the earlier sets and the three lone Bagatelles without opus numbers. That said, the opening piece in Op. 126 is decidedly pleasant and light. Marked Andante con moto, it is a mostly serene work whose joyous main theme exudes a sense of self-confidence. Textures lighten in the latter part of the work, as the music takes on an almost angelic glow, heralding the incandescent close of the composer's last piano sonata. The Bagatelle No. 2 in G minor contrasts with the opening work in both its livelier Allegro tempo and somewhat anxious mood. Still, the ambivalent main theme here never tilts toward the dark side in its mixture of the stormy and playful, of the anxious and the delicate. The Bagatelle No. 3 in E flat major, marked Andante, is tranquil in its serenity and grandeur, its theme noble and clearly looking toward the nascent Romantic movement. Does this work augur the mood, perhaps even the keyboard writing, in the middle movement of Brahms' Piano Concerto No. 1? The Bagatelle No. 4 in B minor is a Presto filled with angst in its driving rhythms and heroic, stormy main theme. An alternate melody in the upper register, also lively and energetic, exhibits a measure of calm and gracefulness, and on its second appearance closes out this anxious piece in a relatively subdued mood. The G major No. 5, marked Quasi Allegretto, provides stark contrast to the preceding Bagatelle in its serene, dreamy, and consistently gentle manner. While it offers few technical challenges to the pianist, it will present sufficient interpretive ones. The concluding Bagatelle in E flat major is marked Presto -- Andante amabile e con moto, and begins with a surge of swirling currents that quickly turn tame for the introduction of the dreamy main theme. The music gradually becomes more animated, prodded by elements from the opening, and the theme exhibits a deeper expressive manner in its mixture of heroism and serenity. The opening surge mischievously returns to close out this masterpiece.\n(Robert Cummings, Rovi)", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}

Gone are the days when bras were just one-size-fits-all and shopping for the right bra was a nightmare task. Now, with the dawn of online shopping, finding a fitting bra for your body type is more convenient and hassle-free than ever before.\nBut how does one determine the right type of bras for their body type? Of course, the first step is to ask yourself question: Am I a plus size, petite, full-figured, or small-breasted woman? And once you’ve established which category you fall into, then you can move onto the next step – shopping for bras!\nThere are bras for every body type from petite to plus size, full-figured to small-breasted. When it comes to online shopping, the options are even better. Online stores offer larger range of sizes than traditional stores. They also carry a more diverse selection of styles and fits and can also help you find the best bras for your body type and give you advice on which fits and fabrics are best for you.\nOnline shopping makes it easy to try on bras without a lot of embarrassment or hassle. You can take your time and go through different styles and sizes to find the one that fits you perfectly. Most sites offer free shipping and returns, so you won’t be stuck with a bra that doesn’t fit. Plus, you can take advantage of online discounts and coupons to get even better deals.\nWhen it comes to full-figured women, fitting a bra properly is especially important. The wrong fit can lead to spillage and discomfort due to straps or not enough support. Going for full-figured bras that feature unique details like wider straps and more structured frames can help provide a great fit and support. Leading retailers make sure to provide bras for full-figured women that flatter their curves while providing the support they need.\nFor small-breasted women, bras with lightweight fabrics that offer minimal support are best. These bras provide just enough coverage without being bulky. They also look great under clothes and won’t make the wearer feel under-supported or uncomfortable. Going for lighter fabrics with delicate details and light padding can help make bigger breasts appear smaller, while adjustable straps can help customize the fit.\nPlus size women have unique needs when it comes to finding the right bra fit. Going for styles that offer firm support and are designed to keep your chest secure and comfortable are must. Plus size bras are usually more structured in order to ensure the bra’s framework provides the necessary support.\nFull-figured and plus-sized women have the additional advantage of finding bras that are designed with lacy details, unique colors, or sexy satin styles that provide a sense of glamour and confidence-boosting effect.\nWhen it comes to petite women, finding bras that fit is equally as important. But, petite bras usually feature thinner straps, less padding, and a shallow neckline in comparison to other sizes. Hosiery and lightweight fabrics are commonly used for a comfortable and snug fit. Petite bras also come in various colors and patterns that are designed to fit smaller frames without sacrificing style.\nShopping for bras can be a complicated and daunting endeavor, but with the help of online shopping, you can find the perfect bras for your body type. Take advantage of the comprehensive selection and information that online stores offer to ensure you get the best fit.", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

{"id": "50", "text": "Healing is an often neglected part of Fortnite strategy. In the rush to load up on the best gear possible while looting, players often settle for a full shield and one healing item to fall back on. However, healing in Fortnite Season 9 is just as important as any other aspect. Great aim and fast building will help you, but you’ve got to be able to recover from mistakes. This guide will run you through which healing items you should be going for and how to use your healing in more creative ways.\nHealing doesn’t have to just be for getting yourself out of a bad situation. Healing can actively form a part of your strategy, with the right healing set up and some good timing, you can actually use it to allow you to play more recklessly. Pro players often heal up multiple times per game, the confidence of having a fall-back helps them make bigger plays.\nMost players just focus on getting a full shield at the beginning of the game. This is your first healing concern. Following that, you need one of your inventory slots to be taken up by something to use to heal. You won’t typically need to carry more than this since eliminations should give you healing items or add some health on via the siphon. However, if you do keep an extra slot open, you can exploit the late game storms using healing items to stay ahead of the curve.\nHealing Your Shield\nShields are vital for staying alive during interactions with other players. Your options for getting a full shield are limited to:\n- Small Shield –These drop in stacks of three. Each takes only two seconds to drink and gives you 25 shield. These can’t be used to raise your shield above 50.\n- Large Shield –Drop in stacks of one and take five seconds to drink. Each gives you 50 shield.\n- Chug Jug –This is a huge healing item that takes the whole of fifteen seconds to consume These are pretty hard to find but will heal your health and shield fully.\n- Slurp Juice –This heals you up to a full shield if necessary. It grants one extra shield every 0.5 seconds up to 75 if you have the space for it.\n- Chug Splash –This is a new item added to the game that gives you 25 shield per splash. It is used almost instantly by throwing it like a grenade.\nOnce you’ve acquired your full shield, an item like a slurp juice or chug jug can really help you out later in the game. Don’t bother with small shields after the opening of a game. Large shields aren’t even particularly viable when there are better items out there. Chug Splashes can also be really helpful when you need to heal in a hurry. Since they can stack in 6s, a pile of these is going to be the best healing option if it is a little hard to find.\nIf you can find a Slurp Juice or Chug Jug, these are the better choices. Most players will carry some shields, so if you have to prioritise then you should avoid carrying standard shield potions over a med kit.\nAs well as your shield potions, you need equipment to heal your HP. Your options are a bit more limited for HP. However, many of the better choices overlap with shield healing.\n- Bandages – The most common healing item and also kind of useless. It heals you by 15 HP up to 75 HP, it takes 3.5 seconds to use and can stack up to 15. It is quick and efficient, but without healing you up all the way it is less than ideal.\n- Medkit –Slightly less common than the bandages but a lot more useful. This heals your health to 100 no matter how damaged you are. It takes 10 seconds to work and you can carry up to a stack of 3.\n- Cosy Campfire –This is an item you can place on the ground to heal when you’re stood by it. It heals you for up to 50 HP, adding 2 points every second. It can run for up to 25 seconds and be carried in a stack of any size.\n- Chug Splash – This item will give you 25 HP points per splash. It works the same as healing your shield just for HP.\n- Slurp Juice –This also works the same as when used for the shield.\nWhat Healing Items Should You Loot?\nWhen choosing which HP items to go for, there’s a clear winner. Of course, the Medkit is the most useful healing item. However, it can be impractical. The Slurp Juice can provide incremental healing that is invaluable in late-game situations, but a Medkit can get you out of nearly every bad situation. If you’re carrying an HP item to rely on, go for the Medkit if you can find one.\nThe cosy Campfire is really useful for team games. If you’re playing as a Squad or Duo, it is important that one of your team finds one of these to heal everyone up later in the game. The Chug Splash is also effective here. If you manage to find enough Chug Splashes, they are a great way to heal shield or HP for a team or Solo player.\nHealing in The Storm\nHealing helps you out when an encounter goes wrong but it also can be used to ride out the storm. Most players with a decent skill level probably don’t care about the storm anymore. They can easily outrun it and rarely pay much attention to it. However, with the right healing items, you can sustain yourself in the storm, which can be an effective tactic when you’re in the end game of a Fortnite match.\nUsing Medkits with the right timing when combined with a Slurp Juice or a Cosy Campfire can allow you to stay alive in the storm for quite a bit longer than you should be able to. In a close game, this strategy could let you clinch first place when the storm finishes off the Island. If you’re grinding for Hype points, keeping yourself alive in the storm can make all the difference.\nHealing in Fortnite isn’t too complicated but players who neglect it will lose matches that they could have won. Carrying the right healing items is important for staying alive in Fortnite. However, so is aiming properly and actually getting some kills. Once you’ve stocked up on the right healing items, you also need to make sure you’re running the best settings to get the highest frames per second in Fortnite.", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}
{"id": "51", "text": "Heated Mattress Pads: The Benefits, How They Work, And More\nAfter a long day, there is nothing better than crawling into a warm bed. But what if your bed was always warm? A heated mattress pad can give you the extra warmth you need to get a good night’s sleep.\nWhat are the benefits of using a heated mattress pad\nIf you’re like most people, you spend about one-third of your life asleep. So it’s important to make sure you’re as comfortable as possible when you hit the hay. Otherwise, you might find yourself tossing and turning all night long.\nOne way to ensure a good night’s sleep is to invest in a heated mattress pad. Here are four benefits of using one:\n1. They can help relieve pain.\nIf you suffer from muscle aches or arthritis, a heated mattress pad can help soothe your pains and allow you to get a restful night’s sleep. The heat can also help increase blood flow to the affected areas, which can speed up the healing process.\n2. They can improve circulation.\nPoor circulation can lead to a number of health problems, including cold feet and hands, numbness, and swelling. A heated mattress pad can help improve circulation by dilating blood vessels and expanding capillaries. This, in turn, can reduce the risk of those problems.\n3. They can ease respiratory problems.\nIf you have asthma or allergies, a heated mattress pad can help clear your nasal passages and ease your breathing. The heat can also help relieve congestion by thinning out mucus.\n4. They can boost your immune system.\nThe heat produced by a heated mattress pad can help kill bacteria and viruses, which means it can actually help you fight off illnesses. In fact, one study found that using a heating pad increased white blood cell production in people with arthritis.\nHow does a heated mattress pad work\nA heated mattress pad is a bedding accessory that can be placed on top of a mattress to provide warmth. Most heated mattress pads have multiple heat settings so that users can find the perfect level of warmth for their needs. Some even come with timers so that the heating element will automatically turn off after a certain amount of time, helping to prevent accidental fires.\nWhat are the different settings on a heated mattress pad\nThere are many different settings on a heated mattress pad. The most common settings are low, medium, and high. Low is typically used for sleeping, as it will not cause you to sweat. Medium is usually used for people who have aches and pains, as it can help to relieve them. High is typically used for people who are cold, as it will raise your body temperature.\nIs a heated mattress pad safe to use\nA heated mattress pad is a great way to stay warm and comfortable during the colder months. However, there are a few safety concerns that you should be aware of before using one.\nHeated mattress pads can pose a fire risk if they are not used properly. Make sure to follow the manufacturer’s instructions carefully and never leave the pad unattended while it is on. Also, be sure to place the pad on a fire-resistant surface such as a sheet of plywood.\nIf you have any medical conditions that affect your circulation or temperature sensitivity, you should check with your doctor before using a heated mattress pad. Otherwise, enjoy the extra warmth and comfort!\nHow long does it take for a heated mattress pad to heat up\nMost heated mattress pads will heat up within ten minutes or less. Some models may have a preheat feature that will allow you to warm up the bed before you get in it. It is important to read the manufacturer’s instructions before using this feature, as some models require that you turn off the preheat function once the bed is warmed up, while others will automatically turn off after a set amount of time.\nHow much does a heated mattress pad cost\nIf you’re looking for a way to keep your bed warm and cozy all winter long, a heated mattress pad is a great option. But how much does one cost?\nPrices for heated mattress pads can vary depending on the size, features, and brand. A basic twin-size heated mattress pad can start at around $30, while a more deluxe king-size model can cost upwards of $200.\nSome features that can affect the price include multiple heat settings, automatic shut-off, and a preheat function. If you live in a particularly cold climate or tend to get chilly at night, spending a bit more on a higher-end model may be worth it.\nNo matter what your budget is, there’s a heated mattress pad out there that will suit your needs. So don’t let the cold weather keep you from getting a good night’s sleep – snuggle up with a heated mattress pad and stay nice and toasty all winter long!\nCan a heated mattress pad be used on any bed\nIf you’re looking for a way to add a little extra warmth to your bed, a heated mattress pad is a great option. But can a heated mattress pad be used on any bed? The answer is yes! Heated mattress pads are designed to fit all standard mattresses, so you can use one on any bed in your home. Just make sure to follow the manufacturer’s instructions for safe use.\nWhat is the warranty on a heated mattress pad\nHeated mattress pads are a great way to keep warm in bed during the colder months. But what happens if your heated mattress pad stops working? Most heated mattress pads come with a one-year warranty, so you should be covered if something goes wrong. However, it’s always a good idea to check with the manufacturer before you make a purchase to see what their warranty policy is. That way, you’ll know exactly what you’re getting into before you buy.\nHow do I clean a heated mattress pad\nHeated mattress pads are a great way to keep your bed warm and cozy all winter long. But as with any bedding, they need to be cleaned periodically to prevent build-up of dirt, dust, and other allergens. Here are some tips for cleaning your heated mattress pad:\n1. Unplug the mattress pad and remove it from the bed.\n2. Vacuum the mattress pad with a handheld vacuum or the attachment of your regular vacuum cleaner. Pay special attention to the seams and crevices, where dirt and dust tend to accumulate.\n3. If there are any stains on the mattress pad, treat them with a mild stain remover before washing.\n4. Wash the mattress pad in your washing machine using warm water and a gentle detergent.\n5. Hang the mattress pad to dry, or put it in the dryer on low heat.\n6. Once the mattress pad is completely dry, plug it in and put it back on the bed. Enjoy your cozy, warm bed!\nWhere can I buy a heated mattress pad\nThere are a few places you can buy a heated mattress pad. Some stores that sell bedding, such as Bed, Bath & Beyond, Macy’s, and Target, sell them. You can also buy them online at Amazon.com and Walmart.com. Heated mattress pads come in different sizes and prices, so it is important to find one that fits your budget and needs.", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

{"id": "53", "text": "The medieval enchantment of Crystal Ball is brought to life using clear no-nonsense graphics and well sized symbols. The base game has a simple set up with the action taking place in the dark and murky wooded area outside the wizard’s mansion. In the free games, the game is given an orange background glow and the sound effects intensify, to add to the suspense and enjoyment of the free game play.\nThe game’s theme also extends to the symbols on the reels. There are four higher value theme related symbols including the wizard, a bottled magic green potion, a unicorn and a chain pendant holding a blue gem. The lower value symbols are represented by the royals A, J, K, Q and 10. The crystal ball itself acts as a wild and scatter symbol, which is where the slot takes its name from.\nIn addition to being the wild symbol, the crystal ball can also act as a scatter symbol and it provides the opportunity to win 10 free games. The crystal ball will award a scatter payment when at least three of them land anywhere on the reels. When this occurs ten free games are activated. Once the free game bonus is triggered a bonus symbol is automatically selected before the free games can commence. The bonus symbol can be any symbol except the crystal ball. The free games continue with the same playing concept; however, if the bonus symbol lands on any two or more reels, a payline win is awarded even if the symbols are not adjacent to one another along a payline.\nUpon landing a win, players have the choice of two gamble features that can be used to try to increase the winnings. These options will automatically appear below the reels on the right-hand side of the display screen. The two options are the ‘Ladder Gamble’ and the ‘Card Gamble’.\nThe Ladder gamble option is accessed by pressing the button with the ladder symbol. Each upward step of the ladder represents a higher value win. Players have the chance to work their way up each rung of the ladder and increase the winnings as they go. However, if the gamble is unsuccessful it can lead to a partial or total loss of the initial win. The ladder gamble will highlight the value of the potential win or loss during each particular turn. There is also an option after the base game win, and each successful gamble thereafter, to collect half of the gamble win and continue to gamble with the remaining amount, which is perfect for those who want to reduce the risk.\nThe card gamble is entered via the button with the card symbol. Again, you have the chance to increase your win only this time the gamble is placed on guessing the colour of the face down card at the top of the pack. After picking a colour, the top card is revealed and if players have chosen correctly then the payout is doubled. Selecting the wrong colour results in the gamble being fully lost. Similar to the Ladder gamble, there is an option to collect half of the win or gamble win and then continue to gamble with the remainder.\nCrystal Ball slot is a high volatility game and it has an RTP of 96.12%, which is slightly above average for online slots. Low volatility slots pay out small amounts regularly, whereas high volatility slots pay out large amounts less frequently. As such, players may have to play several spins of this slot before they see a return.\nThe slot has a top standard payout of 1000x that is won by landing five wizards along a payline. The unicorn can payout up too 400x, the green bottled potion and blue gem pendant payout up too 150x while the royals payout between 20x and 30x. Of course, with the aid of the gamble feature, it is possible to win far more than this from a single spin.\nHow to Play\nCrystal Ball is an easy to play slot. Before spinning the reels, all the player needs to do is set his/her total bet per spin using the buttons beneath the reels. The total bet should be divided by 20 to calculate the individual payline bet. All the player then needs to do is click on the spin button. There is also auto play functionality that can be used to set up to 100 spins in motion complete with win and loss limits.", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

If any man walk in the day he stumbleth not, because he seeth the light of this world.\n10 But if a man walk in the night, he stumbleth because there is no light in him.”\n11 These things said He, and after that He said unto them, “Our friend Lazarus sleepeth; but I go, that I may awaken him out of sleep.”\n12 Then said His disciples, “Lord, if he sleep he shall do well.”\n13 However Jesus spoke of his death, but they thought that He had spoken of the taking of rest in sleep.\n14 Then Jesus said unto them plainly, “Lazarus is dead.\n15 And I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, to the intent that ye may believe. Nevertheless let us go unto him.”\n16 Then Thomas, who was called Didymus, said unto his fellow disciples, “Let us also go, that we may die with Him.”\n17 Then when Jesus came, He found that he had lain in the grave four days already.\n18 Now Bethany was nigh unto Jerusalem, about two miles away,\n19 and many of the Jews came to Martha and Mary to comfort them concerning their brother.\n20 Then Martha, as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming, went and met Him; but Mary sat still in the house.\n21 Then Martha said unto Jesus, “Lord, if Thou hadst been here, my brother would not have died.\n22 But I know that even now, whatsoever Thou wilt ask of God, God will give it Thee.”\n23 Jesus said unto her, “Thy brother shall rise again.”\n24 Martha said unto Him, “I know that he shall rise again at the resurrection on the Last Day.”\n25 Jesus said unto her, “I am the resurrection and the Life. He that believeth in Me, though he were dead, yet shall he live;\n26 and whosoever liveth and believeth in Me shall never die. Believest thou this?”\n27 She said unto Him, “Yea, Lord, I believe that Thou art the Christ, the Son of God, who should come into the world.”\n28 And when she had so said, she went her way and called Mary her sister secretly, saying, “The Master has come, and calleth for thee.”\n29 As soon as she heard that, she arose quickly and came unto Him.\n30 Now Jesus had not yet come into the town, but was in that place where Martha met Him.\n31 The Jews then, who were with her in the house and comforting her, when they saw that Mary rose up hastily and went out, followed her, saying, “She goeth unto the grave to weep there.”\n32 Then when Mary had come where Jesus was and saw Him, she fell down at His feet, saying unto Him, “Lord, if Thou hadst been here, my brother would not have died.”\n33 When Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews also weeping who came with her, He groaned in the spirit and was troubled,\n34 and said, “Where have ye laid him?” They said unto Him, “Lord, come and see.”\n35 Jesus wept.\n36 Then said the Jews, “Behold, how he loved him!”\n37 And some of them said, “Could not this man, who opened the eyes of the blind, have caused that even this man should not have died?”\n38 Jesus therefore again, groaning in Himself, came to the grave. It was a cave, and a stone lay against it.\n39 Jesus said, “Take ye away the stone.” Martha, the sister of him that was dead, said unto Him, “Lord, by this time there is a stench, for he hath been dead four days.”\n40 Jesus said unto her, “Said I not unto thee that if thou would believe, thou should see the glory of God?”\n41 Then they took away the stone from the place where the dead was laid. And Jesus lifted up His eyes and said, “Father, I thank Thee that Thou hast heard Me.\n42 And I knew that Thou hearest Me always, but because of the people who stand by I said it, that they may believe that Thou hast sent Me.”\n43 And when He thus had spoken, He cried with a loud voice, “Lazarus, come forth!”\n44 And he that was dead came forth, bound hand and foot with graveclothes, and his face was bound about with a napkin. Jesus said unto them, “Loose him, and let him go.”\n45 Then many of the Jews who came to Mary and had seen the things which Jesus did, believed in Him.\n46 But some of them went their ways to the Pharisees, and told them what things Jesus had done.\n47 Then gathered the chief priests and the Pharisees a council and said, “What shall we do? For this man doeth many miracles.\n48 If we let him thus alone, all men will believe in him, and the Romans shall come and take away both our place and nation.”\n49 And one of them named Caiaphas, being the high priest that same year, said unto them, “Ye know nothing at all,\n50 nor consider that it is expedient for us that one man should die for the people, and that the whole nation perish not.”\n51 And he spoke this not of himself, but, being high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus should die for that nation;\n52 and not for that nation only, but that also He should gather together in one the children of God who were scattered abroad.\n53 So from that day forth, they took counsel together to put Him to death.\n54 Jesus therefore walked no longer openly among the Jews, but went thence unto a region near the wilderness into a city called Ephraim, and there continued with His disciples.\n55 And the Jews’ Passover was nigh at hand, and many went out of the country up to Jerusalem before the Passover to purify themselves.\n56 Then they sought for Jesus and spoke among themselves as they stood in the temple, saying, “What think ye — that he will not come to the feast?”\n57 Now both the chief priests and the Pharisees had given a command that if any man knew where He was, he should report it, that they might take Him.", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}
{"id": "59", "text": "Perhaps the most spectacular of all Greek vases, the Sarpedon krater depicts the body of Sarpedon, a hero of the Trojan War, being carried away to his homeland for burial. It was decorated some 2,500 years ago by Athenian artist Euphronios, and its subsequent history involves tomb raiding, intrigue, duplicity, litigation, international outrage, and possibly even homicide. How this came about is told by Nigel Spivey in a concise, stylish book that braids together the creation and adventures of this extraordinary object with an exploration of its abiding influence.\nSpivey takes the reader on a dramatic journey, beginning with the krater’s looting from an Etruscan tomb in 1971 and its acquisition by the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, followed by a high-profile lawsuit over its status and its eventual return to Italy. He explains where, how, and why the vase was produced, retrieving what we know about the life and legend of Sarpedon. Spivey also pursues the figural motif of the slain Sarpedon portrayed on the vase and traces how this motif became a standard way of representing the dead and dying in Western art, especially during the Renaissance.\nFascinating and informative, The Sarpedon Krater is a multifaceted introduction to the enduring influence of Greek art on the world.", "scores": {"score": 3, "score_transform_1": 5, "score_transform_2": 5, "score_transform_3": 0}}
{"id": "60", "text": "Milling around the Monster Stage at the start of Slam Dunk 2015, the crowd enjoys a sudden burst of glaring sunshine, after cloudy skies have threatened rain all morning. It’s clear that this is a festival with its own unique feel – there’s a real sense of family at Slam Dunk. The genres vary, and not everyone will agree on the acts performing here today, but there’s a level of respect among the bands.\nFirst up is The Colour Morale. It could’ve been the Desperados samples quickly necked to make the set, but three songs in I’m so impressed I order a t-shirt from their merch site there and then. This band should be more than an opening act – energy, showmanship and talent on display from start to finish.\nNext on the radar are Beartooth, hugely hyped. The crowd expect big things. Unfortunately Beartooth don’t deliver. Maybe it’s all the talk, but the American metalcore outfit live lack the raw emotion and energy found on their record. A disappointment – but the next act can’t possibly disappoint.\nMarachi El Bronx are something a bit different to break up the day: a fun band, a great crowd, smiles all round and a brilliant atmosphere. Definitely a band to see live, they have an individual sound and their good time feels are infectious.\nLate in the day and eager to experience the full force of this rock festival we head back to the Monster Stage for Crossfaith. There are a lot of bands out there boasting a “brutal” mosh pit but going front centre for a Crossfaith show really is a calculated risk. This band knows how to work a crowd without any frontman stunts – everything about them is real and raw. After a blinding set we are left sweaty, disoriented and wondering what the hell has just happened. Crossfaith chew us up and spit us out – and it was awesome.\nPhotos: Scott Wight\nNext up, Finch, a childhood favourite for about 90 per cent of the festivalgoers, if not for me. Nate Barcalow rattles out some of the best screams of the day, followed by some of the most powerful cleans we’ve heard. It’s a rarity to find these two talents in one man, and I, for one, will be rooting for their big comeback.\nOver to the main stage, outdoors in Leeds’ Millennium Square, to see the now veteran rockers Taking Back Sunday. Hit and miss in the past, they are absolutely on form for Slam Dunk’s tenth anniversary. Adam Lazarra displays great vocals and serious fitness, bouncing around the stage, delivering the passionate performance expected of the main support. Deserving of their spot on the day, TBS give a stomping performance.\nWe’re sunburnt, bruised and slightly squiffy, and it’s time for the headline act. But with brilliant bands conflicting there are some deep and meaningful discussions among the crowds about which to see. But with the rumours of a certain act going back to their roots in their setlist, for me at least it’s an obvious choice.\nOpening with The Truth Is A Terrible Thing – their first performance of it in five years – You Me At Six immediately put the rumours to rest. They dive straight into Save It For The Bedroom and the crowd completely loses it. This is only the beginning. We are treated to vintage gems like Jealous Minds Think Alike, Take Off Your Colours, The Rumour and Always Attract – none of which have been played for two years or more.\nThese, along with crowd favourites Stay With Me, Reckless and Loverboy, demonstrate their impressive canon and their ability to stay current and interesting for fans of all ages, backgrounds and tastes. With a powerful performance from every band member YMAS are a force to be reckoned with. A deserved main stage headliner at any festival but never more at home than at Slam Dunk.\nSlam Dunk 2015, Millennium Square, Leeds, 23 May", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

{"id": "78", "text": "Why Is There So Much To Football I Hate??\nPosted on May 19, 2010\nBit of a blog delay here, I have been away on a short, but lovely break in the Herefordshire Countryside, it was a cracking weekend with great company, great food, and great wine.\nHowever this didn’t stop me watching two live football matches over the weekend, the first time I have done this in years, firstly the Cup Final on Saturday, then the Division One play off semi final on Monday night.\nI used to love football, and I still believe that a thrilling game of football is more exciting than any other sport, the tribal instinct that comes out of players and fans in games such as the Germany v England World Cup Semi Final in 1990 cannot be matched by anything else in my opinion. England’s 2005 Ashes series victory, and the last gasp win against Australia in the 2003 Rugby World Cup were epic sporting occasions, but nothing touches football for the intensity of the rivalry, so what a shame it is that it is packed full of utter pricks at all levels.\nFrom Lord Triesman claiming that Jonny Foreigner (Spain and Russia) is about to bribe Refs at the 2010 World Cup, to gum chewing snarling dictator Alex Ferguson, right through to badge kissing players, and fat fans crying for the Sky cameras after relegation, there is so much to hate about football.\nChelsea are top of my hate list, they have so many players that are just peasants who have come in to cash, they snarl, they rip their shirts off and puff their waxed chests out, they kiss their club badge whilst refusing to sign a new contract unless there is another 30k a week on the table, and yet there is still something far worse than any of this. PRETENDING TO ROCK A BABY AS A GOAL CELEBRATION FOR A WAG WHO HAS JUST GIVEN BIRTH AAAAAAAAAAAAAARGGGHHHH!!! The first act of the new parliament should have been to introduce the public flogging of footballers who carry out this sickening act.\nSome people would say that I am just jealous of the riches and celebrity these cunts (I am sorry I can’t just call them buggers) enjoy, but if that was the case why am I not jealous of Paul Scholes or Ryan Giggs for example? One presumes they are mega rich, but their conduct is a breath of fresh air to the rest. Roy Hodgson the Manager of Fulham is another example, you just can’t dislike him or his team. He is a strange loveable character talking like Harold Steptoe, and actually looking like someone from an early 1970’s Michael Caine film like the Italian job. Maybe it is an Ashes to Ashes remake; “My name is Roy Hodgson. In 1972 I was hit by a car, and now I am a manager of a Football club in 2010, is it a dream, or am I dead, and if I am alive, how do I get away from this fucking nonsense and back to my normal life.”\nImagine if next season started and Hodgson had just disappeared like he had never been there!\nHodgson: Time travel Ashes to Ashes style?\nI am just not excited about the World Cup like I have been in the past, but I guess I will get more in to it as it approaches, and maybe in between the diving, the cheating, and the exaggerated commentary whenever Christiano Ronaldo or Lionel Messi touch the ball, we might get some exciting football.\nIt is just a relief that John Terry has been stripped of the captaincy of England, it would be hard to feel pleased for him if a limited England side pulled out all the stops and won the World Cup in South Africa. I just can’t like the guy, or any of his Chelsea team mates. Part of me would rather see us not win it just to avoid the pain of seeing a pratt like of him parading around Trafalgar Square covered in tickertape.", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

{"id": "80", "text": "In Washington, divorcing parents have a handful of options when it comes to structuring custody and parenting time after their divorce. One of these options is to establish a joint custody arrangement. When divorced parents share joint custody, each parent spends an equal (or roughly equal) amount of time with their children. For example, they may alternate custody on a weekly basis, or they may agree to an alternate arrangement that better suits their respective work schedules while also serving the best interests of their children.\nWhile joint custody can be a good option under the right circumstances, it also inherently presents certain challenges for divorced parents. Divorced parents who share joint custody will need to continue to communicate, and they will need to be cooperative with one another in order to provide as much stability for their children as possible.\n7 Tips for Maintaining an Amicable Joint Custody Arrangement after Your Divorce\nIf you are considering a joint custody agreement, or if you currently have a joint custody agreement and are facing challenges in dealing with your former spouse, what can you do to make your parenting arrangement more amicable? Here are some tips from the custody lawyers at Bolan Law Group.:\nTip #1: Make Sure You Know the Terms of Your Joint Custody Agreement\nIn many cases, divorced parents run into issues because one or both of them have an inaccurate understanding of the terms of their joint custody agreement. In order to ensure that you are upholding your end of the deal – and to make sure you have a clear understanding of your former spouse’s obligations as well – it is important to carefully review the terms of your agreement.\nWhat does your joint custody agreement say about transportation? What does it say about pick-up and drop-off windows? What does it say about phone time, curfews, and other similar types of parenting issues? Before discussing issues or concerns with your former spouse, you will want to make sure you know exactly what your agreement says with regard to your respective rights and responsibilities.\nTip #2: Have a Plan for Communicating with Your Former Spouse\nIf you need to discuss an issue with your former spouse, make sure you have a plan for how and when you communicate your concerns. For example, firing off a text message during your former spouse’s parenting time might not be as effective as carefully writing an email or suggesting that you need to schedule a mutually convenient time to talk. Oftentimes, disputes become contentious not because of what is said, but because of how the message is conveyed. If you set the stage for an amicable discussion, you may be able to achieve a positive outcome without engendering unwarranted hostility.\nTip #3: Do Not Involve Your Children in Any Communications about Issues or Concerns\nAfter a divorce, it is not uncommon for parents to only come into contact when their children are present. However, if you have concerns that you need to address or issues that you need to resolve, it is very important that you communicate with your former spouse outside of your children’s presence. Divorced parents should not involve their children in custody disputes, as this can have negative psychological effects that endure long after the issue is resolved.\nIn this same vein, divorced parents should not ask their children to communicate messages for them, and they should not try to negatively influence their children’s perception of their other parent. Not only can these engender hostility between the parents and increase the likelihood of a contentious dispute, but they can have negative psychological effects for the children as well.\nTip #4: Consider What Constitutes an Appropriate Response\nWhile both parents should strictly adhere to the terms of their joint custody agreement, issues come up, and some grace is to be expected. If your former spouse is occasionally five minutes late dropping off your children, this is a very different matter from consistently “canceling” a pickup at the last minute.\nIn order to maintain a peaceful joint custody arrangement, it may be necessary to overlook the occasional minor transgression. On the other hand, this can also be a slippery slope, and you also need to know when to say when. If your former spouse is not complying with your joint custody agreement and you have questions about what you should do, you should speak with an attorney before making any significant decisions.\nTip #5: Seek Advice When Necessary\nTransitioning to life after divorce is not easy, and adjusting to a joint custody arrangement takes time. If you are struggling, if you have questions, or if you are feeling isolated or helpless, you should not hesitate to seek advice. A family attorney can help you with any legal issues related to your joint custody arrangement, and friends, family members, and support groups can provide you with practical advice. Psychologists, social workers, and other professionals can provide invaluable advice for post-divorce parenting as well.\nTip #6: Do Not Let Issues Linger\nIf you run into an issue with your former spouse, it is generally not a good idea to let the issue linger. While some issues will go away, many will not. Addressing the issue before it gets worse can increase your chances of finding an amicable solution and help you maintain a peaceful joint custody arrangement.\nTip #7: Seek a Modification If You Can No Longer Comply with Your Joint Custody Agreement\nFinally, if your circumstances change and you are no longer able to comply with your joint custody agreement, this is an issue that you will want to address proactively as well. Violating the terms if your agreement can have serious consequences, and it’s something that you want to avoid if at all possible.\nSpeak with a Custody Attorney at Bolan Law Group.\nDo you have questions about establishing joint custody or what to do if you encounter a custody-related issue after your divorce?

Forget those fleeting moments of doubt here for a moment, they are your flesh, your old nature trying to come up for air, forget the advances of Satanic forces whispering in your ear occasionally, answer the question, how is your faith in the Lord expressed not to the outside world, not to your spouse, children, friends or family, but in your heart?\n“Examine yourselves, whether ye be in the faith; prove your own selves. Know ye not your own selves, how that Jesus Christ is in you, except ye be reprobates?” (2nd Cor. 13:5)\nIt’s one or the other, not both, not saved sometimes and the other at other times not saved, it isn’t the foolishness of the Roman Catholic cult and their lie of the “sin of presumption,” it isn’t the Mormons with their works-based ideologies or any other sinful religious organization that should enter into your mind here, it is what does your heart tells you, the heart that the Lord looks at, how does it express the knowledge, the unquestionable fact that Jesus Christ is the Lord of your life, that you are going to heaven, that you will spend eternity in the presence of the joy of the Lord, experiencing pleasures forevermore?\nI hope you did not say, “It’s a feeling I have,” for that heart is deceitful continuously, and faith is not feeling saved, faith is the knowledge that you are saved.\nWhat does your heart say? I hope it’s not any external evidence that sways your heart, plenty of food and water, a warm comfortable place to rest you head at night, fairly good health, or any other item that coerces your heart, as long as those items remain.\nDo you believe your salvation is assured, beyond questioning, an absolute guarantee?\nI will offer you what I can, but it is not the answer of your heart necessarily, no matter the circumstances or the possible consequences to yourself, that’s the best I have for you. If your heart can say that, then there is a very good possibility that you are indeed saved. But I offer you now, at least in what I have been shown to write in this short letter, one simple verse that will prove to you where your heart truly is, where your faith truly lies.\nIf you read it and mean it, if your heart rejoices in it no matter where the Lord leads you for the glory of God, if you can honestly say Thy will be done when you read this verse, then rejoice greatly, for your rewards will be great, and you will stand in the presence of God Himself.

{"id": "84", "text": "The municipality will hear a delegation from Woodfibre LNG next month to discuss the liquefied natural gas facility being constructed outside Squamish.\nThe company requested a presentation at an upcoming council meeting to talk about the project, located at the site of the former Woodfibre pulp and paper mill southwest of the town. In a letter to Bowen Island Municipality the company says they’re “committed to contributing to a net-zero future, driven by innovation; ensuring meaningful reconciliation with Indigenous people; and providing positive socioeconomic benefits for Squamish and neighbouring communities, including Bowen Island.”\nThe multi-billion dollar facility being built on Howe Sound will employ about 100 workers and produce millions of tonnes of LNG a year once fully operational. Final cleanup is expected this year, with construction beginning in 2023 and an anticipated completion date of 2027.\n“2022 will be a milestone year for the company and we would appreciate the opportunity to provide a comprehensive update on our project to Bowen Island Mayor and Council,” wrote Julia Diamond, Woodfibre’s senior manager of government relations.\nBut not everybody was eager to roll out the welcome mat. “My first reaction to this letter was quite negative,” said Coun. Maureen Nicholson during the March 28 meeting. “The last time the LNG roadshow came to Bowen Island was – from my perspective – a particularly unpleasant visit.”\nBut Nicholson said after speaking with community members, “the response was basically, ‘bring it on’.”\n“People are interested in hearing what was happened in the 6.5-7 years since Woodfibre spoke with us. For the delegation, I hope there actually will be an opportunity for the public to put forward their questions,” said Nicholson.\nThe strongest opposition to the visit came from Coun. Sue Ellen Fast. “We need to spend our limited time at council meetings on significant business for our community, and not going over business that we’ve already made decisions about,” she said.\n“Since February 2015 council has been passing motions of non-support of that Woodfibre LNG proposal,” said Fast, pointing out as recently as two years ago council voted to “direct staff to communicate to the Provincial Environmental Assessment Office that Bowen Island Municipality continues to not support the Woodfibre LNG project.” (Councillors Michael Kaile and Alison Morse opposed this directive, according to the minutes for the May 25, 2020 meeting.)\n“So I think we should just receive the letter, but tell them we’ve done lots of work on it. They don’t need to take up our time at a council meeting about it,” continued Fast. “If they want to come and hold an open house or put an article in the Undercurrent, there’s lots of other venues.”\nBut consensus seemed to be hearing from the company was for the best.\n“I get Coun. Fast’s comments. On the flipside I think it’s important that we are in the loop and know what’s going on,” said Coun. Rob Wynen. “Even if we don’t support this project, I don’t see any reason why us knowing what is happening there is a hindrance.”\n“I know some people have had questions about that operation, and it would be a chance for us to ask those questions and clarify anything we want to clarify… I think we should be open minded,” added Morse.\nCouncil voted to have staff schedule a presentation date, with Fast the lone councillor in opposition.", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

These places know that you have a legal right to breastfeed anywhere but wish to create an environment that makes you feel welcomed and supported.\nThe Equality Act 2010\nThis Act states that it is sex discrimination to treat a woman unfavourably because she is breastfeeding. It applies to anyone providing services, benefits, facilities and premises to the public, public bodies, further and higher education bodies and associations.\nIf you are breastfeeding in a public place such as a café, park, shop, cinema,, on a bus etc, you cannot be asked to stop or refused to be served. You are also protected on public transport such as buses, trains and planes.\nWho has this award?\nThe list of Breastfeeding Friendly venues includes leisure centres, cafes, restaurants, libraries and play areas which all support breastfeeding in Sheffield. The venues usually display a window sticker showing the Breastfeeding Friendly sign.\nHave a look at the list of Sheffield Breastfeeding Friendly Venues 2023 to find places in each area of Sheffield.\nWould you like your venue to be Breastfeeding Friendly?\nHave a look at the Breastfeeding Friendly checklist to see whether your venue would be eligible for the Breastfeeding Friendly Award.\nWe would be happy to consider any business, community venue or service for the award, if it is somewhere that could be used by breastfeeding mums. If you are unsure what is involved, or would like to discuss it further, please contact us at Breastfeeding in Sheffield.\nTop Tips for Breastfeeding in Public\nHow do I avoid flashing my boobs?\nClothes that work:\n- Tops that unbutton from the bottom as they can be worn over vest tops\n- Stretchy tops, vests or cropped tops – can be layered up and pulled up or down.\n- You can buy clothes especially for breastfeeding but it isn’t always necessary. Have a look at the ‘Can I breastfeed in it?’ website for ideas and inspiration\n- Jackets, shirts over a vest top and cardigans can be used as screens and will cover almost everything!\n- Scarves are also good at keeping things under wraps.\n- Use a sling or a pouch – they make carrying the baby easier on your back and cover most of the boob as well. Contact one of Sheffield’s sling groups for advice on sling carrying and read our information on sling wearing, in the section ‘Keeping your baby Close’\nClothes that don’t work:\n- Shirts you have to unbutton from the top – make you feel really exposed.\n- Practice! The more you do it, the better you get at getting baby latched on quickly. You can do this without even leaving your living room.\n- Use your local breastfeeding support group to practice in front of other people.\n- Use the groups at your local Family Hub to meet other mums, Breastfeeding in Sheffield – Support Groups June-Sept 2023 (1)You can share advice and support each other.\n- It might be a big deal for you, but most people don’t even notice.\n- Remember why you’re doing it – for your baby!

Who cares what other people think?\n- Breastfeeding is an amazing achievement – be proud of it!\n- Share your experiences with other mums on the Breastfeeding in Sheffield Facebook page. It helps to hear how other parents have coped.\nTime and Place\n- Take a friend with you in the early days, until you feel more confident.\n- Try and get settled somewhere before your baby gets hungry.\n- Find a spot where you won’t be disturbed.

It says that it is sex discrimination to treat a woman unfavourably because she is breastfeeding.

You are also protected on public transport such as buses, trains and planes.\n- The law protects you for as long as you wish to breastfeed your baby.\n- Further and higher education bodies must not discriminate, harass or victimise a student who is breastfeeding in terms of admission or provision of education or by excluding the student.\n- An association is a club that has rules of membership and at least 25 T\nIf you are discriminated against, you should make a complaint to the organisation that has discriminated against you.

{"id": "87", "text": "A truly fascinating day. On several levels. Mostly with the extreme speed fish can vanish. It all began, with Jon...\n1st Sailing. and it took three moves, but then we found some consistent bass fishing. Quality schoolies. Some other threatening to push 2.5lb. But most importantly, plenty of action, which has been missing the past couple of sailings. So, there were big smiles. And also, the wind which began with stiff and particularly chilly gusts, backed down as the air warmed from an early sun ascending in a cloudless sky. A common phenomenon these past few days. Something to do with the difference between land and sea temperatures perhaps. Calmed enough, to consider the big bass bank.\n\"Jon, I know a place, where the bass don't get caught under 5lb\" I said. \"Righto\" he replied, with that cheeky smirk that suggests he thinks I am pulling his leg. \"You don't believe me do you? \" I enquired. \"Right... Reel up\" I passed him a heavier shad, and informed him we might get wet, as there was a bit of swell offshore.\nOn arrival. I gave Jon strict instruction. And then I watched, as he took 8 fish to my halfhearted take, on consecutive drifts to the end of the session. Amazing. If a little frustrating. Sadly 3-4lb stamp. No sign of those long lean ones from a week ago. Most importantly, for my client, very enjoyable fishing. The pure delight each time his rod bent over. Especially when mine did not... One very happy Jon left the boat, and happened to bump into my clients for the next session. Bubbling away, he explained to them about the 25 fish, and the excellent average size.\nShall I bother with writing the rest of this blog? As I am guessing you know where it is going. After really good action, I truly expected to pick up where I left off. But for Mark and Armando, it was simply a struggle. The wind had veered a little more easterly and increased, which restricted visiting the more deep marks. But nothing but a single schoolie for the entire session. The exact reverse of the 1st session. And I was very sad for the guys lack of action. But, they are seasoned BIF1 anglers, and have seen how it works.\nNext up, was Bruno returning for another go. He had a great session on his previous trip, with bream and bass, and had already been fishing on the marina with a couple of plaice to his credit already. This session was slightly less severe than the previous one. Bruno had a mackerel, and we found a couple of schoolies. We even popped out to the big fish place over the low tide, but with the new flood, the wind suddenly tracked SE and got up forcing us back to inshore. This wind now became a major feature, with some very strange swells created by the wind veering NE, then SE, and blowing hard.\nDespite all this, we fished on. And Bruno proved his patience warranted with a nice fish from a fairly inshore mark. But then nothing to the end of the session, despite really covering some reefs. Lots of bait fish showing on the sounder. But nothing interested to eat them. With the flood tide now pushing hard, the confused swell got worse. Combined with the poor fishing, I made the decision to cancel the final sailing.\nBut every day is different. Indeed, as has been proven time and time again,. every sailing is often very different. Seeing what the next day is going to bring, is a lot of the fun of the job for me.

So as we’re gifting treasures to our favorite people, we’re also creating an ugly amount of waste for our planet. It’s high time our thoughtfulness goes past what’s inside the box. Today, we’re teaming up with Allbirds and their #ScrapTheWrap campaign to bring you four charming, greener ways to wrap those gifts.\nThink outside of the box, y’all. Literally.\nAllbirds has long been a B+C favorite, and not just because of its cult-like following. The shoes are comfortable enough to wear sans socks (which this author does, often), and they’re machine washable too. What’s more, the shoes are made with ZQ-certified merino wool and other premium natural materials, so they’re gentle on the planet. Aside from the ever-popular Wool Runners and Wool Loungers, Allbirds now offers Smallbirds, AKA adorable, pint-sized Wool Runners for toddlers. How flippin’ cute are they?! Forgive the pun, but these are totally a shoe-in gift for anyone on your list.\nNow, let’s get decorating!\nDIY Snowy Maze Box\nWhat’s more fun than opening gifts? Traveling through a snowy maze to reach the gift, first! (Hello, that’s why treasure hunts are so irresistible.) We painted a 3D maze onto an Allbirds box to maximize the FUN of opening the gift. Go the extra mile and gift a toy sheep as well to hint at the merino wool wonders inside.\nScroll on for the DIY.\nMaterials + Tools:\n- Allbirds shoebox\n- Remove the items from your box. Trace the full maze onto the box with a pencil. To really maximize the fun, we made sure the trail would go over four sides of the box before arriving at each shoe pocket. Draw decor around the maze, such as trees, snowcaps, or forest animals.\n- Paint your designs on the exterior of the box, then let it dry.\n- Finish up the outside of the box by painting the trail black. Feel free to add embellishments too!\n- Once the outside of the box is completely dry, paint the inside of the box. We hid the gift recipient’s name inside the box to make it even more special. Add other personal touches as desired, then let it dry.\nAdd your gift back into the box. You’re done!\nAfter the big gift unveiling, save the box for future play adventures with your kiddos.\n3 More Ways to #ScrapTheWrap\nCotton Ball Sheep: Use leftover cotton balls and paper scraps to make 3D sheep! We hot glued these onto an old gift box, then added googly eyes for extra magic.

{"id": "90", "text": "The 8 Best Pieces of Advice Top Nutritionists Ever Received\nEver wonder what the absolute best jewel of advice nutritionists ever got from their mentors, professors, peers and even friends and family? So did we. When it comes to empowering yourself to eat healthy and feel energized, nutritionists have no shortage of amazing deets (and perhaps some outdated nutrition advice they wish you would skip already!). We tapped top RDs to dish out the best piece of food-related guidance they ever received. So go ahead, enjoy that nutrient-brimming PM snack and read on…\n1. The most empowering way to take control of your health is to cook your own food! “The only way to know exactly what you are putting into your body is to be the person who selects the ingredients and the way the food is prepared. Having curiosity for why a food is nutritious or tastes good is inspiring and is what will keep [you] motivated to make the best eating choices. Nutrition is more than just calories — it is our small everyday choices that eventually lead to an accumulated lifetime of good nutrition,” says Rebecca Lewis, RD for HelloFresh, a leading healthy meal delivery kit company available nationwide, who says her mom and Michael Pollan have both been her biggest inspirations and teachers.\n2. Nutrition is not just about nutrients. “Knowing the function of vitamins and minerals and which foods they’re found in is just one small part of nutrition. We don’t eat nutrients in isolation; we eat food, and sometimes complex meals,” says Kayleen St. John, RD, Executive Director of Nutrition and Strategic Development of Euphebe, sharing a piece of sage advice she picked up from a colleague, Laura Rosenberg. “Knowing that broccoli contains vitamin C is one thing, but being able to communicate why this matters and how to make a delicious meal containing broccoli is a different matter entirely.”\n3. Put fruits and veggies first. “The most important, useful and inarguable advice I have ever received (and therefore, pass along to my clients and audiences) is to focus on fruits and vegetables,”shares Julieanna Hever, a plant-based dietitian and author of The Vegiterranean Diet. “Every major health organization in the world agrees with it. Fruits and vegetables are the most nutrient-dense, calorie-poor and health-promoting foods we have. Yet, fewer than 10 percent of Americans consume the minimum recommended intake.” Need to load up on more? Here are 11 recipes you’ll never know are filled with vegetables.\n4. You can only take people as far as you have gone. “One of my nutrition counseling mentors and author Evelyn Tribole said this to encourage me to do my own work on self-acceptance and body image if I was going to be helpful to others learning to reject dieting in favor of intuitive eating,” offers Rebecca Scritchfield, RDN, author of the upcoming book, Body Kindness. Hallelujah to that attitude!\n5. Food is more than just nutrition and numbers. “It connects us to our bodies and how it makes us feel both physically and emotionally (happy, strong, sad, tired, etc…). It helps create an opportunity to slow down and intimately bond with the people we share a meal with (friends, family, co-workers). It educates us about the farmers that dedicate their lives to raise, grow and produce the food for our world. And lastly, food crosses all cultural barriers to help us develop compassion and common ground even with those that are different than us,” shares Lewis. Think of your favorite memories in life — chances are, more than a handful involve being gathered around a table.\n6. Don’t pay attention to food labels. Short and sweet but oh-so-true: “Ignore everything on the food label other than ingredients. Everything else is simply marketing,” cautions Hever. Curious to learn more? Check out nine techy ways to learn what’s really in your food.\n7. It’s okay to have different views than “experts.” “The field of nutrition and the science that supports it is constantly evolving. Some of the most educated and brightest folks in the nutrition field disagree on what precisely constitutes a ‘healthy diet,'” says St. John, who learned this lesson from a professor at New York University, Dr. Kathleen Woolf. “It’s okay to have different opinions than others, just know where your opinions come from (beyond that you heard someone else say it!). Read articles and research constantly, and always ask why.”\n8. Make healthy food taste good. “My culinary she-ro, celebrity chef and author Ellie Krieger, reminded me that people care about taste, first and foremost,” reveals Scritchfield. “I realized that instead of being the ‘food police,’ I should use ingredients like butter, salt and sugar to enhance the flavor and enjoyment of foods to help make it easier to eat healthy for a lifetime.” Now, if you’ll excuse us, we’re off to make healthy brownies (you’ll never know we slipped black beans in ’em!)…\nWhat’s your favorite piece of healthy eating advice you’ve ever gotten?

These rewards are just a some of the many reasons why you ought to consider getting betrothed. And, of course , these benefits don’t stop there.\nAside from tax benefits, matrimony has its own other rewards. Married couples tend to be able to manage to get thier own health insurance policy, gain access to their very own partner’s medical records, and qualify for residency rights in the U. Ings. Married couples could also shield their benefits with a prenuptial agreement, which will help protect their legal rights and make them closer to each other. Here are a couple other legal benefits of matrimony that you might desire to consider.\nAnother advantage of being betrothed is that you may inherit a spouse’s property without having to pay taxes.

{"id": "95", "text": "Clarifi-FW - Advanced Freshwater Clarifier (500 mL)\nAdvanced Clarifier for all Freshwater and Planted Aquariums\n- Helps eliminate cloudy water\n- Improves flocculation and water clarity\n- Enables better particulate removal during mechanical filtration\n- Safe for all freshwater fish, plants, and invertebrates\nCloudy water in an aquarium is usually caused by different types of tiny particles floating in the water from too many nutrients, burrowing activities of fish and invertebrates, or strong water flow stirring up sediment. Clarifī-FW helps to clear cloudy water by using electrical charges to bind these particles together so that the resulting larger and heavier particles can be more easily filtered out or removed by siphoning.\nInstructions & Guidelines\nDo not use in marine aquaria; instead, use Clarifī-SW. Extensive research in our facility has revealed that maximum performance in freshwater and saltwater aquaria is achieved with different active ingredients rather than with one ingredient that is compatible in both types of aquaria. The active ingredients in Clarifī-FW are incompatible with marine aquaria.\nShake bottle prior to use. Do not \"free pour\" into aquarium, which may result in excessive, persistent cloudiness. Flocculation of cloudiness due to blooms of microalgae may result in a depressed pH as the production of oxygen and uptake of carbon dioxide decrease; therefore, ensure that alkalinity measures at least 2 dKH prior to use and do not dose after display lights have turned off for the day (this is the period of time in which pH levels naturally decrease slightly, and an additional decrease in pH due to the afore-mentioned process may be stressful to aquarium inhabitants).\nReplace or rinse mechanical filtration material prior to use; when filtration media nears capacity (signified by a significant decrease in water flow through the exhaust of the power filter, or pooling of water above horizontally-situated filter pad material), replace or rinse it, and repeat as necessary.\nRecommended dosage is ~1-ml of Clarifī-FW per 10 US-gallons (37.9 L). Dilute up to 10-ml of Clarifī-FW per 8 fl-oz. or 250-ml of purified water and stir to disperse; gradually pour the resultant solution into the aquarium in an area of rapid water flow. Allow at least 12-hours for flocculation process to complete; re-apply in 24-hours if necessary. Maximum recommended usage is twice per 5 day period. Reoccurrence of cloudy water after Clarifī-FW has been employed to satisfactorily clarify water is an indication that issues referred to in Technical Background (opposite panel) may need to be addressed. The long-term successful care of aquaria relies upon the employment of sound husbandry principles.\nClarifī-FW is not formulated to remedy water discoloration (e.g. \"yellow\" tint) caused by dissolved organic material; instead, employ activated carbon (e.g. Brightwell Aquatics Carbonīt-P) and/or macroadsorptive resin (e.g. Brightwell Aquatics OrganītR) for this purpose.\nCaution: Do not use in marine aquaria; do not use at night. Keep out of reach of children. Not for human consumption.\nActive Ingredients: Polyelectrolytes", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}
{"id": "97", "text": "People don't relate to future threats from climate change but seeing images of people dying now from air pollution drives them to act, says former governor of California\nGreen campaigners should stop talking about the risks from climate change in 2050 and talk about \"right now\", the former governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, has said.\n\"It drives me crazy when people talk about 30 years from now, rising sea levels and so on,\" he told the Guardian in an interview at the Paris COP21 climate conference. \"What about right now? Thousands of people are dying from pollution. People are living with cancer [because of air pollution].\"\nHe said campaigners should focus on the immediate effects of polluting the environment, because that resonates with the public in a way that distant visions of future harms do not. Most people find it hard to imagine the world in 2050 or 2100, the dates that are being discussed at the Paris conference for a \"long-term goal\" on climate action, he said.\n\"There are people stuck in cancer wards now, tubes sticking out of them - 7 million people die a year because of pollution,\" he said. \"We should be talking about that.\"\n\"Stuff that happens in the future does not mean anything to people,\" he said.\nHe cited an advertising campaign in California that showed small children sucking air through an inhaler, because of the damage done to their respiratory systems by breathing polluted air. \"People saw this commercial, what we are doing to our kids, and thought ‘we have to protect our environment'.\"\nPolls found that the ads were effective in persuading people of the need for new regulations, he said. \"All of a sudden, the poll numbers changed.\"\n\"My job is to get the message out there,\" he added. \"If you do not have people behind you, you can't do anything [on legislation]. Global warming is an extremely important issue, the most important issue. You have to communicate it properly. You have to communicate to people that this is right now.\"\nAt the Paris climate change conference, entering its second and final week, governments are hoping to forge a new global agreement on limiting emissions that would kick in from 2020, when current commitments run out. A new draft text of an agreement was published on Saturday, and is now under scrutiny by the 195 governments gathered in France.\nSchwarzenegger, a Republican, and internationally known as a star in films such as Terminator, was a strong proponent of action on air pollution, and greenhouse gas emissions, while in office. His successor, the Democrat Jerry Brown, joined him in Paris in calling for action on emissions. \"The Paris conference is the biggest leap forward in dealing with climate change. France has been instrumental in advancing this agenda,\" he told the Guardian.\nSchwarzenegger said such joint efforts from both sides of the US political divide were essential to making progress on environmental problems. \"I never paid much attention to [political] parties,\" he said. \"This is a people's issue, not a party issue.\"\nHe said that \"sub-national\" authorities, such as state governors and assemblies in the US, and regional and city governments, could play an important role in bringing down greenhouse gas emissions, by taking their own initiatives independently of national governments.\n\"It is good that this is now being recognised,\" he said. \"It's about [emphasising] efficiency, and alternatives [to fossil fuels].\"\nCalifornia under successive administrations has brought forward a series of measures on air pollution and greenhouse gases, including a pioneering regional cap-and-trade system for carbon. Republicans in the Senate recently opposed Barack Obama's \"historic\" Clean Power Plan to cut nationwide emissions from power plants, and Republican states have filed lawsuits against the regulations.\nIn Paris, a group of Republican politicians from the US has been seeking meetings with the chief officials of leading developed and developing nations. They broadly oppose an international deal on climate change, while the Obama administration has pushed strongly for an ambitious deal in Paris.\nA group of 10 Democratic senators also attended the talks at the weekend, pledging to help President Obama attain his environmental goals.\nThis article first appeared at the Guardian\nBusinessGreen is part of the Guardian Environment Network", "scores": {"score": 3, "score_transform_1": 5, "score_transform_2": 5, "score_transform_3": 0}}

{"id": "99", "text": "Social media influencer marketing is one of the fastest-growing online customer acquisition channels. And while influencers have gotten their fair share of bad press, there’s no denying the reach they have on the ever-important young demographic.\nSocial media influencers can be found on common social platforms such as Instagram, Twitter, YouTube and TikTok. They span industries like fashion, beauty, home products and more. Influencers’ popularity is largely a result of both the trend toward engagement-based marketing and the credibility these individuals hold among consumers. In fact, 49 percent of consumers reported they relied on influencer recommendations, according to a report from Linqia.\nWhen choosing an influencer to work with, have a firm grasp of your objectives. There are thousands of influencers to choose from in every space, so you want to partner with the right one for your business.\nGeoff Crain, senior director of sales and marketing at Kingstar Media, recommends checking for fake followers and low engagement first, then seeing who has an authoritative voice in the space you’re looking to advertise in.\n“For example,” he said, “if you are interested in increasing business in the fitness world, find influencers who are personal trainers or own their own gyms. Their followers engage with their content because they trust their voice to be legitimate when discussing the category in which they are experts.”\nFlaherty added that asking for referrals is a great way to ensure you’re working with an effective influencer. “Not every influencer is the right influencer,” he said. “It depends greatly on your specific budget, your target market. Ask for referrals from other relevant businesses you know who use influencers.”\nMeasuring the results of an influencer social media campaign might take a little extra planning. This effort is typically worth it for how many of your target customers you might attract. If you choose the right metrics and the right influencer, you can increase your market reach significantly. Evaluate which measurements make the most sense for you, and get started with influencer marketing today.", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}

The County Council will be able to hold a stock of kits and order additional kits, as needed, up to a maximum of 80,000 per week. The lateral flow kits are designed for use in asymptomatic testing. We are working up a plan to deploy them. Likely uses include mass testing in defined areas (eg. those wards associated with the highest rate of cases), to support care home visiting policies or in outbreak situations such as a workplace requiring whole workforce testing.\nSince Tuesday the local rate of cases has increased markedly, standing at above 320/100,000 population today. This is significantly above the national average and has increased more quickly than increases in the national rate. Rates across the County in the 17-21’s are significantly higher than the national average. These increases may be a result of a ‘last hurrah’ before lockdown, although this does not explain why Leicestershire has been disproportionately affected.\nImpact on Schools (previous week’s figures shown in brackets)\n- Since the beginning of term there have been 650 (524) cases across 186 (170) schools affecting 426 (354) children and 224 (170) staff.\n- Attendance across all schools was 85.5% (87.4%), including Covid-related absence.\n- The ability of some schools to remain open due to staff illness or isolation and physical restrictions affecting the provision of Covid-secure capacity is an increasing concern.\n- 616 early years settings were open at the start of the week with 8,644 children attending. It is predominantly childminders who have had to remain closed.\n- There have been Covid-related cases in early years settings affecting 52 children and 69 staff.\n- 114 (66%) care homes in the County have reported an outbreak of Covid-19. 22 (13%) homes have ongoing situations, an increase of 30% on last week. Testing results show 1.2% of residents tested positive, double the previous week, and 0.5% of staff tested positive.\n- There are 3 care homes where there is a significant outbreak affecting larger numbers of both staff and residents – outbreaks are being contained and specialist teams are providing advice.\n- Currently there are no designated care homes for people who are Covid-positive on discharge from hospital in the County but residents can access one care home in the City.\n- A new care home visitor policy will be published shortly to take account of Government guidance.\n- Day services risk assessments are being undertaken to determine what services can be safely provided. 60% of people have returned to services, and 19% of people do not wish to do so. Recent outbreaks have unfortunately resulted in closure of some services.\nFREE SCHOOL MEALS AND OTHER FUNDING SUPPORT\nConfirmation has been received that the Government will provide funding that can be used for free school meals to the end of the financial year. The Department for Work and Pensions states in respect of eligibility:\n“County Councils and Unitary Authorities will determine eligibility in their area and target their support within the scope of the conditions set out below:\n· at least 80% of the total funding will be ring-fenced to support families with children, with up to 20% of the total funding to other types of households, including individuals.\n· at least 80% of the total funding will be ring-fenced to provide support with food, energy and water bills (including sewerage), with up to 20% on other items.”\nThe County Council’s allocation is £1,462,000.\nThe Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) (England) (No 4) Regulations 2020 came into force on 5th November. The Secretary of State has enabled all local authorities in England to enforce Part 4 of the Regulations which deals with closure of and restrictions on businesses. The enforcement tools available to local authorities include prohibition notices, fixed penalty notices and when appropriate criminal proceedings may be instituted for serious breaches of the Regulations. The Police continue to lead on enforcement for breaches of the requirements placed on individuals and gatherings and both upper and lower tier local authorities continue to lead in relation to the obligations placed on businesses. However, it is recognised that there are inextricably linked incidents crossing all the regulatory requirements. In response, the Local Resilience Forum has established a Covid Compliance Enforcement Cell. A memorandum of understanding is in place to enable all agencies to share information to deliver a more collaborative, intelligence led enforcement response, with all partners adopting 'the 4 Es': Engage. Explain. Encourage. Enforce.\nDue to non-compliances prior to the current lockdown, the County Council had placed a number of hospitality premises under restrictions to ensure adequate social distancing protocols were maintained, with one premises remaining closed to the public. These directions are now revoked. However, as we approach the automatic lifting of restrictions, Trading Standards officers will be engaging with these and other businesses to ensure appropriate measures are in place, in readiness for a reopening of businesses across the County when the lockdown is lifted.\nThe Trading Standards Service is seeking to improve the quality of the data obtained from the district councils. The easing of the restrictions should coincide with the busiest trading period of the year as we approach the festive period. The Trading Standards Service will seek to deploy its enforcement resources, based on the evidence captured within the data, to ensure there is a focus on bringing the higher risk premises into compliance.", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

{"id": "106", "text": "But don’t let government bail out big pipeline projects for the sake of ‘jobs’\n“So if not jobs, what is the proper economic justification for building pipelines? We need to keep in mind the goal of all economic activity: satisfying the wants and needs of consumers.”\nBy C. Kenneth Reeder\nThe pipeline battle rages on. On the pro-pipeline side, the argument revolves mainly around economics. And a big part of that argument is: pipelines create jobs.\nIt’s true that it takes a lot of workers to build, operate and maintain a major pipeline.\nAnd it’s understandable why politicians and industry make their case in terms of job creation. Voters like jobs, after all.\nBut this is bad economics. All too often our public discourse treats employment as an end in itself.\nThis is a big mistake.\nIf we say the merit of building pipelines comes from the jobs created, then we have stepped into a trap. This trap opens the door for the government to throw taxpayer money at a project even when it no longer serves the interest of the marketplace.\nAll for the sake of protecting “jobs.”\nAnd indeed, this is what is happening. The Notley and Trudeau governments in Alberta and Ottawa have declared that they will provide a tax-funded safety net for investors in the highly controversial Trans Mountain pipeline expansion project.\nWe see this argument come up whenever governments need to justify a bailout of some kind.\nHarper’s government bailed out the auto industry for the sake of jobs. Trudeau’s government bailed out Bombardier for the sake of jobs. And so on.\nSo if not jobs, what is the proper economic justification for building pipelines?\nWe need to keep in mind the goal of all economic activity: satisfying the wants and needs of consumers.\n(And remember: we’re all consumers, and even the most radical anti-oil environmentalists find it impossible to forsake the bounties of petroleum in their day-to-day lives).\nPipelines provide an efficient way to move goods to where they are more valuable and thus more effectively satisfy consumers than otherwise.\nWe frequently hear about the discount applied to Canadian crude due to strained transportation capacity and limited market access. Canadian heavy crude—which can be refined into a multitude of useful products—typically trades at a 25- to 30-per-cent discount off the West Texas Intermediate benchmark.\nThe severity of this discount reflects the fact that Canadian producers cannot get the most capable and urgent buyers for their product. New pipelines help address this problem.\nThat is the real key to the case for pipelines—increasing the capability to move energy products to where they are most needed.\nEven if a major pipeline project only created a single job, it would still be worthwhile because of the service it provides in ultimately getting goods to consumers more efficiently.\nOnly jobs that arise to serve the needs of consumers are desirable and can increase our standard of living. When the government throws money at something to “create” or “save” jobs, it ultimately makes everybody poorer.\nMany jobs actually make society poorer. There is an old nerdy economist joke that mocks the idea of jobs for the sake of jobs, by absurdly proposing that the government hire folks to dig holes and refill them over and over.\nMost people recognize that this would be pointless and keep people from finding useful jobs. But that is the logical path we walk if we think of jobs as an end in themselves.\nNow consider the Trans Mountain situation.\nIf Kinder Morgan abandons the Trans Mountain project, that is a strong indication that it would not represent an effective way to serve consumers, due to political and regulatory interference. It might be better that they allocate capital to other projects without such opposition.\nIf they did this, it would be a strong indication that throwing taxpayer money at the problem for the sake of “jobs” would be a huge mistake. If people don’t want to put their own capital into a project—put their own skin in the game, so to speak—then it makes little sense for the government to step in and throw other people’s money at it.\nResources are limited. We cannot have our cake and eat it too. We have to remember that some jobs must be destroyed for the government to subsidize other jobs. We want jobs that the market deems valuable for the sake of helping consumers, not jobs for the sake of jobs, regardless of the lack of value created.\nLet’s build pipelines. Lots of pipelines. But let’s not do so because of jobs. Let’s do it to benefit consumers who need affordable energy to have a good life.\nC.

{"id": "112", "text": "Now with over 90 strains of weed and The Serenity Room\nWashr Online Laundromat in Cape Town\nThe cyber pick-up and delivery service that’s revolutionising the way we clean our clothes\nOne of life’s greatest schleps is doing the dirty washing. It’s a relentless, soul-sucking chore that spins all the fun out of a potentially great day and sponges up valuable time that could be used doing more important things, like for instance, knocking back a beer or squeezing in an afternoon snooze.\nFiddling around on your iPhone, Galaxy S5 or Apple Mac, however, is more heaven than hassle. So, three Mother City-based digital entrepreneurs weighed these two facts against each other and, after some deliberation and a look at successful overseas operations (like Washio), decided to launch Washr, South Africa’s first online laundromat, to make life a little easier for locals.\n“Everyone needs to get laundry done at least once or twice a week,” asserts co-founder David Shleifman, “so we decided to do something that could free people up from this undesirable household chore so that they can have more time to relax or focus on work.”\nTo benefit from the convenience of this mobile-friendly e-service, all that Capetonians have to do is visit the venture’s super user-friendly website (Washr.co.za) on a PC or smartphone, register by filling out a short form and then place an order, specifying the date, time and place they’d like their dirty clothes to be collected. A driver will then arrive at the requested location within the chosen hour slot to collect the laundry and whip it off to be washed, dried and folded, and within the next 24 hours, garments will be returned to the specified address, smelling fresh and looking spotless (the turnaround time is only longer than 24 hours for complex dry cleaning requests).\nPick-up and delivery is 100% free, and all orders are on demand, which means that if you want your socks and undies rinsed right now, Washr will be at your doorstep within two hours of the order being placed, so you don’t have to recycle old items day after day until you have the time to wash them on the weekend.\nThe touch-of-a-button business, which has been billed as the ‘Uber for laundry’, currently services busy urbanites based in the CBD, on the Atlantic Seaboard or in the Southern Suburbs and will soon expand to other areas too. It only works with reputable, eco-friendly laundromats in and around Cape Town and will wash and dry clean absolutely anything that can be washed or dry cleaned, from work shirts, winter coats and evening dresses to sleeping bags, double-bed duvets, curtains and carpets. Customers can also make a note on the online form if they want a specific item to be ironed or to receive special care.\nAnd the cherry on the proverbial cake? When clean clothes are delivered to your office space or home, the neatly folded package comes complete with a chocolate or cookie of some kind – a nice little touch that speaks volumes for the personal service that this Mother City start-up promises.\nAside from the surprise treat though, it’s the click-of-a-button convenience that makes this cyber washroom so wonderfully appealing. It’s definitely going some way towards saving critical beer-drinking time and lessening the dullness of domestic life.\nTip: Washr is offering all CapeTownMagazine.com readers 10% off their first laundry load. Simply insert the voucher code CPTMAG10 into the ‘Extra Info’ box when placing your order.\nThe Bill: Rates are slightly more expensive than those at conventional laundromats, but they’re still fair considering that pick-up and drop-off is free. A standard wash and fold costs R24p/kg (5kg is the minimum weight), and all other prices are clearly marked on Washr’s website. Payment is also very easy: patrons receive an invoice via email an hour or two before their clothes are dropped off and they can then pay with cash or via an EFT or SnapScan. Remember, CapeTownMagazine.com readers get 10% off their first load (see the tip above).\nOpening Hours: Monday – Friday: 7am – 8pm; Saturday – Sunday: 9am – 12pm (customers can obviously make laundry requests at any time, but these are the hours during which orders are processed)\nKeen on buying all your products and services in cyberspace?

{"id": "119", "text": "What is a pre-sale?\nOne consideration to a new home or condo purchase is the ability to purchase a pre-sale property. You may have heard of this term before, it is defined as “a sale held or made before an item is made generally available for purchase”. This means that you are essentially reserving your home and sale price, guaranteed with a non-refundable reservation fee, until the time comes to write the purchase contract, and that timing can vary by builder and project.\nWhy buy pre-sale?\nGenerally there will be a larger selection of suites to choose from in the pre-selling phase as many new home buyers prefer to wait until construction is further along to purchase. You will have to rely on builder floorplans and images to envision your space, and luckily with Carrington Communities, you can visit a variety of showsuites and condos throughout Edmonton to get a good understanding of the space you are reserving.\nPre-sale condos are unfinished condos, so with Carrington that means you have the chance to choose your interior finishing selections or packages, including cabinets, flooring, backsplashes, and lighting. This gives you a personalized design that fits your needs, style and personality.\nAnother advantage of buying during the pre-sale phase is that you will have time to save up and anticipate your closing costs. You are only required to put down a reservation fee (the amount can vary between projects), this is much lower than your required 5% downpayment giving you additional time to save up and also put aside some of the closing costs you need.\nSo if you can use a bit of creativity and imagination buying pre-sale gives you the opportunity to secure the condo of your dreams early on!\nAre pre-sale prices lower?\nMarket conditions dictate new home prices, so it really depends on when you buy. With Edmonton’s ideal housing prices you may have the opportunity to build some equity before you even move in, but that will depend on a lot of other factors down the road as future market conditions cannot be guaranteed.\nOne thing to consider is your mortgage approval, you will need to wait until you have entered a contract to fully secure your mortgage rate. You should still get pre-approved so that you can be confident you will be able to afford your new home when the time comes. With Carrington and our trusted mortgage partner Ownest Financial it is easy to get pre-approved, all from the comfort of your home.\nWhere can I learn more?\nVisit our communities currently in the pre-sale stage, including Edge and Elan, both in southwest Edmonton. Our experienced sales associates can guide you through the process from pre-sale to contract to possession.", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

{"id": "126", "text": "Welcome to our winter coaching walk, the next in our series of blog posts by Juliet Flynn about using the natural seasonal shifts as prompts for our thinking.\nI had hoped as I wrote to be inspired by a view outside of a snowy scene, a picture postcard winter. However, snow is much less common here in the UK than its place in my childhood memories would suggest, so my view is instead more grey than sparkling white! I am just back from a short walk and, despite the dull cold, it was still a refreshing and reflective opportunity.\nWinter can conjure up images of hiding, scarcity and retreat, long periods of darkness and loss. But what if we were to view it with a different lens?\n“Winter is a time of withdrawing from the world, maximising scant resources, carrying out acts of brutal efficiency and vanishing from sight; but that’s where the transformation occurs. Winter is not the death of the life cycle, but its crucible.”“Wintering”, Katherine May\nWinter is challenging to the natural world, but not fatal; if it were, we would not be here. As humans, we have evolved to protect ourselves from its harsher elements, inside our centrally heated homes or outside in our insulated clothing. Have we perhaps lost our connection to its purpose, its meaning? The opportunity to recover and rest, face harsh elements with courage and emerge stronger? Let’s use our coaching walk today to reconnect.\nWe start, as ever, with a moment to settle into our walking space. If your walk is going to be out in the elements, perhaps use your piling on of layers, hats, scarfs, boots etc. as that opportunity – do it mindfully, notice how each thing feels against your skin, express gratitude for each item and how it will protect you once you step outside.\nIf your walk is inside due to self-isolation or simply the cold, then we can repeat a similar ritual – look around mindfully, notice which elements of your home are protecting you from the outside and express a moment of gratitude.\nAnd then take a step. It might be small and tentative, like mine was today on the icy pavements. Winter is not a time for large, exaggerated movements, rushes of energy or explosive displays of momentum. We want to conserve our energy to see us through the scarcity of the season, and our walk can reflect that.\nLook up and around you. What do you notice about the way nature prepares and responds to winter? Find something that is a wintery item and explore its metaphor for you. Ask yourself, “How does this represent my winter, and how does that make me feel?” If you aren’t sure, use this rather ordinary winter photo of mine, because in any scene there can be inspiration:\nWhat do you notice? The tree’s bare branches holding the weight of the snow? The yellow daffodils determined to share a splash of colour? The hanging bird feeder, the cleared path, the grey sky, the twilight haze, the lamp reflected in the window? What do they mean in metaphor to you?\nI see a stoic cherry tree, having suffered a spate of blackfly earlier in the year, courageously and resolutely holding firm to its frame, buoyed briefly by the visiting starlings when they come to feed. I can connect to that – this last year has thrown us many challenges, but I am still here, my similarly stoic core knowing that this too will pass and if I just focus on keeping myself strong, healthy and secure along with the occasional moment of joy, then I will be ok.\nWhat is your winter story? Perhaps these questions prompt something for you:\n- Without the rich abundance and flashy colour of the other seasons around us, what do we notice is at the core of what we need to stay alive and safe?\n- In our work, in our lives, what will help us flourish in lean times?\n- What benefit would a period of hibernation and self-care bring, and what might it look like?\n- Hibernation and rest is important, but what might you instead be hiding or retreating from that deserves your attention?\nWinter, of course, is not just about holding on… earlier in winter we have festivals and joy, celebration and warmth, reflection and family: Christmas, Saturnalia, Hanukah, Yule, Hogmanay and others. And, of course, some more contemporary traditions such as the many Boxing Day or New Years Day icy sea swims (plunging into freezing water is apparently good for you — I’ll happily leave that particular experience to others.)\nAnd for some this is their first winter so they may not be quite sure what to make of it yet…\nYou can connect with Juliet on LinkedIn here.\nGet Free Coaching and Mindfulness Resources\nJoin our community for free and get a host of free resources, including our guide to becoming a professional coach, access to our coaching webinars, a free mindfulness e-kit and much more.", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}

{"id": "132", "text": "An antitrust lawsuit over the proposed mega-merger between T-Mobile and Sprint is now in the hands of a federal judge after an attorney for more than a dozen states called the deal “presumptively anticompetitive.”\nU.S. District Judge Victor Marrero of New York heard final arguments Wednesday in the trial over a merger that would form a third national wireless giant alongside Verizon and AT&T.\nT-Mobile and Sprint want to “create a new, world class network with lower costs and better service for consumers,” David Gelfand, an attorney for the companies, told the judge, adding that “the world with the merger holds tremendous promise to revolutionize the industry.”\nBut Glenn Pomerantz, the lead counsel for the states, argued the merger was “presumptively anticompetitive” and that the remedies proposed to address its effects — including the sale of Sprint’s prepaid business and some wireless spectrum to Dish Network — were inadequate.\nIf T-Mobile and Sprint merge, consumers would be “at risk for paying billions of dollars more every single year” for wireless services, he said.\nWitnesses in the trial included former Sprint CEO Marcelo Claure, T-Mobile CEO John Legere, and Dish CEO Charlie Ergen.\n“Many investors believe that the case hinges on Charlie Ergen’s ability to establish himself and Dish as a viable and credible fourth wireless competitor,” analyst Walt Piecyk at Lightshed Partners wrote in a client note. “We believe he did that … under cross examination.”\nPomerantz pointed out in his closing argument that even if Dish does enter the wireless market, it will take years to build its own network and establish a customer base anywhere near where Sprint’s is now.\nHe also rejected the companies’ claim that Sprint will cease to be a meaningful competitor if the merger fails, calling it “the Hail Mary Pass” of defenses in antitrust cases. “Sprint simply needs to pull up its sleeves and compete,” he said.\nPaul Gallant, an analyst at Cowen, put the odds of Judge Marrero approving the merger at only 40%. The states “likely raised enough questions about [the] Dish fix and merger synergies to prevent Marrero from accepting them,” he said.\nJustin Sullivan/Getty Images", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}

{"id": "144", "text": "Charged With Auto Theft in Illinois? Here’s What You Should Do\nWhen charged with auto theft in Illinois, you may find yourself facing felony-level penalties — up to 15 years imprisonment and fines capping at $100,000.\nUnless you’re okay with more than a decade behind bars and fines that amount to financial ruin, it’s imperative you take any auto theft charge you face very seriously.\nYour first step is to educate yourself about the laws surrounding auto theft in Illinois, and potential defenses against these charges. Then, find an attorney who can help you build the right defense for your case.\nIn this post, we’ve provided a basic guide for what to do when charged with Illinois auto theft.\nFirst, Find an Illinois Attorney with Auto Theft Experience\nAuto theft is one of the most common property crimes in Illinois. Much like other types of property crime, there must be both action and intent. Professional legal consultation will allow you to better understand the law and how your situation fits.\nIn order to secure an auto theft conviction against you, prosecutors must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that you:\n- Committed theft by exercising unauthorized control, using deception to gain control, or obtaining control of an auto you knew was stolen, and\n- Intended to permanently deprive the owner of the auto\nIf the prosecution is unable to prove these two things, the charges will either be dropped or reduced to a lesser charge. Joyriding is a good example.\nNext, Build Your Defense against Illinois Auto Theft Charges\nDefenses for auto theft focus on disproving one or both of the above elements. The right strategy will depend on the specifics of your case.\nWhen you meet with your lawyer, you’ll have the opportunity to share every detail and circumstance surrounding your situation. Remember, client-attorney privilege allows you to be completely honest about what’s going on.\nOnce a timeline has been established and the details filled in, you and your Chicago defense attorney will be able to begin building the best possible defense.\nIn the meantime, we detail commonly applied approaches and the contexts under which they may be used.\nLack of Evidence\nThe prosecution must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that you committed the theft in question. Circumstantial evidence is not sufficient for a conviction.\nIf your attorney feels that the evidence against you doesn’t conclusively prove that you committed this act, he or she may employ the lack of evidence defense.\nClaim of Right or Ownership of Property\nIf you’re able to establish that you had a good faith belief that the auto in question was yours, or that you had the authorization to use it, you may have an affirmative defense.\nTypically, defendants are able to provide evidence supporting a good faith belief — a bill of sale or promissory note if claiming the car is theirs, or even something as brief as a text message granting permission can serve as proven authorization to use the vehicle.\nLack of Intent to Permanently Deprive the Owner of the Car\nAdditionally, it may be possible to prove that you did not intend to keep the auto, thus striking the element of intent to permanently deprive the owner of it.\nSay you left the car parked in plain sight to be easily found and returned to its owner (instead of submerged in a pond, for example). A possible argument exists for lack of intention of actual theft.\nSimilarly, returning the car to its owner is conclusive evidence you never intended to permanently take it. The incident could instead be joyriding, or criminal trespass to vehicles.\nThe entrapment defense applies when you did commit auto theft, but were induced to do so by a third party specifically so that you would be prosecuted. They compelled you to commit a crime you wouldn’t otherwise commit.\nIn any case, facing auto theft charges can mean playing with your life. If there’s no other lesson you take with you, it is that fighting back is a must. That and a skilled Chicago auto theft attorney will be able to determine the best possible course of action for your case.\nAbout the Author:\nAndrew M.

{"id": "145", "text": "Subscribe to Spotify\nIn this episode of The Inner Chief podcast, we speak to telecoms industry disruptor, Alex West, CEO of Swoop, on being the calm in the chaos, trust and vulnerability, and building a high-performing culture through metrics.\nAlex is currently the CEO of Swoop, a telecommunications company backed by Andrew Forrest’s Tattarang, and which has had a stellar year, including listing on the ASX followed by six acquisitions.\nAlex has been involved in around 50 company acquisitions while in senior roles with some of Australia’s leading telcos, including Superloop and PIPE Networks (now TPG), and has also raised more than $66 million in equity in his 20-year career.\nHe cut his teeth as a graduate engineer at Telstra, before climbing the ranks to Chief Operating Officer at Vocus Group.\nAlex holds a Bachelor of Computer Engineering from the University of Newcastle, and a Master of Engineering Management from the University of Technology, Sydney.\nIn this episode we talk about:\n- How remaining calm, even when things go wrong, is his superpower;\n- The shift from executive to CEO when you’ve spent two decades in the same industry;\n- Leading a high-performing team through trust and vulnerability; and\n- Cultivating a strong company culture of using metrics and dashboards.\nConnecting with Alex West\nYou can connect with Alex via LinkedIn\nBooks and resources\n- Start with Why – by Simon Sinek\n“Things will always go wrong; my engineering background taught me to remain calm, avoid blame and just work through the problem.”\nOn early career lessons\n- Telstra takes a lot of time to train their graduates and their new staff. They didn't actually expect anything from you in that first 12 to 24 months, they just wanted you to learn. You did odd jobs and filled in a lot of administrative tasks, but they weren't looking for you to be a proper engineer at any time at the beginning.\n- Not a lot of companies have the time or the resources to do that. So you don't often get that level of training that you would get at a big company with resources and a lot of experience.\nOn his superpower\n- Remaining calm. Not everything goes well, things will break. Things will always go wrong, remaining calm when that happens avoiding blame and just working through the problem, which obviously comes from an operations and engineering background.\n- If you're authentic, honest and calm, people will want to work with you again. So my actual superpower is convincing people to come work with me again. Some of the people that I'm currently working with in this company, I’ve worked with for 15 odd years at four different organisations, some worked with me previously in two or three different companies. And so we're coming back together and trying to build something that we can obviously all be proud of.\nOn his most valuable learning experience\n- I did a Master's course very early on in my career and there were some finance subjects in there that I just keep relying on. In engineering, you learn to build things and solve problems, you don't necessarily always understand the finances. So that Master’s course dumbed it right down and I was able to build from that throughout my career.\n- As you move from Project Manager to Operations Manager to COO to CEO, understanding how to put financial statements together or understand and read financial statements when you're not from an accounting or finance background, becomes incredibly important. It's probably the one thing I think is missing from other executives (other than the CFO).\nOn moving from COO to CEO\n- Learning that I was either responsible for everything or responsible for nothing. As a Chief Operating Officer or an operations role, I was completely responsible for the operations of the business, making sure that we were delivering services and keeping customers connected and making sure everyone was happy.\n- You move to CEO and you're responsible for that and the performance of the company, but there's nothing I can individually do to fix that. I have to rely very heavily on the team around me and make sure that they have all the things they need and all the knowledge and they're able to do it.\n- How does the sales process work? How does marketing function? What are the things that I need to ask to make sure that my Chief Revenue Officer is doing to make sure that the operations managers can do what they need to do and so on.\n- Effectively you're trying to get people to answer their own questions. No one's coming to an executive level with absolutely no idea. All I'm really trying to do is pull that out of them by asking, “What do you think you should do?”\n- It’s a no-brainer, but the moment you get people to start talking and going through all their options, making sure that if they're looking at something from a cross-silo perspective is whether they have spoken to the other executives. I’m also reminding people to talk to each other, which is a key part of my job.\nOn sagely mentor advice\n- One of my mentors, Bevan Slattery, his view of the industry taught me to view big and work out a way to compete. And his view was simply to just go off and compete. You build the things that they're not doing despite the fact that they build some amazing infrastructure.\n- He taught me, particularly in negotiation, to actually ask for what you want. Most people are afraid to say, “Can I have this?” or “I think we should do it this way.”\n- How you ask is part of the negotiation style. But actually just ask for it, even when you think it's a crazy idea, because the worst thing that they can potentially say is no, but they might actually say yes, so you can benchmark conversations. But put that aside and just say, “We would like to do this” and off you go.\nOn his number one interview question\n- We were recently interviewing for a Head of People & Culture and my CFO, who was interviewing with me, asked a question about coming out of the pandemic, and how would the candidate get all the people back into the office. Now, what was interesting about the question was that it wasn't something we were looking to do and something we were potentially moving away from. That was the real trick of that question – seeing whether or not someone would have the convictions to stand up for what they actually believed in, not just, effectively mislead an interviewer.\n- So my advice here is to ask something that you don't necessarily believe in to see whether or not people will actually tell you what you want to hear or actually tell you what they believe and what they think you should do to collaborate. Because I don't need seven people working for me that just agree with me, because that's a surefire way to put business into the toilet.\nOn differentiating the business\n- Listening to customers, making sure we're taking their feedback in adjusting our process. So one of the reasons why we choose to own our infrastructure and sell more on what we build, as opposed to what other people build, is we can control that.\n- The main thing is making sure people are contactable. So, having local support centres. And it's not how long you spend on the call, it's whether you actually service the customer and fix what they need.\n- And then building infrastructure to back that up. The best service is actually no service. Make sure that you can build a reliable network that hardly ever goes down. The less calls we get, the better.\nOn building a high performing team\n- You can't do it all yourself, but in terms of bringing a team together, trust and vulnerability are key. I know that I can't do everything and so I trust my team to do it and tell them that I trust them to do it. We have to rely on each other to actually achieve an outcome.\n- We, as an executive or even as a company, succeed and fail and grow together. If one division's not doing what they need to do, then none of us will actually succeed. So it's helping each other, keeping each other accountable.\n- And how do you drive that? You've got to know your numbers and keep people accountable for what they're doing. But also, encourage people to reach out and be vulnerable and say, “I don't know what I'm doing here.\n- I often encourage my executive to look for mentors outside of the business to say, “Is there any coaching you need? Or is there someone on the board you can talk to?”\n- You have to define what success looks like. So 12 to 12.5 in EBITDA is our key metric, so just making sure that we keep that as a focus and then working back from there.\n- So, to achieve that metric, we need a certain revenue, and to get a certain revenue, we need a certain amount of sales at a certain gross margin. And so you just keep tracking that week on week. We get weekly dashboards, we know how many sales we did last week. We know how many connections we did. We know how many customer calls we had and just keep watching those for trends. What happened last week to what happened this week to what happened last month to what happened this month? Is it going a certain way? Is there a corrective action that we need to take? Is there something that's not working that we're trying? And then have a plan to, if this isn't going the direction we need to, what direction does it need to go?\nOn the value of partnerships\n- Whilst I said we're independent, we still sell products that other people build and manage processes on behalf of our customers, and that is part of why we're successful. And so our role is to support them delivering what we do, which is network infrastructure or deliver communications infrastructure so that they can add their products on top.\n- That's a significant growth opportunity for us as 40 to 50% of our revenue comes from those wholesale partners, who actually own the end customer relationship, and we are just supporting them.\nFinal message of wisdom and hope for future leaders\n- Get the right team around you. People that you want to work with, people that you respect, and then motivate them to work together when you're not in the room. If you can do those two things, you'll ultimately be successful because you can't do it on your own.\nMINI-MBA IN LEADING HIGH PERFORMANCE TEAMS\nLimited spaces per intake", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

{"id": "147", "text": "One day, a sixth-grade student noticed a classmate cutting his arm with a small razor. Trying to do the right thing, she took it from him and threw it away. Surprisingly, instead of being commended for her act, she received a ten-day school suspension. Why? She briefly had the razor in her possession—something not allowed at school. Asked if she would do it again, she replied: “Even if I got in trouble, . . . I would do it again.” Just as this girl’s act of trying to do good got her into trouble at her school (her suspension was later reversed), Jesus’ act of kingdom intervention got Him into good trouble with religious leaders.\nThe Pharisees interpreted Jesus’ healing a man with a deformed hand as a violation of their rules. Christ told them if God’s people were allowed to care for animals in dire situations on the Sabbath, “how much more valuable is a person than a sheep!” (Matthew 12:12). Because He’s Lord of the Sabbath, Jesus could regulate what is and isn’t permitted on it (vv. 6–8). Knowing that it would offend the religious leaders, He restored the man’s hand to wholeness anyway (vv. 13–14).\nSometimes believers in Christ can get into “good trouble”—doing what’s honors Him but what might not make certain people happy—as they help others in need. When we do, as God guides us, we imitate Jesus and reveal that people are more important than rules and rituals.\nSource: Our Daily Breat", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}

{"id": "149", "text": "Ever read a passage so good it gave you goosebumps? What is that word-magic that can transport a reader to another time, another place?\nTwo readers kindly shared favorites from their memoirs with us, as examples. Here’s one I loved, from Dana Quinney’s second memoir, Wildflower Woman (and I bet you’ll love it, too!):\nOnce in a while, a chilling sound would come drifting through the forest, soft and directionless as mist. A low, breathy sound like someone blowing across the neck of a bottle: ahhhh, ahhhh, ahhhh. When we heard this the small hairs would prickle at the backs of our necks and down our arms. This was the voice of a cassowary.\nYou wanted to keep reading, right?\nI could feel the damp, misty air of the forest. I could hear the deep, breathy sound. My nerves prickled at the hint of danger. I wanted to keep reading to find out what was happening. And what the heck was that dangerous critter?!\nIt seems almost sacrilegious to dissect a passage so beautiful. But why is it that passages like this work so well? How do they hold the power to transport us to that place, to make us feel the author’s feelings?\nHere’s another passage, this time from a memoir-in-progress by Candy Wafford:\nI would love to say to you that I remember walking out of the bedroom, the way the carpet felt beneath my feet, that my hands grasped the wooden railing along the staircase. But I don’t remember those details. I just remember being in the hallway at the top of the stairs, alone, realizing it was true. Mama was gone. There’s no one to take care of me now.\nThis example is compelling in a different way. For one thing, the writer is speaking directly to you, as if making you part of a conversation. For another, instead of sharing specific sights or sounds, she lets you share in a feeling – standing at the top of the stairs, shell-shocked and alone.\nWriting Tips to Take Away:\nSo, what’s the magic in passages like the ones shared above? And how can you add a dash of that special something to your own memoir? Here are four simple writing tips:\n- Weave in the senses. Evoke images for your reader using sight, sound, smell, touch, and taste. Just not all in the same paragraph, please! This particular dash of magic is best used sparingly.\n- Let the shared experiences of life be a bridge to your reader. We’ve all heard the deep, resonant sound produced by blowing across the lip of a bottle. We’ve all had moments when outward details seem to vanish in the shock of unwelcome news. There’s magic in common, humble details and experiences we’ve all shared.\n- Let less be more. Hinting at something can be far more compelling than stating a bare conclusion. In the passage above, for example, describing the small hairs prickling on your neck is a far more effective way to transport your reader to a moody place than saying, “I felt scared.”\n- Sprinkle your work with short sentences. Try leavening longer passages with sentences of just three or four words. “Mama was gone” – how much stronger could that be?! Short sentences say to your reader: “This. This is important.” They give your reader’s eye a chance to pause, to rest. Most of all, they interrupt long, run-on thoughts that turn into wordy, descriptive passages that start to sound like lectures, which ultimately make your reader eager to stop reading and go rearrange their sock drawer. See what I mean?! Short is magic.\nHere’s wishing you a magical holiday, filled with love, laughter, friends — and writing!\nSuper thanks to Dana Quinney and Candy Wafford for sharing their memoirs-in-progress with us!

{"id": "154", "text": "2021 ANNUAL REPORT\nCLINTON COUNTY SERVICES FOR THE HOMELESS\nThe Clinton County Homeless Shelter held their annual board meeting via zoom on Wednesday, January 26, 2022. Board Members for 2022 include: Robyn Allen, Billie Baker, Becky Boris, Bill Davis, Pam George, Dan Mayo, Nancy McCormick, Renee Quallen, and Barbara Saville.\nElection of officers approved for 2022 are as follows; President: Dan Mayo, Vice President: Bill Davis, Secretary: Becky Boris, Treasurer: Billie Baker, Assistant Treasurer: Pam George, Assistant Secretary: Barb Saville\nThe following annual report was presented at the meeting by Denise Stryker, Executive Director:\nIn 1988, the Clinton County Services for the Homeless, \"The Shelter\", opened its doors and became the first emergency shelter in a rural Ohio community! For more than thirty-three years now, the support of our Clinton County community has enabled the Shelter to continue its mission of providing emergency shelter, compassionate care and support to the homeless and underprivileged while remembering each resident is a person of worth.\nIn 2021, the Board of Directors, staff and those living at the Shelter, continued following the guidelines and safety precautions established at the beginning of the Pandemic to help keep those working and living at the Shelter safe including limiting the number of residents to follow social distancing recommendations and keeping all communal area locations stocked with masks, hand sanitizer and cleaning products. I am grateful for the compassion and commitment of each Board Member, staff member and resident of the Shelter for their dedication and support of the work we are doing at the Clinton County Homeless Shelter.\nFor those facing and experiencing homelessness during these unprecedented times, staying safe and healthy, keeping a positive outlook to find full-time sustainable employment that can support an individual and/or household is more challenging than usual. Those who are suffering from an addiction and/or mental health illness, being homeless or living in congregate locations are vulnerable and at a higher risk of contracting the virus. Additionally, loss of transportation, lack of affordable childcare, separation from a spouse, and illness/injuries are among some of the many other hardships that the homeless have.\nEach year, it is heartwarming to see the outpouring of support from those living at the Shelter. This year was no exception with those living at the Shelter “paying it forward” and offering their support to answer phones, sort donations, help another resident with chores, offering their help for the staff and others living at the Shelter in need of encouragement or a smile. These acts of kindness give us hope and inspiration every day, and I am forever grateful for the lessons learned.\nIn 2021, The Board of Realtors held their annual Day of Caring Pancake Breakfast in May. The fundraiser is usually held each February. The May event was quite successful, and we are looking forward to a Spring pancake fundraiser again this year.\nShelter staff and Board Members organized a Drive-through Soup Fundraiser held in the Fall of 2021. The turnout was great, and we were able to see many of our soup fundraiser supporters who drove through for delicious homemade soups prepared by our phenomenal volunteers!\nThe Wilmington Area Ministerial Association continues to support the Shelter along with local churches, businesses, service organizations and individuals. The Shelter also received help from community giving through funds awarded by the Clinton County United Way in 2021.\nThe Shelter continued collaboration with the Cincinnati Food Bank in conjunction with the local Walmart store and the Feed America Program in 2021. Volunteers organize efforts to pick up the donated food and distribute it to the Shelter as well as other local organizations that help feed those in need. In 2021, two hundred seventy-six Clinton County households received help from the Shelter food pantry with aid from the Feed America Program and donations from individuals, churches, families, and businesses. Three days a week, volunteers deliver food from the Feed America Program to churches in surrounding Villages in Clinton County.\nThe Shelter's ability to help those in need depends on funding from various sources. The Ohio Development Services Agency Homeless Crisis Response Program (HCRP) emergency shelter grant supplies operating funds for the Shelter. Additionally, the Shelter collaborates with four surrounding counties operating as region 16 and receives funds from the Rapid Rehousing Program (HPRP) Grant. The goal of HPRP is to rapidly move families from emergency shelter into permanent housing. Mental Health and Recovery Services of Warren and Clinton Counties provided a 2021 fiscal year grant to the Shelter. This grant allowed the Shelter to provide essential services to those Shelter residents who were in recovery. In 2021, more funding sources were made available from the Homeless Crisis Response Program Cares grant to cover operating expenses, PPE, homeless prevention, and off-site housing.\nThe Clinton County Homeless Shelter accepted the admin role in the Clinton County Coalition on Homelessness, established in January 2021.\nA professional consultant was hired to help establish the Coalition and a coordinated community plan to prevent and end homelessness in Clinton County. The Coalition includes more than 70 members that meet quarterly and a steering committee that met bi-monthly in 2021.\nThe Coalition approved the Coordinated Community Strategic Plan to prevent and end homelessness at their October 2021 quarterly meeting.\nFour Coalition workgroups including temporary housing, service resources, prevention, and rehousing meet regularly and are using the Coordinated Community Plan to help those in our community who are experiencing homelessness and a housing crisis. Funding for the project was provided by the City of Wilmington, Clinton County Foundation-Legacy Funds and Health First.\nThe Shelter's nine volunteer board members held meetings via zoom each month to oversee operations and make important decisions on behalf of those we serve. The Shelter employs five full-time and three part-time staff members. In addition, previous and current residents of the Shelter \"pay it forward\" by sharing their time and talents to volunteer at fundraising events, to help maintain Shelter property, and to lend a hand wherever needed.\nIn 2021 we provided a home for 148 people, including 25 children. Residents spent 6,361 total nights at the Shelter. During their stay, residents received a total of 31,805 meals and snacks. Clinton County is a wonderful place to live and work.

First, you have to offer users the best price, best product, and best shopping experience.\n\"Always deliver more than expected.\"\n- Larry Page, Co-founder, Google\nYou can attract users to the online store by uploading high-quality product photos to let them know what\nthey are buying. As a result, the audience will enjoy browsing the site thoroughly; meanwhile,\none product may catch their eyes, which leads them to purchase the product; who knows?\nLet's find out how natural and detailed product images can uplift sales\nfor your online store –\nThings we will discuss here:\n- ✔ Online buyers depend on photos\n- ✔ Need for Professional Retouching Services\n- ✔ Different Types of Product Retouching\n- ✔ Create Impressive First Impression\n- ✔ Meet Viewers' Expectations\n- ✔ Increase Customer Base\nOnline buyers depend on images\n\"Amazing things will happen when you listen to the consumer.\"\n- Jonathan Midenhall, CMO, Airbnb\nSo, what does the consumer want and expect from your business platform?\nIn an ecommerce shop, there's nothing more valuable than product photos. So rather than\ntelling buyers about your product, show eye-catchy product images. A blurry or low-quality image\nis not appealing. Buyers want to see what they are buying in vivid detail – a low-quality and\nthe blurry image will be terrible to attract viewers.\nBeware of low-quality images since these discourage buyers from not only buying your stuff but\nalso never come back to your store ever again. Product photo retouching services should be your\nfirst choice of action to get stunning images.\nThe priority of a webshop owner should represent the product image in its best look.\nCustomers also want products to be authentically represented by accurate colors. Product image editing lets you make your products look genuine and authentic. The more time and effort you spend on your photos, the better the original vibe of the product will get.\nNeed for Professional Retouching Services\nIn e-commerce platforms, the single most important thing is the product photos. The math is simple – good product photos sell, and they sell pretty well.\nThe first thing to do for stunning photographs is hiring a professional photographer who knows the ins and outs of excellent product photography. Photography alone, however, is not enough.\nTo make product photos pop and come alive, you need professional retouching services.\nPhotographers will do the shooting, compositing and ensure that the product is well-lit and under ideal conditions. Finally, the product photo retouching service edits the photo to make it desirable to the customers and suitable for viewing in e-commerce stores and other social media sites.\nEvery ecommerce site has different image requirements. The same image cannot be used everywhere because several things may be different – starting with aspect ratios, minimum and maximum resolution requirements, product background requirements, and other miscellaneous requirements; the list goes on. This is why product image editing is so important – the right images need to be in the right places.\nDifferent Types of Product Retouching\nThere is no way you should use raw product photos from the photographer. The RAW images require much work\nas it has too many imperfections. Product photos have some flaws, such as spots, bad backgrounds, wrinkles,\ncrankiness, dirt, unwanted objects, etc. You need to adjust all those flaws with the assist of photo editing services to make photos come alive.\nProduct photo retouching experts edit these images using a number of their editing services.\nThese services are not limited to background removal, clipping path, resizing, general retouching,\nghost mannequin, recoloring, color correction, shadow making, highlights and reflections, dust and scratches removal, and more.\nDepending on the kind of product photo, different retouching services would be required.\nThe better the quality of the picture taken by a professional photographer, the fewer services it will need;\nthereby, it saves money and time in post-processing.\nCreate Impressive First Impression\nFirst impressions usually determine whether the viewer wants to do business with you.\nConversely, a bad first impression means a lost customer. Proper product photo retouching\nhelps catch buyers' attention at first glance and makes them purchase from your store.\nAlong with excellent product photo retouching, you should also attach the product descriptions.\nAgain, the information should be accurate and product-specific for maximum engagement. This can significantly\nincrease your viewers' confidence in your products and could turn them into buyers.\nViewers expect great things from you, so make the first impression count.\nMeet Viewers' Expectation\nCompetition is also great now. Product photos rule the e-commerce world, and if you don't upload realistic product photos,\nyour business may turn down in the long run.\nGreat product images make the whole task of turning viewers into buyers simpler.\nBecause the viewers cannot touch and feel the product, the photos need to speak for themselves.\nTherefore, viewers must get the best view of the product since it is essential to feel confident about its authenticity.\nIncrease customer base\nIf the e-commerce infrastructure were your body and the organs inside it,\nthen product photos would be the blood that nourishes and transports all the right things\nin the right places. Therefore, to bring in more customers to your online first\nthing you should ensure that your product photos are stunning.\nA good product photo brings more customers, and it is an excellent way of marketing and advertising\nfor an online store. When you can attract a large audience and build a solid customer base, it's obvious\nyour sales will be accelerated.\nProduct image retouching not only enhances the image it also inspires buyers to make purchases.\nIt also helps to make your products stand out and increase sales. It can make your branding stronger\nand improve the health of your business as a whole.\nIn the initial stage, when you have just started, your website's impressive look and design\nwill get you the audience you need. Keep using high-quality product photos, capture audience attraction, and improve your sales.", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

{"id": "161", "text": "Nov 23, 2021\nChair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus Pramila Jayapal celebrated Monday's announcement from the U.S. Labor Department that all federal contract workers will be paid at least $15 per hour starting in January, but also took the opportunity to argue that should be the wage floor should for all U.S. workers.\n\"Great news,\" tweeted Jayapal in response to the news. \"Now, let's take this nationwide and give over 30 million workers a much-needed and well-deserved raise.\"\nIn a statement on Monday, the Labor Department said the finalized rule--which will apply to all workers employed under or related to federal contracts--will go into effect on January 30, 2022 and is the culmination of an executive order signed by President Joe Biden in April of this year.\nThe workers who will benefit from the new wage floor, said Labor Secretary Marty Walsh, \"do essential work on our nation's behalf. They build and repair the federal infrastructure, clean and maintain our national parks, monuments and other federal facilities, care for our veterans, and ensure federal workers and military service members are provided with safe and nutritious food.\"\n\\u201cI applaud the Biden admin for taking this critical step to raise the minimum wage for federal contract work to $15/hr. Moving forward, the Senate must act and raise the minimum wage for working people and families.\\n\\nhttps://t.co/nVUWgLMnw8\\u201d— Raul M. Grijalva (@Raul M. Grijalva) 1637616021\nThe federal rule will apply to an estimate 325,000 workers as new contracts are signed after January, though some working under existing contracts may not see that pay bump immediately. According to the Labor Department, the rule does the following:\n- Increases the hourly minimum wage for workers performing work on or in connection with covered federal contracts to $15 beginning Jan. 30, 2022.\n- Continues to index the federal contract minimum wage in future years to inflation.\n- Eliminates the tipped minimum wage for federal contract employees by 2024.\n- Ensures a $15 minimum wage for workers with disabilities performing work on or in connection with covered contracts.\n- Restores minimum wage protections to outfitters and guides operating on federal lands.\nWorkers represented by SEIU applauded the rule.\n\"It would be such a relief to know that my job is protected because it would mean my family is protected too,\" said Ana Ayala, a single mother living in Woodbridge, Virginia who works as a janitor and is a member of 32BJ SEIU. \"In Virginia, most janitors don't make this much or have these benefits which are so critical as a single mother with a child depending on me.\"\nBen Zipperer, an economist with the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute, said in a lengthy blog post Monday that while the rule touches a relatively small percentage of the U.S. workforce, its impact could have positive reverberations.\n\"While not a substitute for a universal $15 minimum wage, there may be important spillover effects,\" said Zipperer, noting that other private employees will likely raise their wages in order to compete for labor and that higher wages will lead to less turnover and higher-quality services in industries like nursing home care.\n\"All in all this the new $15 minimum wage for federal contracts is excellent policy, another step to fixing a labor market that doesn't deliver adequate wages,\" he said.\nEarlier this year, the Senate Parliamentarian objected to inclusion of an amendment to raise the federal minimum wage for all U.S. workers to $15 an hour and progressives expressed outrage that the Biden administration did not do more to fight back in order to ensure that wages would be lifted for all.\n\"At a time when millions of workers are earning starvation wages, when the minimum wage has not been raised by Congress since 2007 and stands at a pathetic $7.25 an hour, it is time to raise the minimum wage to a living wage,\" Sanders, the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, said at the time\nWe're optimists who believe in the power of informed and engaged citizens to ignite and enact change to make the world a better place.\nWe're hundreds of thousands strong, but every single supporter counts.\nYour contribution supports this new media model—free, independent, and dedicated to uncovering the truth.

{"id": "163", "text": "Overwatch 2 Is Changing: Some of the Basic Modifications in the Upcoming Game\nOverwatch 2 Is Changing\nIf you have been following the news related to Overwatch, you are well aware of Overwatch 2 will be playable with no charge and will include a new hero. According to verifiable information, the launch date is on October 4 for PC and a variety of other platforms. Hopefully, it will be integrated into the version that is included in eSports competitions and betting sites here.\nWe got the chance to play the game during the beta period, and it is safe to assume it will be fascinating. Although some gamers refer to the game as “Overwatch 1.5” since it appears to be very similar to the old one, this is not the situation. We now have access to new maps and we tell you that certain heroes have new capabilities and missions.\nAlthough covering everything in one post may be difficult, we will do our best to present you with all the resources you require. Bear in mind that once the game is released, there may be some extra adjustments. After all, we still have a few months before it happens.\nTable of Contents\nMore Resilient Tanks, Faster DPS, and Passive Healing Supported\nThe fact that DPS characters will be more rapid is among the first things you should know about Overwatch 2. Unless Blizzard makes a modification, every hero in this category should receive an increase of 10% in movement speed. This enables them to act more quickly and aggressively when necessary.\nCertainly, Overwatch 2 cannot just give DPS characters bonuses because that would encourage everyone to play them. That is why Blizzard included a fantastic passive healing skill for healers that permits them to recover for 15 HP per second if they have not taken any damage in the previous two seconds. Some supporters will struggle to gain from this, yet heroes such as Ana will seem even more powerful as a result.\nLast but not less importantly, tanks must be mentioned. Regardless of whether you choose D.Va, Rein, or whomever, every hero should have a knockback resistance of 30%. Furthermore, if these heroes are damaged, they will supply the enemy’s DPS and support less ultimate charge by 50%. The goal is to keep some heroes from using tanks to farm their ults.\nBastion Is One of the Heroes with Loads of Changes\nOverwatch 2 will feature new abilities for several of the heroes. There are a few major modifications, one of which is relevant to Bastion. He is an important character for novice Overwatch fans, although not being the greatest hero for the star players. Blizzard appears to be dissatisfied with Bastion’s current situation and the fact that he is not prominent in all brackets. As a result, Bastion in Overwatch 2 boasts a slew of new abilities.\nTo begin with, Ironclad is no more a player in the game. This was Bastion’s passive ability, however, it was removed by Blizzard. Self-Repair and Configuration: Sentry and Tank are the same. “Configuration: Assault”, one of Bastion’s new abilities, allows him to transform into a tank. After that, he can only move at 35% of his normal speed and do 35% less damage. This ability currently has a cooldown of 12 seconds and a duration of 6 seconds.\nThe A-36 Tactical Grenade is Bastion’s second new ability, and it allows him to deliver 130 damage. The ability has a minor knockback and can rebound off walls when utilized. When it comes to Bastion’s ultimate, they have a feature called Artillery. When activated, he can shoot three 200-damage rounds against a single target. As a result, his ult is one of the most effective weapons at killing a specific target.\nDoomfist Has a Role of a Tank Now\nBesides Bastion, who has a slew of new skills, Doomfist is also worth mentioning. This is one of the Overwatch characters who is known for his one-shooting powers. A competent player with Doomfist can make a huge impact in OW 2, and it appears that this will be the case again. Doomfist is no more a DPS as a result of this. He was, to be fair, one of several tankiest DPS heroes in OW, and he was frequently employed as an off-tank. This most likely influenced Blizzard’s decision to promote him to the tank.\nDoomfist now has 450 HP instead of 250 because he has to absorb a lot of damage. He also no longer possesses his Rising Uppercut, which allowed him to flee trouble and land kills when the opportunity arose. Doomfist’s Rocket Punch can now deliver up to 30 damage, while the Wall Slam can now deal up to 40. To put it another way, he should not be able to land as many fatalities as he did previously. Seismic Slam and his ult, in addition to the ability described above, are unique. The first of his abilities allows him to propel himself into the air and then generate a shockwave when he lands. The latter deals 50 damage while also slowing the enemy’s range of motion by 30%. Meteor Strike, on the other hand, deals somewhat less damage and instead of knocking opponents back, slows them down by 50% for 2 seconds.\nDoomfist also has a new Power Block ability. It allows him to block 90% of all incoming damage, as the name implies. Moreover, sustaining over 100 damage increases his Rocket Punch’s damage by 50%, increases its speed and range by 50%, and gives him a 1-second stun.\nOrisa Is Potentially One of the Most Powerful Heroes\nOrisa is the final hero we would want to discuss in this post. She, like Doomfirst and Bastion, has a slew of new skills. They appear to be planning to turn her into an attacking machine capable of destroying a large number of adversaries, rather than a tank that absorbs a lot of damage.\nOrisa will not have Protective Barrier, Halt! or Supercharger in Overwatch 2. Her inherent armor is up to 25 and her HP is likewise 250, which is fortunate. The first of Orisa’s new abilities is Augmented Fusion Driver, which fires a massive projectile that shrinks as it travels. This is one of her damage sources, and it makes use of the overheat mechanic. This means that if she uses it too many times, it will become unavailable for three seconds.\nOrisa’s access to extra ability in OW 2, Fortify, is granted. It will supply her with 120 Overhealth and will slow down her movement by 20%. Furthermore, the Augmented Fusion Driver’s overheating problem will be reduced by 50%.\nEnergy Javelin is another intriguing talent that can aid Orisa. She tosses a Javelin that causes 80 damage, knocks the enemies back, and has a 0.2s buildup when used. If Orisa gets somebody with Javelin and the victim hits a wall, the target will take an extra 40 damage and be stunned for an additional 0.3 seconds. Javelin Spin is a skill that she utilizes to rotate this weaponry for 1.75 seconds, as the name implies. Orisa obtains a 60% mobility speed boost and destroys the enemy’s projectiles during this period. In addition to doing 90 damage, this ability also pushes foes.\nFinally, Orisa possesses the Terra Surge ability. She can use this ultimate to draw foes close and Fortify them. Depending on the duration, this provides AoE harm for 4 seconds and up to 225 damage. Terra Surge treats with low DoT and slows the enemy’s range of motion by 30% while it is active.\n2024 Digital Marketing Agencies Trends\n2024 Digital Marketing Agencies Trends Marketing is an activity that requires a lot of efficiency and creativity.

{"id": "174", "text": "2022 proved a tough year for investors as global macro events saw global bonds and equities down significantly. Globally inflation is on a downward trajectory and SA is likely to follow suit, with prevailing conditions supportive of a lower repo rate next year. SA’s position, however, remains precarious, with accelerated policy reform and private sector economic participation essential to achieve the growth needed.\nThe Strategy’s performance as at 31 December 2022 is shown below:\nThe combined effect of the Russia/Ukraine war, aggressive monetary policy normalisation and the lingering effects of Covid-19 yielded a bleak landscape for investors. This precipitated a fall of c. 18% in both global bonds and equities during the year.\nSouth Africa (SA) fared relatively better than its counterparts during much of the year, despite the worst bout of loadshedding on record. December, however, brought fresh political concerns as the ‘Farmgate’ scandal threatened to derail President Ramaphosa’s presidency and his campaign for a second term as ANC president. Fixed income instruments recorded a torrid year, with the entire local asset class underperforming cash, which returned 4.82%, over the period. SA 10-year bonds closed the year at 10.86%, almost 100 basis points (bps) higher than the close at the end of 2021 and a level not seen since the onset of the Covid crisis in March 2020.\nDespite a high starting yield, the FTSE/JSE All Bond Index (ALBI) generated a total return of 4.26%, which was not only below cash but also marginally behind inflation-linked bonds (ILBs), which delivered a total return of 4.54%. In dollars, the ALBI was down 2.38% in 2022, which is significantly better than global bonds, with the FTSE World Government Bond Index down 18.26%.\nSouth African’s have been holding onto hope since President Ramaphosa took over the helm of the ANC in 2017 and the country in 2018. However, the pace of reform implementation has been disappointing and, if it were not for some very good luck over the last two years in the form of higher commodity prices and the restatement of GDP to a higher base, SA might well have found itself in a debt trap.\nHANGING IN THE BALANCE\nGovernment finances remain delicately placed as the primary balance is expected to stay in deficit until at least 2025/2026, reaching a debt load of c. 80% of GDP (refer figures 1 and 2). Financing costs remain well above nominal GDP and the only permanent solution is for the country to generate real economic growth of between 2.5% and 3.0%. That level of growth cannot be generated by government alone and reforms need to be accelerated to allow the private sector into the economy in a more meaningful way. In the energy sector, private generation can reduce the pressure on Eskom and increase the growth potential of the economy.\nOther critical infrastructure such as roads, rail and water are in dire need of renewal and current government finances are not well placed for the magnitude of spending required. The private sector has the expertise, willingness and means to alleviate the pressure on government and increase employment opportunities in the economy through these projects. The ANC elective conference in December 2022 has bolstered the hold that President Ramaphosa and his allies have on the ruling party. Let this year’s hope be that the time for talking has passed and the time of doing is upon us or else the financial projections below could also become a mere hope.\nINFLATION SET TO SUBSIDE\nGlobal inflation and growth are widely expected to decelerate this year. US inflation, which was stubbornly high over 2022, is expected to average 4% this year from 8% in 2022. SA inflation should also follow a similar path and return to the midpoint of the band by the end of 2023 and is set to average 5.8% in 2023. The market’s expectation for the repo rate has also moderated, with a peak of 7.5% in the first quarter of 2023 (Q1-23), with no cuts priced until early 2024. However, SA growth is expected to decline from above 2% in 2022 to around 1% in 2023.\nThe combination of decelerating global inflation, local inflation closer to the midpoint of the range in the fourth quarter of 2023 (Q4-23), and below-trend growth should, however, start to see expectations for a lower repo rate by the end of 2023. We view a normal repo rate in the range of 6.5%-7%, which implies the start of a gradual easing cycle in Q4-23. Despite this normalisation in front-end rate expectations, SA 10-year government bonds still trade at quite elevated levels. In addition, the implied credit spread for SA bonds still trades at around 50bps above their equivalently rated counterparts (Figure 3).\nSA’S YIELD CURVE – A DIVERGENCE\nThe SA yield curve remains an anomaly. Beside the fact that yields remain very elevated relative to cash, the SA yield curve remains among the steepest yield curves in the emerging market universe. A key reason for this is the fact that National Treasury continues to issue in the very long-end (>10 years) area of the curve due to the fear of being unable to roll over debt in the event of a crisis. The weighted average maturity of outstanding debt in SA remains among the longest in the world, at 11.34 years. This is significantly better than some developed market countries, such as the US, which has an average maturity of 6.04 years.\nSpreads in SA remain very tight due to reduced issuance and an abundance of cash looking for a pickup relative to short rates. National Treasury did issue R50 billion of floating rate notes (FRN) in 2022 to supplement their issuance programme at levels of three-month Jibar + 130bps (currently trading in the market at three-month Jibar + 75bps). Even assuming cash stays at 7.5% and they are forced to issue at spreads of 130bps above cash, this still equates to a level of 8.8%, which is almost 2% lower than where the current 10-year bond trades. We would like to see more use of the FRN programme to substitute for current fixed rate issuance, which could reduce the pressure on the 10-year area of the yield curve.\nWhen interrogating the ratio between the yields on various government bonds (five-, 10- and 15-year) relative to expected one-year forward cash rates, we observe that the ratio between five-year bonds and cash have returned to pre-Covid levels (Figure 4). However, 10- and 15-year bond ratios to cash remain elevated. Historically, 10-year bonds have generally traded at a 10% premium to the five-year ratio. Even if we assume that should now be double, given the deterioration in fiscal accounts, and assume cash in one years’ time will be at 7%, then 10-year bonds should trade somewhere in the range of 9.5%-10% (vs 10.86% at year-end).\nThese two simple arguments on SA’s implied credit spread and the shape of the yield curve lead to the conclusion that SA 10-year bonds remain attractively priced and should trade in the range of 50bps to 100bps lower from a yield perspective.\nSA CORPORATE CREDIT CURRENTLY UNATTRACTIVE\nCorporate credit is an incredibly effective tool that can be used to enhance both the yield and longer-term performance of fixed income portfolios. However, it is important to understand that yield is earned over a multi-year investment horizon, and a long-term focus is essential when analysing and investing in the asset class.\nThe SA credit market is more nuanced than international credit markets, with significantly lower issuance and hence much lower liquidity, making it predominantly ‘buy and hold’ in nature. This accentuates the need for the rigorous integration of credit quality and appropriate compensation in valuation for holding these instruments. In the years following the Global Financial Crisis, credit has been employed as a significant driver of fixed income portfolio returns, but the types of instruments employed have become more complex and less transparent with regards to the actual risk they carry. This requires investors to spend more time scrutinising not only the credit quality of their investments, but also the instruments through which they lend to these entities.\nWe believe that the corporate credit spreads currently on offer are not attractive, and do not reflect their inherent risks. As such, we have been allocating away from credit and allowing our investment in credit to become less material in our portfolios for quite some time. However, with the recent repricing of global rates and credit markets, we believe these offer an attractive opportunity for investors.\nThe local credit market has been influenced by a shortage in supply and an increase in demand for income assets. Issuance this year has been net negative, and according to data from the Association for Savings and Investment South Africa (ASISA), savings continue to accumulate. A supply/demand imbalance of this magnitude continues to distort fundamental credit pricing (see figures 5 and 6).\nIn our view, SA government bonds (SAGBs) offer a much better allocation opportunity, albeit with more volatility. Figure 7 shows that over the last five years, fixed rate bonds have comfortably outperformed floating rate credit for investors who have been willing to stomach the additional volatility. Going forward, we still firmly believe this to be the case. If we look at the expected returns of a five-year government bond versus a five-year bank credit instrument set out in Figure 8, government bond yields would need to widen significantly (almost 2.3%) over the next three years to underperform.\nOffshore credit is an asset class where we can achieve better returns for similarly priced risk. Figure 9 shows that better rated, international banks are trading at a wider credit spread relative to our domestic bank issuance. In a year where risk assets have been roiled by market turmoil, SA bank spreads have tightened.\nLow levels of issuance and tightening spreads have created a guise of safety when it comes to investing in the local credit markets. We believe that allocating significant amounts of capital to the local credit market is unwise and would represent a substantial opportunity cost in the face of attractive valuations in other, more liquid asset classes. SAGBs, despite being more volatile, offer considerably better prospects over the longer term.\nINFLATION LINKED BONDS – VALUE IN SHORTER DATED ILBS\nILBs, like nominal bonds, continue to trade at elevated levels. One can attain returns of between 3%-4.5% after inflation when investing in the SA ILB market. In a world of cheap valuations, the limiting factor is cash and one has to be careful, as with credit, when assessing the relative attractiveness of the various asset classes. Although the real yields on offer are reasonably attractive, the required inflation for ILBs to outperform nominal bonds remains high, specifically for ILBs with maturities of greater than six to seven years (I2029) – see Figure 10. We therefore continue to favour ILBs with a maturity of less than seven years for allocation within a bond fund.\nTHE YEAR AHEAD\nThe global environment will remain in state of flux for at least the first half of 2023 as the battle between monetary policy normalisation, slowing global growth and sticky inflation continues to wage on. Risk sentiment has recovered slightly since the severe bout of risk aversion in the second half of 2022, but SA faces its own challenges – both politically and economically. Loadshedding, crumbling local infrastructure and souring local sentiment have precipitated the need for swifter reforms and increased private sector involvement. The valuation of SAGBs should continue to provide a reasonable buffer, since they trade at significant discount to fair value. We continue to advocate an overweight position in SAGBs, low or no allocation to corporate credit and believe short-dated ILBs still warrant a place in portfolios.", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

Thomas Perdue (Georgia Public Policy Foundation)\nThe Council’s Synopsis\nIn a study published by the Georgia Public Policy Foundation, Chis Denson and J. Thomas Perdue analyze zoning laws and lot sizes in Georgia. Their methodology intends to highlight unnecessarily inflated restrictions for the development of single-family housing. They ask: which districts have notably high or low minimum lot requirements?\nThis question is important to the rapidly growing population of Georgia and the Atlanta metropolitan region.\nEconomics tells us that a low housing supply, especially alongside increasing demand, leads to less affordable housing prices. Supply in Georgia is primarily determined by local governments via zoning laws. If a lot or home size does not exceed a certain minimum square footage, then a local government will not issue a building permit for that property. By that logic, zoning limits on residential density are a primary driver of higher costs.\nBased on their data, Denson and Perdue concluded that Georgia’s local governments do not habitually encourage low density. Many more cities and counties in Georgia have minimum lot requirements below the industry standard than above it. That being said, Denson and Perdue reiterate that “the lack of access and affordability is expected to remain an ongoing concern for a state that is estimated to be over 364,000 housing units short.”", "scores": {"score": 3, "score_transform_1": 5, "score_transform_2": 5, "score_transform_3": 0}}
{"id": "178", "text": "A mortgage offer is a significant milestone in the journey towards homeownership. It signifies that a lender is willing to provide a mortgage loan, enabling the prospective homeowner to purchase a property. In the UK, understanding the timeline of a mortgage offer is crucial in order to avoid any hiccups in the home buying process. In this article, we will explore the duration of a mortgage offer in the UK, as well as factors that can impact its validity.\nTypical duration of a mortgage offer in the UK\nOn average, a mortgage offer in the UK remains valid for a period of 3 to 6 months, depending on the lender’s policies and the specifics of the mortgage product. This duration is determined by the lender and is usually stated clearly in the offer document. During this time, the borrower must complete the property purchase, or the offer will expire.\nFactors that can impact the validity of a mortgage offer\nChanges in personal circumstances: If the borrower experiences any significant changes in their financial or personal circumstances, such as job loss, salary reduction, or changes in credit score, the lender may reconsider the mortgage offer. In some cases, the lender may withdraw the offer or adjust the terms to reflect the borrower’s updated circumstances.\nChanges in property valuation: If the property value has changed significantly since the mortgage offer was made, the lender may choose to reassess the terms of the offer. A decrease in property value could lead to a reduced loan amount, while an increase in value might result in more favourable terms for the borrower.\nLender’s policy changes: Lenders may alter their policies or criteria for approving mortgages at any time. If a borrower’s offer is affected by such changes, the lender may need to re-evaluate the application or extend the offer’s validity period.\nDelays in the home buying process: A mortgage offer can expire if there are delays in the property purchase process, such as slow conveyancing or issues with the chain of property transactions. In such cases, borrowers may need to request an extension from the lender, which may or may not be granted.\nWhat to do If your mortgage offer expires\nIf your offer expires before you can complete the property purchase, you have a few options:\nRequest an extension: Reach out to your lender and request an extension of the offer. Depending on the lender’s policy and your circumstances, they may agree to extend the offer for a few weeks or even months.\nReapply for a mortgage: If your offer has expired and an extension is not possible, you may need to reapply for a mortgage. Be aware that this may involve additional costs, such as application fees, and could potentially result in different terms and conditions for your new offer.\nFind an alternative lender: If your current lender is unwilling to extend your offer, consider finding an alternative lender who may offer more favourable terms or a longer validity period.\nIn the UK, a mortgage offer typically lasts between 3 and 6 months. However, the validity of the offer can be impacted by various factors, such as changes in personal circumstances, property valuation, or lender policies. It is essential for borrowers to be aware of the expiration date of their offer and to communicate with their lender in a timely manner if they foresee any delays in completing the property purchase.\nGet a free initial consultation from an adviser.", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}

Scott took the title and the name of its hero from the village of Ivinghoe, in East Buckinghamshire, England. Set in southern Yorkshire, north-west Leicestershire and northern Nottinghamshire in England. the story follows the Saxon protagonist, Wilfred of Ivanhoe, who is out of favour with his father for his allegiance to the Norman king Richard the Lionheart. Supporting characters include the legendary Robin Hood (appearing as the Earl of Locksley) and his cohorts Friar Tuck and Allan-a-Dale! This novel is also credited with popularizing the Scottish phrase \"caught red-handed\" which refers to someone caught in the act of committing some crime, and has its origins in bloody deeds such as poaching or murder! 📙 ✍️\nAugust 15th is the birthday of famed novelist, Sir Walter Scott. There are several official tartans associated with this Scottish historical novelist, playwright and poet.\nThe Ivanhoe tartan, by Carol A.L. Martin, was inspired \"by the novel by the same name by Sir Walter Scott about a knight in Saxon England in 1194 - a rather dark period of history.\"\nIvanhoe is the story of one of the few remaining Saxon noble families at a time when the nobility in England was overwhelmingly Norman. It follows the Saxon protagonist, Sir Wilfred of Ivanhoe, who is out of favour with his father for his allegiance to the Norman king Richard the Lionheart. The story is set in 1194, after the failure of the Third Crusade, when many of the Crusaders were still returning to their homes in Europe. King Richard, who had been captured by Leopold of Austria on his return journey to England, was believed to be still in captivity.\nInterestingly, the legendary Robin Hood, under the name of Locksley, is also a character in the story, as are his \"merry men\". The character that Scott gave to Robin Hood in Ivanhoe helped shape the modern notion of this figure as a cheery noble outlaw.\nOther major characters include Ivanhoe's intractable father, Cedric, one of the few remaining Saxon lords; various Knights Templar, most notable of which is Brian de Bois-Guilbert, Ivanhoe's main rival; a number of clergymen; the loyal serfs Gurth the swineherd and the jester Wamba, whose observations punctuate much of the action; and the Jewish moneylender, Isaac of York (who is equally passionate about his people), and his beautiful daughter, Rebecca. The book was written and published during a period of increasing struggle for the emancipation of the Jews in England, and there are frequent references to injustices against them.\nFor more about the novel, click the painting of \"The Queen of the Tournament: Ivanhoe\" by Frank William Warwick Topham (1838 - 1924).", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}

{"id": "191", "text": "Here’s a question for employee communicators: If companies with a laser focus on customer experience can outperform those that don’t, shouldn’t you focus your comms strictly through the experience lens of your customers — your employees? In 2017, Forrester found that customer-obsessed companies had the highest median three-year sales growth.\nAs the head of content at a company that offers an omnichannel employee communications platform, I believe your communications strategy should be built around their needs first and foremost and should reach them on their preferred channels, wherever they work and with personalized information that’s relevant for them. It should help create purpose and meaning and should nurture culture and belonging.\nBy now, there shouldn’t be any need to “sell” the importance of employee experience (EX). Just take one quote and one fact:\n• McKinsey says employee experience is “essential for companies to compete effectively,” and\n• IBM-WorkHuman research shows that even a small improvement in EX can have a significant impact on operating income. In one scenario, the operating income increase amounted to millions of dollars for a company with a sales revenue of $600 million.\nThat’s from the company’s perspective. Employees? Employees today don’t always stick around if their workplace experience doesn’t match what they want. In my experience, culture and values are priorities, and how a company communicates, listens to and connects with its people goes a long way toward defining the employee experience.\nWhat Employee Communicators Can Learn From Customer Experience\nIt’s worth exploring how organizations can replicate long-established marketing approaches to successful customer experience (CX) and apply them to shape that all-important superior employee experience, particularly through their workplace communications.\nIt doesn’t take much digging before one word leaps out: omnichannel.\nThis is how John Bowden, former senior vice president of customer care at Time Warner Cable, describes it:\n“Omni-channel … is viewing the experience through the eyes of your customer, orchestrating the customer experience across all channels so that it is seamless, integrated, and consistent.”\nThis omnichannel strategic approach has been used to create successful customer experiences for decades. I’ve found that consumers expect a seamless and complementary experience every time they interact with a company or product.\nSince employees enjoy this experience as consumers in their private lives, why should anybody be surprised when they expect and demand the same quality of experience at work?\nWhat Does All This Mean For Employee Communications?\nLet’s do a comms take on the Bowden definition above. It’s:\n“Viewing your internal communications through the eyes of your employees, orchestrating their comms experience across all channels (email, mobile, digital signage, intranet and social) so that it is seamless, integrated and consistent.”\nThis all sounds very reasonable and desirable, but how do you do it?\nRegrettably, many organizations may not be able to achieve this as long as the’re using a multichannel strategy (which tends to involve siloed, individual and unconnected channels and technologies) instead of a fully integrated omnichannel approach to communication.\nWhat Sets Omnichannel Comms Apart From Multichannel?\nMcKinsey says employee experience “requires a human-centric approach,” and this gets to the heart of one of the most fundamental differences I’ve identified between omnichannel and multichannel communications.\nWhen you adopt an omnichannel communication strategy, you view your employees as your customers — and you put them front and center at all stages of your internal comms process and thinking.\nAnd you do it strategically in a seamlessly integrated way for a consistent experience.\n“Seamless, integrated and consistent”: that’s what puts an omnichannel approach on a different level than siloed multichannel communications where — as far as the employee is concerned — frequently irrelevant information can be pushed to them on multiple channels in disconnected incoherence, creating distracting noise and comms overload.\nOmnichannel comms are employee-centric: Content is personalized and employees can move between different channels that are specifically built to work together across email, mobile, digital signage, video and other mediums. There should be one content source for all channels, and communications should be adapted automatically and appropriately for each channel.\nWhen companies do this, employees can enjoy a more seamless, consistent and integrated experience in whatever channel they interact with.\nMultichannel communications, on the other hand, are channel-centric rather than employee-focused. They typically use siloed channels that are not built to integrate or work together. This can result in a disjointed experience for employees when they move from one channel to another.\nTo create and implement an omnichannel communications strategy, you should:\n• Audit your existing channels. Use a combination of quantitative (statistical analysis) and qualitative data (focus groups, interviews and observations) to find out what’s working and what’s not. Work with other departments, such as HR, to assess cross-organizational comms.\n• Survey employees to determine their channel preferences (email, mobile, digital signage and team and social networks) and when they like to receive their comms.\n• Create employee personas as a first step toward facilitating what I believe is the single most important focus of workplace communication today: information that is specifically targeted toward individuals or groups of people and is personalized for relevance. You should make sure your comms are aimed at a specific “somebody” rather than a generic “everybody.” This can encourage people to tune in to workplace communications instead of tuning out.\n• Measure your comms performance engagement and effectiveness across all channels through unified omnichannel analytics.\nBecause of the employee-centric mindset that underpins an omnichannel strategy — and the fully integrated technical infrastructure required to support it — the focus on personalizing communication can help increase content relevance for employees, reducing distracting noise and information overload.\nIn contrast, one-size-fits-all multichannel comms in which the same content is published in the same way on all channels may have less personal relevance and risks causing some people to tune out.\nWhen you follow the steps above, you can not only facilitate an employee-centric approach to what you do but also encourage your people to engage with your comms when it best suits them on their preferred channel — which can ultimately help support the superior employee experience that contributes to a company’s success.", "scores": {"score": 0, "score_transform_1": 0, "score_transform_2": 0, "score_transform_3": 1}}
{"id": "192", "text": "You’ve probably heard of named drivers, especially concerning reducing the cost of young driver car insurance. But what exactly is a named driver, and how can having one change your insurance premium?\nLet’s get into it 👇\nSometimes known as an additional driver, a named driver is a person who is covered by an insurance policy to drive a car which has a different main driver. Both drivers receive the same level of cover, and if you are looking for cheaper car insurance, having one can lower your premiums.\nBut what’s the difference between a named driver, main driver, and registered keeper? Let’s break things down further.\nThe named driver is an additional driver listed on the insurance policy. Depending on the provider, there can be several named drivers. For example, if you’re a young person, you can add more experienced drivers, such as your mum and dad, to your policy as named drivers.\nThe main driver is the person who drives the car the most. It cannot be the same individual as the named driver, but doesn’t have to be the policy holder.\nThe registered keeper is responsible for ensuring the MOT is valid and the vehicle is taxed and insured. The keeper is also held accountable if there are parking fines or speeding violations.\nHow does a named driver impact the named driver’s insurance?\nThe named driver’s own car insurance is unaffected by them appearing as an additional driver on another policy - the two are considered separate.\nHowever, if they have an accident in the main driver’s car, the main driver is held accountable, even if they weren’t in the vehicle. So choose your named driver carefully!\nHow does it impact the main driver’s insurance?\nAdding a named driver to your insurance can be a good idea for young or new drivers.\nInsurance providers often see young drivers as riskier to insure than older, more experienced ones. Therefore, the insurance cost is usually higher. By including a named driver, especially a parent or older sibling, providers consider the risk lessened, and as a result, the cost is often lower.\nThe reverse is also true, however. If you are an experienced driver and add a more novice driver to your policy, you may see your premium increase in price due to the perceived risk.\nIt’s worth reiterating what happens if an accident occurs when the named driver is behind the wheel. The main driver is considered at fault, even if the additional person is the only one in the car. This can have a negative impact on their own no claims bonus and may increase the cost of insuring their vehicle.\nFronting is the practice of claiming that you are the main driver of a vehicle when someone else is actually the prime user. It’s considered insurance fraud and against the law, carrying severe consequences.\nWell-meaning parents will often try to reduce the vehicle insurance costs for their children by claiming that they are the main driver, when, in reality, their son or daughter uses the car the most.\nIf you’re caught fronting, your insurance policy will become invalid, and you can find yourself prosecuted for fraud. You also risk getting fined, points on your licence and being unable to find a provider willing to insure you in the future. It can even affect your ability to obtain credit moving forward.\n(PS - we've written a separate guide on insurance fraud.)\nHow many named drivers can you have?\nThe rules on the number of named drivers vary between insurance providers, but most will allow three or four additional drivers on your policy.\nCan you get a no claims bonus as a named driver?\nThe named driver cannot accrue any claims bonus on the policy they are an additional driver on. However, if they are declared the main driver on their own vehicle’s insurance, their no claims bonus can accumulate. Some insurance providers offer a discount to named drivers on the understanding that they take out their own policy at a later date.\nCan I be a named driver of two cars?\nYou are permitted to appear as a named driver for two cars, but insurance providers may question it, concerned that you may be fronting.\nDo named drivers have fully comprehensive insurance?\nThe named driver on your insurance policy will have the same level of cover as the main driver. So if you have fully comprehensive insurance as the vehicle’s usual driver, your named driver will enjoy the same level of cover. They will also benefit from any optional extras you’ve added to your policy, such as breakdown or key cover.\nDoes the named driver get my insurance extras?\nJust as your named driver receives the same insurance cover as you, they are also covered by any extras you’ve added to the policy. These can include windscreen or breakdown cover, or legal protection.\nCan a named driver drive abroad?\nYes, your named driver can drive your car abroad. Some providers will also temporarily allow you to add a driver to your insurance policy, so if you’re planning a long trip by car, this might be worth considering.\n*Don't forget: if you're a provisional driver, taking on temporary insurance rather than being added as a named driver could be simpler and cheaper. We've put together a separate guide on the cost of learning to drive here, with some extra info in the table below.", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}

{"id": "196", "text": "The 2020 season is behind us, and now it’s time to start thinking about what changes are coming in the offseason to prepare for next year. We will focus on the roster, examining the salary cap situation, looking at who’s still under contract vs. a free agent, and exploring potential options for freeing up money.\nSalary Cap Situation\nThe 2021 salary cap is currently projected to be somewhere between $175 and $195 million. I’ll use $185 million, right in the middle of that, as our estimate for now. As you can see in the table below, the Bears are fairly tight up against the cap right now (bottom row). All numbers come from Over the Cap.\nThe Bears have very little cap room, and it’s worth noting this is with only 45 players under contract. The Bears will have to fill to 53 for a full roster, and the NFL minimum salary is $660k. Even if they fill out with minimum-salary players, that adds another $5.3 million, which puts them over the salary cap (or very close to it, depending on where exactly it ends up). That’s not to mention their draft picks, which will add a few million to that; the Bears pick 20th in round 1, and last years’ 20th overall pick had a $2.4M cap hit.\nI’ll note these numbers are current as of about 10 PM Chicago time on Wednesday, January 13. They might have changed if the Bears sign more practice squad players to futures contracts (which basically adds in guys at that minimum $660k level).\nSo the Bears are currently a little over the salary cap, though there are always options to free up more money (more on that later). Who do they have under contract making all that money? The table below shows the current depth chart for all 45 players currently signed for 2021 (again, might be a little out of date as the Bears sign their practice squad players in the upcoming days).\nThat roster has a lot of holes on it. The QB and WR groups are terrible, as is safety outside of Eddie Jackson. There’s no depth pretty much anywhere, and they don’t have a kicker or punter signed. There is no realistic way they can fill all of those holes with minimum-level signings, so some money will have to be created (again, more on that later).\nKey Free Agents\nNow let’s look at what in-house players the Bears are at risk of losing this offseason. You can see a full list here, but the most important ones are listed below, along with some thoughts about how expensive they might be:\n- WR Allen Robinson: He’s reportedly looking for a deal in the $18M/year range. Spotrac has given him a market value of $19.9M/year.\n- QB Mitchell Trubisky: Spotrac estimates he’s looking at a top-level backup deal of around $8M/year.\n- OL Germain Ifedi and Alex Bars: Ifedi was a minimum-level signing last year, and is probably looking at something similar this go around, though it wouldn’t be a shock if that salary bumps up to $1.5-2M after he had a relatively solid season. Bars is an exclusive rights free agent, which means he’ll be back in Chicago on a minimum level deal.\n- KR/RB/ST ace Cordarrelle Patterson: His last deal paid him just over $4.5M/year, and I doubt he’ll be looking for a pay cut after back-to-back 1st team All Pro nods as a kick returner.\n- DL Roy Robertson-Harris, Mario Edwards, Brent Urban, and John Jenkins: This is the entire backup group for Chicago’s defensive line, and they combined for 1092 snaps in 2020 after Eddie Goldman opted out. I don’t imagine any of them will be expensive to keep around (unless somebody else pays RRH coming off of an injury), and they all played pretty well.\n- S Tashaun Gipson, Deon Bush, and DeAndre Houston-Carson: These are the only safeties besides Eddie Jackson to see the field in 2020, and Bush/Houston-Carson are core special teamers too. None of them should be expensive, but the Bears could look to replace Gipson with another cheap starter.\n- OLB Barkevious Mingo: Mingo was another minimum-level depth signing who performed quite well for Chicago in 389 defensive snaps in 2020. He also played a big role on special teams, playing over 80% of the snaps there. He could make sense to bring back, but might require a small pay raise.\n- K Cairo Santos: Santos was a minimum-level signing who is likely looking for a big deal after a great 2020 season. For a kicker, that’s probably something in the neighborhood of $4M/year.\n- P Pat O’Donnell: O’Donnell’s last deal paid him $1.75M/year, and he’s probably looking to repeat or slightly improve on that after 2 solid seasons.\nWays to Create Cap Space\nSo that’s where things currently are for the Bears: they have no cap room and a few key free agents who need to be re-signed or replaced with money they don’t currently have to spend.\nThe good news in the NFL is that the salary cap is fluid, and there are always ways to shift money to the future (as Ryan Pace pointed out in his press conference yesterday) or get out from under some contracts. Let’s look at options they have to create cap room in 2021.\nThe table below is a complete list of every player they can cut to free up at least $1.5M in 2021 space. I will note I am not advocating for all of these players to be cut, but simply trying to provide a complete picture of their options to create much-needed cap space this offseason.\nA few thoughts:\n- I’ll start with the 2 biggest names/salaries on here: Kyle Fuller and Akiem Hicks. Cutting either player doesn’t make much sense to me. More realistic options will be discussed in the extensions or trades section below.\n- Jimmy Graham and Buster Skrine are easy players to cut and free up close to $10M.\n- I figure one of the tackles – Massie and Leno – are likely gone, but replacing those players in free agency will be more expensive than the money saved if you want anybody remotely competent, and you can’t count on two rookie tackles starting, so they’re probably keeping one of them (I would guess Leno stays).\n- Those three cuts would open up about $15M in space for the Bears, which probably gives them the breathing room they need to sign their draft class and fill out the roster with small signings (minimum salary or slightly higher).\n- The Bears, unfortunately, can’t get out of the 3 contracts they would most like to: Nick Foles, Robert Quinn, and Danny Trevathan. All would have higher cap hits if they are cut than if they remain on the roster.\nExtensions or Trades:\nAkiem Hicks and Kyle Fuller both have contracts that expire after 2021, meaning the Bears could easily do a back-loaded extension to lower their 2021 cap hit. This is especially true for Kyle Fuller, who has a $20M 2021 cap hit and could cut that in half (saving $10M) with an extension. The same could be said for Hicks, though they likely wouldn’t save more than $3-4M of his $12M 2021 cap hit with an extension.\nIt should be noted, however, that there is no free lunch. A back-loaded extension, which pays the player money upfront but doesn’t count it on the cap until later, can create space now, but teams will pay for that at a later date. I would argue it doesn’t make much sense for the Bears to borrow future cap dollars to pay for a current roster that is clearly not winning a Super Bowl.\nWith that in mind, the Bears could look to trade Fuller and/or Hicks to free up the same money as if they cut them ($11M for Fuller, $10.5M for Hicks). This would likely be an unpopular move, and would certainly make the Bears worse in 2021, but I believe it is in their best interests overall, as I explained in depth a few weeks ago.\nThe final option to create 2021 cap room is by restructuring a player’s contract. This is usually for contracts with large salaries, as teams can convert the salary to a bonus. Then the player gets the same money as they would have anyway, but the cap hits for it spread out over multiple seasons. As with a back-loaded extension, this is good for now but bad for later.\nThe Bears could do this with Khalil Mack ($17M salary), Robert Quinn ($11.5M salary), or Eddie Jackson ($9M salary). You can spread that salary out over 5 years of cap hits, so basically make 80% of it disappear this year, which means they could save up to $13.6M with Mack, $9.2M with Quinn, and $7.2M with Jackson. But again, I want to caution that this hurts the future salary cap; this moves money to the future, it does not make it disappear. It is not really a move that makes much sense when a team is not currently a strong Super Bowl contender.\nTo recap where we are right now:\n- The Bears are currently slightly over the cap for next year when you consider them filling in their roster with draft picks and minimum-salary players.\n- They have a few free agents slated to sign deals well above league minimum, most notably Allen Robinson.\n- Due to this, they need to create salary cap room, but can’t really get out of the worst contracts on their books.\nIf that sounds awfully bleak, it is. With no QB, no salary cap space, and no easy options to create a bunch of it, Chicago is in a really bad spot this offseason, which I already pointed out before the 2020 season started. With that said, they have three options for how to approach the offseason:\n- Tank. One of Chicago’s problems is that they’re too good to get a high draft pick (and thus a premium QB prospect). That can easily be fixed this offseason. Trade everybody with value, which includes Akiem Hicks, Kyle Fuller, Khalil Mack, and Allen Robinson (via a tag and trade approach). Sign nothing but minimum-level, 1 year deals in free agency this year to maximize whatever compensatory picks you might get for somebody like Cordarrelle Patterson (or Robinson if they can’t tag him). Use the draft (with many extra picks scattered throughout days 2 and 3 from the trades listed above) to build up the offense around the QB as much as you can (OL/WR/TE), lose a bunch of games with Nick Foles next year, draft your QB in 2022, and have a bunch of money to spend on the roster around him.\n- Live Within Your Means. Make the obvious cuts of Skrine, Graham, and Massie. Either keep Fuller and Hicks and let Robinson walk, or trade at least one of Fuller and Hicks and use that money to re-sign Robinson. Fill out the rest of your roster with mostly minimum-level free agents and draft picks. Try to get a QB in the draft to compete with Foles. Understand you are not winning a Super Bowl in 2021, but remain competitive while getting your cap situation to a healthy spot and having a realistic turnaround to a playoff team in 2022.\n- Stay Aggressive. This would basically be repeating Ryan Pace’s 2020 offseason strategy. Move money to the future with back-loaded extensions for Fuller and Hicks, move money from Mack, Quinn, and/or Jackson to the future via restructures, tag Allen Robinson or sign him to a back-loaded extension, and use free agency to aggressively fill holes with back-loaded contracts. This gives you the best 2021 team (that is still not a serious Super Bowl contender) but continues to damage your future.\nI really don’t care if the Bears choose option 1 or 2 this offseason – reasonable arguments can be made for both approaches – but they cannot afford to do option 3 again. That’s what they did last offseason, and it basically cost them 2 years (2020 and 2021). Doing it again will likely ruin any chance they have at seriously competing in 2022 or 2023.\nUPDATE: I wrote all this without knowing what would happen with Ryan Pace. Yesterday’s press conference all but announced that option #3 is what is happening this offseason. This is very bad news for the Bears’ long-term prospects. My fear is that the 2021 offseason will double down on last years’ mistakes to set this franchise back for years to come.", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

Here are some highlights, edited for clarity:\nOn his reaction to Thursday night’s loss in Tampa...\nJones: “That was opening night. We were playing the world champs. But what an opportunity for a victory against, again, David and Goliath. We played well. ... What I see is a defense that is going to get better. We have the athletes to get better. We have the scheme to get better. We were playing quality competition. I was really proud to see the good things that occurred during the ballgame. ... We’ve got some guys that weren’t out there that could help us out. We can get better. That, hopefully, will mitigate what happened to us right there at the end of the game on the last drive when you certainly need to make a play to win that ballgame.\n“I felt like that we paid the price of not really having our kicker during training camp, and I look back, and when you don’t have a kicker that is real active during training camp, you may be kidding yourself for the early ballgames. Is he really ready to go? The loss isn’t to be blamed on the kicker, but still, if we would have had some execution on three or four of those kicks, it might have made a big difference here.\n“Offensively, we’re really, in my mind, really what I thought we could be. The two key standouts for me were the offensive line and the defensive front relative to the running game, those two. The big boys played a hell of a game last night.”\nDo you still believe in Greg Zuerlein as the kicker of this team?\nJones: “Yeah. Yes. And I said he’s, again, do you go into the season with a kicker that’s been on kind of IR and been easing along maybe when it’s that vital to have really been in the swing of things? Do you go with a kicker that didn’t do much during the preseason relative to competition that spent a lot of time, which they can, out on the practice field and working the art that way? Yes. We did, and I think we paid a price there in this first opening game. I believe in him long-term and I believe he’ll play better as we get into the season.”\nDid you like Dak Prescott telling Tom Brady “we’ll see you again” on the field after the game?\nJones: “Oh, man, I do. If you want to smile about something that has a big-,time, long-term relative to the season impact on it is Dak. It’s one of the most phenomenal performances I’ve seen because he really hadn’t played in almost [a year]. And for him to step out there and have that kind of night is nothing but encouraging.”\nOn kicking a field goal with 1:24 left on the clock and giving the ball back to Brady...\nJones: “We left him too much time. You can’t do that in our game. You can’t leave a quarterback of his caliber — you just can’t do it. You put yourself into a spot where you have to have a big play. One of the biggest plays of the night you have to have during that drive. And that’s hard to do against a quality quarterback. Everybody is pretty tired out there. Our defense really held up well, I thought. I really did. I thought [the Bucs] might have gotten a little tired, and that was going to be an advantage for us as we got down there at the end of the game. But you give -- with a minute and a half left on the clock, and your timeouts -- you give your quarterback, most of them in the NFL and they’ll take it down on you. So, you got to have a big play. We got a young team that is so talented on defense that we can get a big play in those situations. And we had a couple of opportunities.”\nOn differences between watching this team vs. last season’s team...\nJones: “I expected our offensive line to play last year the way it played last night, and it played — that was a big expectation. I didn’t know that we were going to be as inept against the running game last year on our defense, but last night we were not. And, so, but the difference in these teams, especially on the defensive side of the ball ... it’s upside for this team. We’ve got guys that even weren’t on the field last night that can make this defense better.”\nWhich guys are you talking about?\nJones: “I’m talking in the interior, [Neville] Gallimore. Talking [Kelvin Joseph]. ... I’m talking about [Malik] Hooker. I’m talking about the maturation of those young guys that are in there. Micah [Parsons] was close last night on a few things. He’ll get there on some inevitably. And then I’m also talking about this young group. When you’re a young player and you actually get those snaps, you grow right before everybody’s eyes. You grow. The problem is the price you pay as you’re growing. These young guys are going to do that for us, and then this scheme is going to become even more doable for these guys because they’re going to have more time in it. We’ve got upside, serious upside, on the defense. It’s the best thing, or one of the very best things that if you had to have a positive that you could come out with, we’re going to get better defensively and we didn’t play bad against a good team last night.”\nMore from Cowboys-Buccaneers", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

{"id": "201", "text": "It’s Christmas week, and I know how exciting and fun the holidays can be—-and also how difficult, lonely, and challenging they can be. No one to be with, not enough money, alone in a new city, or at home with a family you don’t get along with, or in the midst of a divorce, just after a break up, or after you lose a loved one. The holidays are not as easy and simple as they look on Christmas cards, or in the movies. It’s a time when we are acutely aware of whatever is missing in our lives, or whatever is difficult. I’ve had my share of difficult Christmases too, a long time ago, when I was divorced, and barely three months after my son Nick died at 19. That was a brutal year. Oddly, I worked harder on making Christmas special for my family in the hard years, than in the easy ones. And sometimes those Christmases turned out the best—the ones I expected to be terrible, and then they weren’t. Trying to cheer up my children after Nick died, I gave a skating party that year for my friends and their children. It didn’t bring Nick back, but it was a warm, loving event that became a tradition we loved every year, until all my kids left for college and everyone else’s kids grew up too, and we stopped doing it. But it was a lovely time of families joining each other during the holidays. We’ve all had our tough years, they’re part of life.\nWe’ve always been about twenty or more, at our holiday table, for dinner on Christmas eve, they’ve always been loud, happy, fun events, with a visit from Santa during dinner. it’s a grown up, dressed up event, and on Christmas night, the next day, we have Christmas dinner with the whole family and all the children in the family, it’s more informal, and really a fun night. Five years ago, my ex husband John (whom we spent all holidays with even when we were no longer married) had recently died, and all my older children went to their in laws for the holidays, and instead of 20 at the table, and John being elegant and jovial and loving among us, we were going to be the 5 younger children and me for dinner on both nights: 6 of us, not twenty, no older kids, and no John. It was a radical change, and a sad time we were all wrestling with, and there was no way to pretend that it was going to be the same, or even a happy event, and we were all dreading it. So I decided to really turn it upside down, and told my 5 younger kids, in their early 20s, that they could do Christmas however they wanted that year. We could get dressed up, as we always did, and have a serious formal dinner, or wear blue jeans and eat pizza, or no dinner, invite friends or not, go to the movies, or go bowling, or leave town together—-if it was going to be different, I invited them to make it as different as they wanted. We didn’t have to please anyone but ourselves and each other. After discussing it among themselves, they decided they still wanted to get dressed up and stay at home, still go to mass on Christmas eve, and no one felt up to having friends over, but they wanted to play games at dinner, and we collected a bunch of ridiculous party games, including the White Elephant game, where everyone brings a gift of some kind, you don’t know who brought it, and you take turns and randomly pick a gift. If someone else likes the gift, they can steal it 3 times, and after that you’re safe, if you like the gift it’s yours. Let me tell you, it was ridiculous, the gifts were funny, everyone stole everything from everyone else, my youngest son flatly refused to give up his Chewbacca (from Star Wars) back pack, which he said he was going to wear to the office. We were loud and silly, had fun, we played lots of games, and cuddled up together and watched movies afterwards, and ate popcorn. Somehow just being together worked, we didn’t have to ‘behave’, and we all missed John terribly, but the love and laughter between us got us through the evening, and it was one of our sweetest holidays. I still have the pink ballet tutu that I stole from two of my daughters during the white elephant game. Sometimes you just have to make the best of what is, when things are different or not the way you hoped, like watching all your favorite movies on TV or DVD if you’re alone.\nAnd I know it’s hard to be alone during the holidays. I hope that you can be with your family, or with friends, or people you like, or bring joy to someone else. And if Christmas isn’t quite the way you want it to be this year, I hope that you get through it peacefully, and that it will be better next year. Life changes, it flows, it gets better, and worse and better again, and everything does not depend on how great your Christmas is. I hope it will be a good one, even a great one, and if it is a small one this year, I hope that you can cherish it, and enjoy it anyway. I send you all my good thoughts, and thanks and love on this holiday, whatever your holidays, and I wish you a beautiful new year!!\nwith all my love, Danielle", "scores": {"score": 0, "score_transform_1": 0, "score_transform_2": 0, "score_transform_3": 1}}

{"id": "203", "text": "(The blog will take a two-week spring break beginning next week to enjoy a visit with our visiting son, daughter-in-law and grandson and work on the upcoming issue of the Amelia island News-Wrecker to be distributed Thursday, May 4. We’ll be back April 27.)\nSitting on the back porch in a pair of shorts, drinking a cold beer, reading a book, and looking up occasionally to watch TV reports of people up north scraping ice off their car windshields reminded me how fortunate I am to be living on Amelia Island, Florida.\nMy Canadian parents, seeing pictures in National Geographic of happy people in Florida eating smoked mullet, decided to abandon the thrill of curling, gourmet plates of poutine and winters that extended from January 1 to December 31. They packed me, my older brother and enough Black Diamond cheddar cheese to last a couple of months, and headed south, a decision that I consider my inheritance.\nI mention this because humorist Dave Barry, a transplant from upstate New York, has a new laugh-out-loud book called “Best State Ever, a Florida Man Defends His Homeland.”\nBarry, who lives in Miami, details in his uproariously funny style, why people move here, why they stay, and why the state motto should be: “It may be hot, but it’s never boring.”\nIn the Introduction he cites the weather as possibly the most positive factor saying: “Any day of the week I could walk out my front door naked and be perfectly physically comfortable until the police tasered me. Granted, sometimes in the summer (defined as June through the following June) it gets a little too warm down here, but too warm beats the hell out of too cold. Too cold means if you stay outside too long, you will die. Too warm means you might have to have another beer.”\nHe writes about how much fun it is watching the weather reports from up north too adding: “Sometimes we get so emotional watching it even at 7 a.m. that we have to have ourselves another beer.”\nIn addition to Florida’s weather he points out there are several other reasons that our state is attractive including: “low taxes, the hotness of its women, not being boring, and Disney World.” Barry explains how in just over two hours we can drive from Amelia Island to stand in line for four hours to get into Space Mountain.\nHe also points out, much to the embarrassment of the rather dim folks we sent to our state capital of Tallahassee, how in 2015 the state marketing corporation, Visit Florida, named Pitbull as a “Florida ambassador” in which capacity he represented our state.\n“Pitbull is a professional rap artist,” writes Barry. “He authored numerous tunes about having sex, doing drugs, shooting people, selling drugs, having sex on drugs, shooting people over drugs, etc. ”\nPerhaps Barry’s hysterical expose of this snafu was one of the reasons Governor Rick Scott fired Visit Florida’s management and the state legislature is considering axing this entire group of ninnyhammers.\nAnd this is just in the beginning of the book. As you read on you’ll discover with Dave the legendary skunk ape; mermaids at Weekie Watchee Springs and my favorite — a visit to Cassadaga, the Psychic Capital of the World (just three hour drive south of Amelia Island and no waiting in line).\nTwo of the funniest chapters in the book are his description of The Villages and a trip with a pal to Key West.\nI promise you that there’s a laugh on almost every page of this hilarious book, and at the end you’ll find yourself wishing it was longer.\nIf you got the blues or just a cold then this book is the cure.\nSpeaking Of Florida: Illegal aliens cost Florida households headed up by a U.S. citizen almost $981 per year but that figure is most certainly much higher by now.\nThe Foundation for American Immigration Reform (FAIRUS.org) says there are 820,000 illegal aliens living in Florida and that they cost Florida tax payers $5.5 billion in 2010 at last count.\nAnd forget those who claim these people pay their share of taxes. They don’t says FAIRUS. They only paid in $261 million in taxes collected by the state, leaving $5.2 billion for the tax payer to pick up.\nThat comes to $3.34 billion in education; $660 million in health care; $317 million in public assistance; and $568 million in general government services.\nBut relief may be in sight as illegal border crossing from Mexico have fallen 36 percent since February from the year before. Crossings also fell between January and February, when they normally increase as the weather gets warmer.\nWhile open border advocates say illegal “immigration” is inevitable, February figures indicate otherwise showing that the flow of illegals is responding to incentives and that enforcement works. If the Great Southern Wall is eventually built the state-by-state savings to tax payers will be enormous.\nLocal Political Rumors: Two Fernandina Beach City Commission seats are up this coming November 7 that are currently occupied by Tim Poynter and Robin Lentz, two of the most level-headed, competent, intelligent folks to ever serve the community. It’s difficult enough to find qualified people to run for an office that pays a lousy 12 grand a year and all the abuse they can handle. Unconfirmed rumors have it that Tim will be opposed by former commissioner, News-Leader left wing columnist, and retired high school indoctrination coordinator Ron “Get off my lawn you little bastards” Sapp, and Robin by former commissioner Sarah Pelican, a member of the Curly, Larry and Moe trio that caused so much havoc in a previous term. Putting Mr. Sapp and Ms. Pelican back on the commission would be like electing two children who put their hands over their ears because they don’t want to listen to Mother. To discuss issues with these two possible candidates voters can practice by holding conversations with five-year-olds.\nKeep Your Distance From This Protestor: One of the organizers of ‘the recent women’s march is fighting deportation from America because she lied about having been convicted of terrorism, it has emerged.\nIn an open letter printed in The Guardian, several authors including ‘Rasmea Yousef Odeh’ called on women across the US to take part in ‘striking, marching, blocking roads’ and other activities in a day of ‘grassroots, anti-capitalist feminism’.\nBut what the letter doesn’t say is that Odeh, 69, was convicted of killing two young men after bombing an Israeli supermarket and now faces deportation from the US for lying about it in her citizenship application.

Out 10th President, John Tyler, who was born in 1790 and took office in 1841 following the death of President William Henry Harrison, has two grandchildren who are still living….NOT great grandchildren, BUT grandchildren. Their father was Tyler’s son Lyon Gardiner Tyler, one of President Tyler’s 15 kids, who was born in 1853. He fathered Lyon Gardiner Tyler, Jr. in 1924 and Harrison Ruffin Tyler in 1928. Harrison Tyler was interviewed by New York Magazine in 2012 and Lyon Tyler was a guest speaker not too long ago at a Daughters of the American Revolution meeting. Also, an interesting piece of history that many may not know about President Tyler is that he was “the only president to commit a public act of treason against the U.S. government.” According to “The Smithsonian Book of Presidential History”: “As president in the early 1840s, Tyler, who was a native Virginian, supported many policies his party did not — states rights and slavery, to name two. Sixteen years after leaving office, when civil war seemed inevitable, Tyler chaired a peace conference between representatives from the North and South with the goal of keeping the Union intact. When the peace efforts he spearheaded failed, Tyler embraced the Confederacy and urged fellow Virginians to join him. He was eventually elected to the Confederate Congress, which was officially at war with the country he once served.” Actually, Tyler died before he had a chance to take a seat in the Confederate Congress. Interesting stuff, I think.\nDrinking, Dining & Dancing: Last week, when listing area pubs with cheap beer prices I failed to mention that the Salty Pelican has all-day $2 Narragansett tall boys. However, the best deal at the Pelican isn’t the two buck beer, but the $8 for a half pound of peel-and-eat shrimp. I’ve been to every eatery on the island and nearby that offer peel-and-eat shrimp and not one compares to the Pelican’s price or plumpness. Halftime’s Lorenzo Church recently introduced me to an All-Day IPA, that comes in a green 19 1/2 ounce can and sells for just $4 all day, every day.

{"id": "206", "text": "Q: How can I remove exhaust stains on the transom and stern area? They don't come off with boat soap or spray cleaners very well.\nA: Exhaust stains can turn a white transom gray and make an otherwise clean boat look dirty. Exhaust stains won’t harm your gel coat, but for cosmetic purposes, it’s something you probably want to keep on top of. However, as many of you know, they don’t always come off in the wash. Some spray cleaners are strong enough to remove exhaust stains, however if they’re strong enough for that job, then they’re probably also strong enough to eventually strip that area of wax, only making it harder to clean the exhaust stains off over time. The only way to remove them at that point is to buff and wax that area. Yes, it’s a vicious circle that you’re on, so how about skipping a step and going straight to the wax.\nThe best way to remove exhaust stains from gel coat is to wax them off. This is something that can easily be done by hand with cleaner wax, such as Meguiars Cleaner Wax. Use any kind of rag to apply the wax with (terry cloth or an old t-shirt) and wipe or rub it in until the exhaust stains are gone. Then use a microfiber rag to wipe the hazy wax dust off. You’ll be left with a nice clean, white surface again and it should be a little easier to wipe exhaust stains off the next time since they’ll be sitting on top of a freshly waxed surface.\nDeckhand Detailing, established in 1990, offers affordable and high quality boat cleaning and detailing services including boat washing, boat buffing and waxing, interior and exterior cleaning and more.

{"id": "207", "text": "L3 Shops for a Shipyard — and a Place in the Defense Industry’s Top Tier\nIts bullish new CEO wants America’s sixth-largest defense firm viewed in the same group as the Big 5.\nL3 Technologies is eying a shipyard as the company deepens its push into the underwater drone market and beyond, Defense One has learned.\nThe move comes as new CEO Christopher Kubasik looks to grow America’s sixth-largest defense company. While Kubasik tiptoed around a question about an expansion into shipbuilding on the company’s quarterly earnings call Tuesday, he made several bullish comments about plans for more acquisitions and growing the firm’s infrastructure.\n“Everything is on the table,” Kubasik said. “If it makes sense, we’ll pursue it.”\nL3 spent more than $300 million on acquisitions in 2017, and expects to top that in 2018, Kubasik said.\nThe company “can easily make $1 billion of acquisitions a year,” he said. “We’ll be happy to do larger acquisitions if they make sense strategically and operationally and financially.”\nL3 is about to be flush with cash. On Tuesday, company officials announced a $540 million sale of its Vertex services business, plus aerospace units Crestview Aerospace and TCS, to a private equity firm. Kubasik said he expects the deal, which will close this summer, to generate $400 million after-tax to be “put to use based on our strategic priorities.”\nL3’s shipyard search was the buzz among at last month’s Navy League Sea-Air-Space conference — the largest maritime trade show in the U.S., held annually in a Washington, D.C., suburb.\nNew York-based L3 has been scooping up companies that specialize in autonomous underwater drone technology. At Sea-Air-Space, it showed off its Iver Precision Workhorse, an autonomous undersea vehicle. A company statement called the sub “the first in a family of advanced, highly capable military AUVs to address a wide variety of customer missions, including multi-domain intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance, anti-submarine warfare, seabed warfare and mine warfare.” The drone is made by OceanServer, which L3 acquired last year. The U.S. Navy alone is expected to invest $3 billion in undersea technology, the Washington Post reported in 2016.\n“The No. 1 way to improve margins in my opinion has always been to increase the denominator and to grow,” Kubasik said Tuesday on the earnings call. “I think volume is the best way to improve your profitability and that’s why we’ve rolled out our disciplined growth strategy and myself and my team and others have been aggressively out there meeting with customers both as a supplier to the primes and directly to the end uses to try to jumpstart the growth.”\nKubasik wants his company, which had 2017 defense revenues of $8.9 billion, viewed alongside the “Big 5”: Lockheed Martin ($43.7 billion), Boeing, Raytheon, Northrop Grumman and General Dynamics ($19.7 billion).\n“Our ultimate goal is to have the scale and capabilities to compete for programs as a non-traditional, sixth price [contractor],” he said.\nL3 is amid a leadership transition. Kubasik took over as CEO in January, but his predecessor, Michael Strianese, remained chairman. Kubasik is poised to become chairman following a vote at a shareholders meeting next Monday.\nIn another sign of its push deeper into the naval market, L3 in January appointed Sean Stackley as corporate vice president of strategic advanced programs and technology. Stackley oversaw the Navy’s acquisition portfolio for more than nine years, and served as acting Navy secretary for more than half of 2017.\n“I think by the end of the calendar year we’ll have the entire team in place and ready to go,” Kubasik said of changes within the firm’s leadership.", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}
{"id": "208", "text": "By Michelle Miao, Talawanda High School\nAmerica, 美国, means “beautiful kingdom” in Chinese, but it’s been increasingly difficult to see much beauty in the country that I was born in and love. Since the start of the pandemic, hate crimes against Asians have spiked, with more than 3,000 reports in the past year alone. The racism has been exacerbated by xenophobic and harmful rhetoric from the highest levels of government. Donald Trump derisively labeled COVID-19 the “China virus” and the “kung flu,” gleefully telling a campaign rally crowd, “I can name 19 different versions of names.” During the height of the crisis, the most powerful person in the country not only made it acceptable to blame and hate us; he encouraged it.\nHowever, racism against people of Asian descent is nothing new; it’s nearly as old as America itself. When Chinese workers first came to America in the mid-19th century, they were exploited for their labor and used to construct railroads across the west, but were shunned by white settlers and barred from becoming citizens. As “yellow peril” swept through the nation, Congress passed the Chinese Exclusionary Act, banning Chinese immigration to America. In 1871, a white mob entered Chinatown and brutally murdered 18 Chinese men and boys in one of the worst lynchings in American history. In this same period, and well into the 20th century, Asian workers in the fish-canning industry faced similar exploitation, discrimination and violence. During World War II, President Roosevelt designated the forced incarceration of over 100,000 Japanese and Japanese-Americans, labeling them all as threats to the nation. In 1989, five elementary school students in California were killed by a gunman in the Stockton shooting, targeted because they were refugees from Vietnam and Cambodia.\nAs a first-generation American, I carry these stories with me. My parents emigrated from China in the hope that their children would find greater opportunity in the United States. As part of an ethnic minority, however, I also have greater understanding of America’s painful past. In the last year, I’ve been lucky enough to avoid racial slurs or other harms. Still, I live in fear that a trip to the grocery store might turn into a confrontation with an ignorant stranger. I worry constantly that my ten-year-old sister might be bullied at school, called “coronavirus” or accused of bringing the pandemic to America.\nAsians tend to be perceived as a docile, quiet minority group. I get that; it’s in our community culture to minimize the harassment we face. We’re unused to speaking up about the pain of racism, and in many instances, we have felt the bitterness of our experiences being ignored or diminished. Even among the Asian people I know, there’s oftentimes a feeling of inevitability surrounding racism. Sure, a certain experience was horrible and unfortunate, but it was a misunderstanding that we should brush off and move on from.\nThis attitude has to change. Increasing Asian visibility and amplifying Asian voices should be a top priority in combatting hate. To begin with, the word “Asian” describes a huge community of people from (or generations removed from) a plethora of countries sprawling across half the globe, and covers a vast socio-economic range in America. Far from being the shining “model minority” of pop-culture stereotypes, Asian-Americans actually have a higher poverty rate than white households, and many new and first-generation immigrants face dismal standards of living.\nThe shootings in Atlanta draw our attention to low-income Asian immigrants who work at massage parlors, spas, and other jobs that put Asian workers at extra risk of sexual and racial discrimination. The Atlanta shooter claimed a “sex addiction” in defense of the massacre, denying he had any racial motive. Common sense tells us that he knew exactly whose lives he would be ending when he walked through the doors of Young’s Asian Massage. Moreover, his outlet for sex points to the lens of Orientalism, through which Westerners reduce Asian women to exotic sexual objects. The shooting shows every characteristic of an anti-Asian hate crime.\nAfter every shooting or attack on minorities, America expresses shock and dismay and jumps to take action in ways that seek to alleviate symptoms without addressing the underlying diseases of racism, misogyny, and hatred. As a member of the Asian-American community, I’ve been tensely following reports of Asian hate crimes for the past year—a father and his children stabbed at the store, an elderly Asian man shoved down on the street, a Filipino man slashed across the face with a box cutter. Along this vein, the Atlanta shooting was almost predictable.\nIn its aftermath, I fervently hope that this marks a turning point. There isn’t a quick solution to resolving anti-Asian hatred. It means dismantling centuries of discrimination and violent oppression, but it can start with paying attention to the lasting effects of this history in today’s society. We must recognize and call out casual scapegoating of the Asian community. We must educate ourselves and others about America’s history of discrimination against people of Asian descent, have difficult conversations, and support the Asian community, because as long as one minority faces discrimination, no one can truly be free.\nWe also need the advocacy and support of our elected officials, who have the power to bring the Asian community out of the shadows. This week’s House hearing on anti-Asian discrimination was the first in three decades; it was both a necessary start and yet not enough. History will continue to repeat itself until the Asian community and its allies mobilize. By targeting the common enemy of systemic white supremacy, we can transform our grief and horror into meaningful action.

Access will be maintained for residents in the first stage of work between Water Lane and Higher Cadewell Lane.\nThe work is expected to take in total around seven weeks to complete. Access to Torbay Hospital will not be affected from the Newton Road direction.\nThe letter to residents explains that because of the type of work being done in the second section, vehicle access to properties in that section of the road will have to be closed but there will be pedestrian access at all times.\nResidents will need to find alternative options for parking. As they live in a controlled parking zone they have to get permits to use nearby streets.\nBuilder and decorator Chris Earnshaw, of 52 Cadewell Lane said he needed daily access to his property for his tools and equipment.\n“The highways department said to me if your car is not out at the beginning you will not be able to get out for five weeks.

It is anticipated that the works will take approximately seven weeks to complete and will be carried out in two sections, commencing at Water Lane moving down to Higher Cadewell Lane.\n“During this time a section of Cadewell Lane from Higher Cadewell Lane towards Torbay Hospital will remain open to traffic and buses and access to properties will be unaffected. Once completed, the works will move to the second section from Higher Cadewell Lane to Cadewell Park Road.\n“Pedestrian access will be maintained at all times, however due to the type of work necessary to rebuild the road, for the second section, access for vehicles to properties cannot be maintained and residents will need to find alternative options for parking.\n“Part of this road and surrounding roads are situated in the Controlled Parking Zone E.

Fortunately for us, he posts images and video captured by those lenses he finds to YouTube.\nAnd this particular lens is a beauty. A Carl Zeiss Kipronar 120mm f/1.9 projector lens which cost him only $70. It’s fixed wide open at f/1.9 and was never meant to be used for shooting photos. But Mathieu was able to adapt it. He says the closest he could find to a modern equivalent of this lens is the $7,000 Leica APO-Macro_Summarit-S F2.5/120mm.\nIt’s a cheap lens, but it’s very rare, and you have to be a boss at manual focusing. About the lens, Mathieu notes…\n- It’s heavy as hell\n- There is no aperture, so you shoot at f/1.9 all the time\n- The focus helicoid is at the base of the lens, not the tip\n- At f/1.8 it’s extremely hard to nail focus on video\nMathieu describes it as being very sharp in the centre which gets swirly as you head out toward the edges. But you need to be a master at manual focusing.\nIt’s a very cool look, although Mathieu says don’t ask him for an Amazon link to buy it. They’re not made any more and it’s rare.\nSo, if you want one, get hunting.\nJohn Aldred is a photographer with over 20 years of experience in the portrait and commercial worlds.

Translation is the best resource to overcome administrative frontiers and to allow knowledge across different cultures, languages and literatures.\nThat way, there will be no more frontiers; the texts of European “classics” will be accessible, even in the oldest editions (princepes and even in facsimile), which may prove inaccessible or prohibitive, and, besides, European “classics”, duly translated, will be available to all readers. We can provide these polyglot editions with “appendixes” that will make them especially interesting for scholars: concords, stemming, frequency indexes, vocabularies, glossaries, multimedia elements, educational resources, etc. All in all, we have to create cultural products marked by the excellence of their contents, authors or researchers, which prove to be suitable for the specialist public and, at the same time, for the general public.

{"id": "226", "text": "source：china daily global editor：zhang wenni\ntraders react on the floor of the new york stock exchange as a screen shows us federal reserve board chairman jerome powell during a news conference following a fed rate announcement, in new york city, us, july 27, 2022. [photo/agencies]\nthe latest interest-rate increase by the us federal reserve should provide a clearer picture of how much impact the extra cash sloshing around in the economy from covid-19 pandemic stimulus has had on inflation.\nthe central bank raised its benchmark overnight interest rate by three-quarters of a percentage point (75 basis points) on wednesday in an effort to cool the most intense burst of inflation since the 1980s, with \"ongoing increases\" in borrowing costs still ahead despite some signs of a slowing economy.\n\"inflation remains elevated, reflecting supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic, higher food and energy prices, and broader price pressures,\" the federal open market committee (fomc) said as it lifted its policy rate to a range of between 2.25 percent and 2.50 percent in a unanimous vote. the fomc did note, however, that \"recent indicators of spending and production have softened\".\nthe american economy is still working through pent-up demand from covid-19-related suppression of economic activity. that demand also was heightened by global supply chain backlogs, which led to fewer goods on shelves.\ncoupled with trillions of dollars in the government’s pandemic-stimulus funding, demand is still making its way through the proverbial python.\nin march, the federal reserve bank of san francisco estimated that government stimulus may have added three percentage points to the national inflation rate.\n\"inflation is leading to record-low consumer sentiment, but consumers are still spending,\" wrote greg daco, chief economist at ey-parthenon, adding that the us economy is currently \"a world of paradox\".\n\"since the onset of the pandemic, lawmakers have spent about $6 trillion on various income-support programs for households and businesses,\" wrote donald luskin, chief investment officer of trendmacro, in a piece in the wall street journal.\n\"that all dropped straight into the bank accounts that are part of m2, which also grew about $6 trillion over precisely the same period.\"\nm2 is cash in circulation along with liquid bank and money-market fund balances.\nluskin quoted famed economist milton friedman who said that \"inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon\".\ngrowth in m2 peaked at an astronomical 27 percent in february 2021, but has been falling since, luskin said.\none area where higher interest rates have an immediate impact is the housing market.\nsigned contracts for the purchase of existing homes plunged 20 percent in june compared with a year ago, the national association of realtors (nar) said wednesday.\npending home sales also fell 8.6 percent in june from may, far more than expected.\nthe interest rate on 30-year mortgages has recently averaged 5.54 percent, according to freddie mac, chartered by congress in 1970 to support the us housing finance system.\n\"contract signings to buy a home will keep tumbling down as long as mortgage rates keep climbing, as has happened this year to date,\" said lawrence yun, chief economist for nar.\nthe fed has raised its policy interest rate by 225 basis points this year as it battles a 1980s-level breakout of inflation — with that decade’s approach to monetary policy.\nwith the most recent consumer price index data showing prices rising at more than 9 percent, investors expect the fed to raise rates by at least a half-percentage point at its september meeting.\n\"i don’t think the economy is in recession right now,\" federal reserve chair jerome powell said wednesday at a post-fomc meeting news conference.\npowell repeatedly said that the fed’s target goal for inflation is 2 percent.\n\"the economy and the country have been through a lot over the past two and a half years and have proved resilient. it is essential that we bring inflation down to our 2 percent goal if we are to have a sustained period of strong labor market conditions that benefit all,\" powell said.\nsalman ahmed, global head of macro for fidelity international in london told reuters: \"the continued focus on inflation and labor-market strength was striking in the press conference comments as the two main drivers behind the pace of hiking. we think a significant slowdown is already in the pipeline and will start to show in hard data in the coming weeks and months.\n\"however, continued strength in the labor market — with only very tentative signs of some easing in demand and supply pressures — and the fed’s focus on lagging hard data means another 75bp hike is possible at the next meeting. the risk here is that the fed tightens policy too far too quickly, making a hard landing inevitable.\"\nseema shah, chief global strategist at principal global investors, wrote that \"with the labor market still a picture of strength, wage growth still uncomfortably high and core inflation set to decline at a glacially slow pace, the fed certainly cannot stop tightening, nor can it downshift gears too much\".\nbrian coulton, chief economist at fitch ratings, said, \"the fed’s statement acknowledged the recent softening in activity data but this is given short shrift in the presence of what is still a very robust labor market and unrelenting inflation pressures.\n\"given where core inflation and the unemployment rate (3.6 percent) currently stand, this underscores that monetary policy adjustment still has quite a long way to go. market expectations that the fed may be cutting rates again next year look premature.\"\ngina chon, a columnist for reuters’ breaking views, wondered if powell could face political ramifications from the rapid rate increases.\n\"what’s the cost if powell pushes too far? for him, not much. he can’t be removed, short of misconduct, until 2028. he also has broad backing from congress. powell was reconfirmed in his current role in may by 80 of the 99 senators who voted,\" she wrote.\n\"he has also schmoozed more effectively than other fed chiefs. in his first year as chair in 2018, he had nearly 100 meetings with members of congress, while his predecessor, janet yellen, had 22 such gatherings, according to their public calendars.\"\nchon added though that \"politicians can pester fed chiefs in other ways\".\nshe mentioned paul volcker, who presided over a 19 percent effective federal funds rate and two recessions in the 1980s and faced several resolutions in congress demanding his impeachment.\nreuters contributed to this story.", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4,

{"id": "231", "text": "State-regulated online gambling has slowly spread throughout many Canadian provinces over the last few years. In 2010, Ontario declared its intent to launch an online casino in the region, but it’s taken all this time to reach fruition. Last week, PlayOLG finally went live with its province-wide hard launch.\nA press release from the Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corporation (OLG) went out on January 8, 2015, to announce the highly anticipated launch of PlayOLG. Previously, the Canadian online casino was only available to “eligible members of the OLG Winner’s Circle Rewards program”, who participated in an exhaustive beta-testing phase during the soft launch period.\nOntarians of legal age now have access to a modest assortment of online gambling amusements. The initial hard launch comes with 21 graphically rich video slots and 8 table games. Ontarian gamblers will find popular titles like Blackjack, Fast Poker (3 card poker), Mini Baccarat, Sic Bo, War and 3 Roulette variations; American Roulette, European Roulette and Roulette Supreme. The website details the addition of five-card video poker amusements “coming soon”.\nMembers of PlayOLG will also be able to secure the purchase of state lottery tickets, including LOTTO 6/49 and LOTTO MAX, as well as adding ENCORE numbers to those tickets.\n“We are excited to launch PlayOLG,” said Vice President of OLG John Wisternoff, commending the launch as, “an important milestone in the modernization of gaming in Ontario.” Wisternoff went on to extoll the player protections now offered by the new online casino. “For Ontarians who love the excitement of gaming, PlayOLG offers a safe and regulated alternative to grey market websites.”\nThe announcement came with the delineation of the PlayOLG’s superior customer support services. A dedicated support team has been locally employed by Ontario officials (no unintelligible accents here) to deliver 24/7 assistance via toll-free telephone, live chat support and email.\nOLG briefly touched on the subject of the lengthy delays involved in the launch of its provincial online casino website by detailing the commission’s efforts to ensure the maintenance of responsible gambling practices. According to the press release, PlayOLG has a number of Responsible Gambling (RG) tools embedded directly into the software. Those tools were developed to integrate “Canadian and global best practices” after extensive research involving addiction specialists, professional research consultants and investors.\nThe RG programs installed by the OLG have received international acclaim, including reception of the World Lottery Association (WLA) Best Overall Responsible Gambling Program Award in November of 2014. Such safeguards include the exemption of anonymous players, age/identity verification upon registration, mandatory deposit/loss/play-time limitations, customized in-game RG messaging systems, self-exclusion options and more.\nOne unique aspect of the Canadian online casino is that if a player wishes to increase their spending limits, upon request, they must undergo a 7-day cooling off period in which they cannot access the real-money games. Players also have access to a complete history of their online casino account, and parents will find a multitude of tips on how to prevent their children from accessing PlayOLG or any other online gambling websites.\nIt’s been estimated that half a million Ontarians have been spending $400-$500 million at offshore, “grey market” gambling websites. The provincial launch of PlayOLG now puts Ontario on par with other Canadian territories that have previously introduced legal, state-regulated online casinos, including British Columbia, Manitoba, Quebec, and the Atlantic Provinces of New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island.", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

But that is the plan.”\nWhile the NRMA is yet to announce pricing for its electric-car fast chargers, Ms Irving-Dolan said it aims to be ‘competitive’ compared to other companies – while discounts for NRMA members and fleet/business operators could also be on the cards.\nFor context, Evie and Chargefox – which is now owned by a consortium of Australia’s motoring clubs, including the NRMA – charge 40 cents per kilowatt-hour (kWh) for electric-car drivers to use their 50kWh fast-chargers.\nBy requiring electric-car owners to pay to use the chargers, the NRMA aims to both reduce the number of people using the facilities – leading to shorter queues – while funding further upgrades to its charging network.\nIn April 2023, the NRMA announced it would partner with the Australian Government to spend $78.6 million on funding an additional 117 fast-charging locations around the country – not just in New South Wales.\nAs the NRMA aims to start making electric-car drivers pay for its fast-chargers, energy firm AGL has announced it will offer discounted rates to certain customers who use oil giant BP’s ‘Pulse’ charging stations.\nIn a media statement, the three-year agreement – which will run from July 2023 until 2026 – will allow AGL customers in New South Wales who purchase its ‘EV (electric-vehicle) home energy plan’ to receive discounted charging rates at BP Pulse sites.\nNeither AGL or BP Pulse provided details about how much of a discount customers would receive, instead claiming the program will align with BP’s plans to open 600 recharging points in \"key metropolitan and regional BP retail locations along Australia’s east coast\".\nAt present, there are approximately 30 BP Pulse electric-car charging stations in Australia, located in New South Wales, Victoria and Brisbane – largely along major highways or in metropolitan areas.", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}
{"id": "236", "text": "We’ve created a list of the 5 best job interview tips for truck drivers to follow. With so many different companies to choose from, knowing how to prepare yourself for the trucking job market can be difficult—read more to make your next interview a success and make the next step in your career.\n1. Recognize the Questions & Match Them to Your Experience\nThis is the best job interview tip for truck drivers and many other careers for a reason. The more familiar you are with common questions asked in trucking interviews, the more prepared you can be to answer them thoughtfully, thoroughly, and with regards to your previous experience. Here are some interview questions specifically related to truck driving that you should reflect upon when practicing for your next interview:\n- Where have you travelled to in your trucking career? Are you more familiar with certain areas and regions than others?\n- How do you plan out your trucking routes in advance? What are the steps you take to travel the most efficient routes possible?\n- What is the longest haul you have had to make as a truck driver? How did you manage to keep your focus while also fulfilling your duties on time?\n- What identification, paperwork, or time logs do you keep on-hand while trucking?\n- Have you ever had an accident while on the road? If so, how were you able to handle the situation calmly and effectively?\nThough these are far from the only questions you’ll be expected to answer, they are a great starting point for knowing what to expect from your next truck driving interview.\n2. Be Familiar With Unexpected Trucking Scenarios\nReflecting on your experience in the truck driving industry can help you respond to tough situations that may come up while on the road. In truck driving interviews, you’ll likely be asked how you have handled unexpected scenarios in a fast and efficient manner. Some example scenarios that you can use to begin reflecting on your own experience include:\n- Imagine a situation where you were running late on a delivery due to a traffic jam or a mistake in your route. How could you maintain safe and legal driving standards while preserving your quality customer service?\n- What would you do in a scenario where you were involved in an accident caused by another driver?\n- In a situation where your truck needed maintenance while on the road, what forms of basic maintenance could you provide? What are maintenance problems that you would need to contact outside help for?\nIf you are new to the world of truck driving, it may be difficult for you to think of what you may do in an unexpected scenario while in the field. This is why it is important to do additional research on the truck driving lifestyle and the many experiences of more seasoned veterans in the trucking industry. You can visit our blog to read more about the kinds of situations you may encounter on the road, as well as lifestyle tips for truckers new and old.\n3. Know Your Truck Driving Record and How to Discuss It\nThough there are some companies willing to take newly licensed drivers on the road, many trucking companies are looking to hire drivers with at least some field experience. Interviewers like to interview candidates with consistently successful driving records, including no previous accidents and an accurate record of on-time deliveries. However, even if you have some less positive marks on your driving record, you can still speak to your experience in becoming a better driver through the difficult scenarios you have faced. If you need help learning about how to talk about your truck driving experience, consider how you demonstrate the top qualities of a good truck driver so you can speak confidently about your professional record in your next interview.\n4. Research the Trucking Company — Know Their Cargo\nTo excel in a trucking interview, you want to demonstrate to your interviewer that you have carefully considered their company and are familiar with what your specific role as a driver would be like for their company. Depending on the breadth of your experience in the trucking field, you may be looking for a company that specializes in shipping a specific type of cargo with policies and general protocols that you’re already familiar with. If you’re looking into a company whose cargo is less related to your previous experience, you’ll want to do additional research on any certificates or training you may need to carry certain cargo. Check out our list of partnered trucking companies to get a head start on the many company options you have to continue your career on the road.\n5. Ask Questions About Trucking for the Company\nJust as the company you’re interviewing with wants to know if you’re the right candidate for the job, you want to ensure that the company you’re interviewing with can meet your needs and expectations as a truck driver. Though you won’t want to ask equally as many questions as you are given, there are some key questions for you to keep in mind as you consider your future career:\n- What is your home time policy for your company’s drivers?\n- Does your company pay the commercial truck insurance required for my work vehicle?\n- What is your company-’s fueling policy?\n- Does your company pay drivers on an hourly basis, or per-mile?\n- As a driver for your company, how and when will my performance and progress be measured?\n- Are your company’s truckers also responsible for the loading and unloading of cargo?\nLooking to Start Your Truck Driving Career?

{"id": "239", "text": "Non-Prescription Treatments For Psoriasis Flare-Ups\nIn Part One of this article, we discussed non-prescription treatments for psoriasis. There are several things your doctor can and should check, including food allergies and medication side effects. There are also non-prescription treatments offered at our holistic clinic that you may not have tried. But I also get asked, “What can I do at home to prevent psoriasis flare-ups?”\nWhat Else Can I Do To Help Psoriasis Flare-Ups?\nGet Some Sun\nSunshine (or perhaps the vitamin D it gives us) seems to help calm psoriasis. Perhaps it’s part of the calming effect of nature, which reduces stress. Certainly getting out in nature in the sunshine can help. If you’re using a coal tar treatment for psoriasis, be aware that it can cause you to sunburn more easily, so be extra careful not to overexpose your skin to sunlight for too long.\nSpeaking of reducing stress, any methods you can use to limit stress in your life can be helpful. Put off stressful decisions, avoid people who seem to increase the stress in your life, and perhaps cut back your on-the-job activities for a bit. Meditation, mindfulness, yoga, Tai Chi, deep breathing and other forms of stress reduction can be helpful. Better sleep helps reduce stress, of course, but it can be a struggle when you’re dealing with a severe case of psoriasis.\nAnother way to relieve stress and help your skin directly is increasing the number of warm (not hot) baths you take. Try an Epsom salt or oatmeal bath, or a bath oil that contains aloe vera or jojoba to help keep your skin moist. Daily 20 minute baths are recommended.\nKeeping your skin moist can be helpful for most psoriasis. Try a pure aloe vera or jojoba gel or cream.\nWork On Your Self Talk\nBeating up on yourself isn’t going to help your skin – quite the opposite is true. This is a good time to go easy on yourself and rein in any inclinations to be self-critical. If this is a big struggle for you, counselling can help quite quickly.\nStop Smoking, Limit Alcohol\nEat More Fatty Fish\nFatty fish such as salmon, sardines, cod, trout, and others give your body anti-inflammatory omega-3s, which have been linked to reducing inflammation.\nCheck Your Humidity\nIn dry climates, a humidifier can help. Humidity between 30 and 50 percent is recommended by the Mayo Clinic.\nTry Some (Good Quality) Supplements\nFish oil, vitamin D, vitamin B-12, and selenium have all been linked to reducing inflammation. One study showed good results with Oregon Grape supplements. Our office can advise on specific types and brands.\nWork With Your Doctor\nIt’s important to understand that a serious and persistent case with frequent psoriasis flare-ups may not be something you can handle at home on your own. Working with a holistic practice like ours can help you with the allergy testing, treatments, and dietary management to help you reduce incidents and help you live more comfortably.", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}

{"id": "241", "text": "On ADA’s 31st Anniversary, Duckworth Speaks at FDR Memorial Wreath Laying and Calls for Accessibility and Inclusion\n[WASHINGTON, D.C.] – As our nation marks the 31st anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) today, U.S. Senator Tammy Duckworth (D-IL) joined U.S. Representative Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-DC) as well as members of the FDR Memorial Legacy Committee’s Advisory Board at the FDR Memorial to honor President Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s leadership as the first known United States President with a significant physical disability and highlight the importance of disability representation and the work we must do to achieve full accessibility and inclusion. Video of the Senator’s remarks can be found here.\n“While we’ve come a long way since the ink dried on the ADA 31 years ago, we still have a long way to go to make this country truly accessible for Americans with disabilities, including at National Parks like the FDR Memorial, on our transportation systems and more,” said Duckworth. “From updating illegible braille text on the walls of this memorial to passing my ASAP Act to help make our transit stations more accessible, all of our laws should safeguard every American’s constitutionally-enshrined rights, rather than punishing the very people whom our country has already discriminated against for too long. I was proud to join Congresswoman Norton and the FDR Memorial Legacy Committee’s Advisory Board to mark this important day in our nation’s history for disability rights, and I look forward to continuing our work to bring about a tomorrow where we won’t have to work so hard just to live our daily lives.”\nEarlier this year, Duckworth and Norton introduced a resolution recognizing the successful campaign led by disability advocates to secure a statue of FDR in a wheelchair in the Prologue Room at the FDR Memorial and urging the National Park Service (NPS) to make the memorial accessible to everyone by installing tactile braille throughout the space and supporting the development of accessible education materials for visitors. In May, Duckworth introduced her All Stations Accessibility Program Act to help make public transportation systems more accessible to passengers with disabilities.\nThis week, Duckworth sent a letter to U.S. Secretary of the Interior Haaland urging the National Park Service to take action to make the FDR Memorial fully accessible to blind or visually impaired.\nFull text of the letter can be found here and below:\nJuly 26, 2021\nThe Honorable Deb Haaland\nSecretary of Interior\nDepartment of Interior\n1849 C Street, NW\nWashington DC 20240\nDear Secretary Haaland:\nI write today regarding the inaccessibility of the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial (FDR Memorial) for people with disabilities and to respectfully request the National Park Service (NPS) address the numerous accessibility issues, which have lasted for decades, in time for the memorial’s 25th anniversary on May 2, 2022.\nA recent report by Dr. Cheryl Fogle-Hatch outlines a number of ways in which the FDR Memorial fails to meet accessibility standards, particularly for people who are blind or visually impaired. Dr. Fogle-Hatch explains in detail how the FDR Memorial falls short in providing accessible options, including:\n- the NPS website failing to provide brochures with updated Unified English Braille (UEB);\n- the memorial not displaying legible Braille on the walls of the memorial; and\n- the lack of protective barriers that are of proper height for blind individuals.\nFurthermore, there is evidence that these issues have been longstanding as they were highlighted in The Washington Post article, “FDR Memorial's Braille Letters Pose Sizable Problem for Blind” as early as 1997. To these shortcomings, Dr. Fogle-Hatch’s report provides detailed and straight-forward recommendations for improvement. Further, without these modifications, the NPS is failing to uphold the very values that promote disability rights enshrined in the Prologue Room at the FDR Memorial itself.\nI have introduced Senate Resolution 86 (S.Res.86) to call for the recommitment of the United States to the promotion of disability rights and to the values enshrined in the Prologue Room of the FDR Memorial. This resolution calls on NPS and the National Park Foundation to continue to increase access to the FDR Memorial for individuals with disabilities and to support the development of accessible educational materials.\nIt is past due that NPS honor the needs of the disabled community and make the FDR Memorial fully accessible. I urge the NPS to move swiftly to incorporate the recommendations of Dr. Fogle-Hatch at the FDR Memorial to improve accessibility. Specifically, I urge NPS to facilitate the following:\n- the creation of a mobile guide accessible by smartphones to allow individuals with disabilities to use their own preferred accessibility settings;\n- update the FDR Memorial’s brochure to conform to current UEB code and include a descriptive layout of the Memorial;\n- add wayside interpretive panels in print and UEB code around the Memorial; and\n- install guardrails around the in-ground fountain in Room One that are no higher than 27 inches, in order to allow the barrier to be detected by a standard white cane.\nWhile we’ve come closer to having true representation for our community at this memorial, we will never truly reach that milestone until every American can access and enjoy it. Incorporating these recommendations would illustrate NPS’s commitment to civil rights and allegiance to creating public spaces to be enjoyed by all Americans.\nSeveral disability organizations have been fighting for accessibility at our Nation’s parks and memorials for decades, highlighting that this is an important and pressing issue for the disability community. As the 25th anniversary of the dedication of the FDR Memorial Prologue Room approaches, I am confident we will find a path forward in addressing these issues. I understand that some recent efforts and planning have been initiated for this Memorial, I look forward to hearing what those are. I deeply appreciate your urgent consideration of these recommendations, and I look forward to your commitment to improving accessibility at the FDR Memorial.\nNext Article Previous Article", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}

{"id": "249", "text": "Anyone can develop eczema, no matter your age. It can start out as a red patch that is itchy, probably on your knees, neck, or elbows. Living with eczema can be a real challenge. Another name for eczema is atopic dermatitis. Symptoms include red patches or darker patches of skin, redness, itchiness, and more.\nIt turns out that aloe vera can be good and one of the best solutions for treating eczema and providing relief from symptoms. Massaging aloe vera on your skin can provide immediate relief. Aloe vera happens to be helpful where a lot of different skin disorders are concerned, and it is regularly recommended by holistic doctors.\nAbout Aloe Vera\nAloe vera is an edible succulent plant often used as décor both indoors and out that produces a gel and latex underneath its skin that is yellowish in color. It can also be used for medicinal purposes, including to treat eczema, psoriasis, sunburns, and even frostbite! Latex from the aloe vera plant is a great laxative with no adverse side effects. You can also use aloe vera as a makeup remover and to treat minor burns.\nHow Does Aloe Vera Treat Eczema?\nThere is a gel inside the leaves of aloe vera that can be extracted to treat eczema and psoriasis and so much more. Eczema often causes skin inflammation that is itchy, but aloe vera is anti-inflammatory, so most people see relief in as little as 24 hours when using it.\nAloe vera has been used since ancient times as a great moisturizer because it prevents the skin from losing moisture and hydrates at the same time. Weather changes, eating a food you are allergic to, or coming into contact with certain materials can all cause a flare-up of eczema. But aloe vera for eczema can calm down that irritating flare-up almost immediately.\nWhile aloe vera is not a cure for eczema or other skin disorders it can make living with these conditions more tolerable and lead to fewer symptoms and flare-ups.\nHow to Use Aloe Vera for Eczema\nThere are so many ways you can use aloe vera for eczema but below are some of our favorite methods.\nAloe Vera and Rosewater\nYou will need 1 tablespoon of rose water and 1 tablespoon of aloe vera. Mix the two ingredients together to form a type of paste before applying to the area of skin that is affected. Leave on the skin for ten minutes before washing it off with cold water. You can repeat this method twice a day for relief.\nAloe Vera and Fuller’s Earth\nYou will need 1 tablespoon of aloe vera gel, 1 tablespoon fuller’s earth, and you can use 1 teaspoon of milk or rosewater. You mix the ingredients into a paste and slather it onto the affected skin. Leave it on the skin for 15 minutes and then use a clean, wet cloth to wipe it off. You can use this aloe vera for eczema method daily.\nAloe Vera, Coconut Oil, and Turmeric\nYou will need 1 teaspoon of coconut oil, 2 tablespoons of aloe vera gel, and 1 teaspoon of turmeric. Mix the turmeric and aloe vera together well before adding liquid coconut oil. Apply the paste to the affected skin and let it stay there for 10 minutes before washing it off with cold water. This is a very effective method for treating eczema and psoriasis.\nAloe Vera and Banana\nYou will need one banana and 2 tablespoons of aloe vera gel. Mix the banana and aloe vera gel in a blender. Apply to the affected skin and leave for 10 minutes before washing it off with lukewarm water. Do this daily to provide nourishment to your skin.\nAloe vera has many uses and one of the best uses is for eczema and other skin disorders. These methods are proven to improve life with eczema and provide relief from the symptoms.\nGet Relief from Frustrating Skin Problems\nWhen it comes to finding a good, natural soap we have taken the hard work out of the search - our natural bar soaps were designed by eczema sufferers but are ideal for all skin types!

{"id": "250", "text": "Today’s freakout comes to us from the comments section of the The Washington Post piece “Amicus brief on empirical data about school vouchers”. The article itself explains Douglas County, Colorado’s school voucher pilot program, which allows up to 500 students (out of 66,000 in the district) to receive an education voucher.\nThe ACLU of Colorado sued to stop the voucher program, won in state district court, and lost in the Colorado Court of Appeals. Now, the Colorado Supreme Court will hear the case.\nAlso discussed in the article were responses to the claims made in amicus briefs filed by opponents of school choice programs, including the National Education Association and the American Federation of Teachers. Ultimately, the comments section was full of spirited discussion of how people personally would determine the program’s constitutionality. This post caught our attention:\nFirst, it’s important to know that the Douglas County School Board created the pilot voucher program. The board members, who were elected by voters in their district to represent the needs of the community, were confident in the quality of their public schools for most kids, but recognized some students are bound to learn better in a different educational setting.\nOne of Mr. Lathrop’s main concerns was whether every student, no matter what school they choose to attend, is eligible to use a voucher. The Douglas County voucher program is actually one of the most equitable in the country as far as eligibility goes. For the program law’s jurisdiction, which is only Douglas County, every student who attends a public school is eligible for a voucher. Students who are already enrolled in private school are not eligible.\nPublic school students cannot get voucher funds to use for their education if they remain in a public school, however. If that were to happen, those students would be double-funded – once in public school per-pupil funding and once in the form of voucher dollars – while the students who used their vouchers to attend an independent school would be half as funded as students in public schools. So to clarify, vouchers are not extra money people get to use on top of what the state funds district schools. They are a device for distributing existing education funds differently.\nTo understand the way the program works now, imagine every public school student in the district gets a “voucher.” The kids who stay enrolled in their public school? Their vouchers go to their public school of choice. The kids who switch to an independent school? Their vouchers, which are worth less money than kids who stay in public school, go to their independent school of choice. If a dollar amount is a measure of how much education one receives, the Douglas County voucher program actually does not incentivize people to attend private schools.\nThis concept brings us to Mr. Lathrop’s next concern – that the program’s main purpose is to give private schools money and create a cycle of tuition inflation at the expense of taxpayers.\nTo say, “No, the purpose of the program is to help kids who are struggling in their zoned public school to get the best education for their needs,” isn’t enough to dispute Mr. Lathrop’s claim. So let’s follow his logic to see what would really be likely to happen.\nIf private schools were to raise tuition rates in direct response to vouchers, they run the huge risk of losing the families who already pay out of pocket. Worse even, if they raise rates too far above the value of a voucher, the families who need the financial assistance of a voucher won’t be able to afford to make up the difference to attend their schools anyway. So where will those students go? They’ll be forced to attend the cheaper option, which will almost certainly be their tuition-free public school. Then, all parties are back at square one…only private schools would be worse off because they would have lost potential voucher student enrollment and some of their existing non-voucher students.\nAgain, even if the Douglas County voucher program were private school-centric (which it’s not), inflating tuition rates simply would not be in the best interest of private schools. That is probably why, in our experience, we’ve seen most private school leaders accept the voucher amount as a student’s tuition fee, offer additional financial aid, or work with parents to set a feasible payment plan for any leftover fees.\nIn the end, school voucher programs, especially one led by the public school district itself, are hardly anti-public school. Neither is the district attempting to isolate itself from students from neighboring towns by implementing an optional voucher program. Douglas County actually allows open enrollment among their public schools, so students from outside their district can attend their schools. But ultimately, the Douglas County School Board only has jurisdiction over the students who live in Douglas County. If the answer to making the voucher program more inclusive were creating a statewide voucher program that is open for students from all districts to use their voucher flexibly at any type of school or educational service – public, charter, private, virtual, blended, home, or otherwise – we’d be thrilled!\nAnd if you think that’s a more fair way of doing things, then you might have just realized you are, in fact, a school choice supporter.", "scores": {"score": 3, "score_transform_1": 5, "score_transform_2": 5, "score_transform_3": 0}}

They also alleged that the AIIMS authorities were not providing hostel accommodation to paramedical students.\nAnurag Kumar, Treasurer of OSA, who was present at the meeting with the Dean of the institute, along with other officials on August 22, said that their main demand regarding the provision of hostel accommodation that was earlier mentioned in the prospectuses of batches before 2020, has now been accepted. “Even legal action was going to be taken against us for protesting but that has also been withdrawn by the administration,” he added.\nOne of the other demands of the students was to provide monetary compensation to the family of Abhishek Malviya. The institute, in its letter, agreed to the demand and stated that they would submit a proposal to the competent authority for consideration.\nStudents who were involved in the protest had also expressed concern that they would lose out on attendance during this period. However, Kumar said that the administration has assured them that it would be compensated with extra working hours. Additionally, the institute also approved the grant of vacation.\nHere is a quick rundown of the students’ demands:\n1. Monetary compensation to Abhishek Malviya’s family\n2. Hostel accommodation for students who have opted for Optometry\n3. Compensation of attendance for period of absence during protest\n4. Withdraw show cause notices issued to members of OSA\n5. Filling of vacant rooms in the hostel\nThis copy will be updated once a response is received from the AIIMS administration.", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

It will also capture energy from braking like a traditional hybrid and feature an on-board engine as a backup generator to send power to the battery on trips over 40 miles.\nEnvironmental advocates have pushed for the development of such \"plug-in\" vehicles to cut oil consumption and vehicle emissions. The technology could also help GM meet higher federal fuel economy standards, representatives have said.\nLutz said GM engineers were working on how to smooth the power handoff from the Volt's battery to the on-board engine, something designed to kick in as the battery is depleted.\n\"It all works real well, it's just that the transition from battery power to the internal combustion,\" Lutz said. \"They said it's still noisy and it's a little rough. But heck, we've got a little more than a year and a half to work on that.\"\nWhen asked, Lutz said GM was near naming a supplier for the closely watched contract, but declined to comment further.\nToyota has said it will start producing lithium ion batteries through a joint venture with Japan's Matsushita Electric Industrial Co Ltd in 2009. The automaker, which has eclipsed GM as the world's largest by sales volume, plans to roll out a plug-in hybrid for fleet customers in 2010.\nBut Lutz said Toyota deserved more scrutiny for its earlier, apparent dismissal of lithium-ion battery technology at the time GM announced the Volt a year and a half ago.\n\"They told the world that GM was taking a huge risk, that lithium ion batteries were prone to explode and that we were putting our customers at risk and that they would stay with the tried and true,\" he said. \"When it comes to Toyota, let me tell you, the press has a short memory.\"", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}

Maybe the pandemic brought this awareness on early. One thought has dominated my thoughts: you have limited time, limited paths and adventures, limited experiences and emotions to feel. Will you continue your life as it is, slowly floating down the lazy-river of milestones—college, job, wedding, kids, retirement, death—or will you dive into the icy water and swim somewhere unknown?\n“Tell me, what is it you plan to do with your one wild and precious life?” ~ Mary Oliver\nOnce you’ve had the realization that your journey is ending sometime between now and 50 years from now, the lens becomes black and white. The little voice in your head ramps up the tension: stay with the safe path you’ve chosen, or move to Costa Rica and start a sloth sanctuary? Dream within the current structure of your life, or scare yourself with bigger, grander visions of what your life could be?\nThe questions that arise can be alarming:\n>> Will I ever fall in love again?\n>> Will I ever travel somewhere and have an adventure by myself?\n>> Will I ever fulfill my potential in my career?\n>> Will I reach self-actualization and stop doubting myself once and for all?\n>> Will I make enough of an impact on this world?\n>> Will I write my book?\n>> Will I have enough time alone?\nThe minutes begin to tick, the second-hand tapping in your ear, and a message flashes across your mind at least once a day: you are wasting time!\nThe urgency to take action builds. But instead of a corvette or paragliding, I imagine a career change, a tiny house, and possibly a meditation retreat.\nI imagine doing more of what I want, and less of what everyone else wants.\nI think about my grandmother, who was widowed early and had 25 years to herself. People used to ask her if she wanted to get remarried. She would smile like a Cheshire cat and reply, “Why would I do that? I am only responsible for myself now.” She had the resources to travel and eat out with friends and take in a Broadway show—that was her reward for a dutiful life. She wouldn’t have had it any other way, but what if she hadn’t outlived my grandfather?\nA woman’s midlife crisis isn’t about wanting to be younger. It is about wanting more time with herself, to live from a selfish place, one that isn’t populated with the needs of others.\nIt is about getting to know herself deeply, authentically, outside of the confines of her many roles. It is about reconnecting with a part of herself—the part that is Untamed, to quote Glennon Doyle, and free—that she may not have touched since adolescence.\nA midlife crisis is rooted in what we’ve had to give up, to put away for another time. For men, maybe it is their sexual prowess—that vital energy that makes them feel young and invincible. For women, it is their authentic, unadulterated sense of self, untethered from others’ expectations. Perhaps, if somehow, we could allow those parts to filter through along the way, we wouldn’t need to blow everything up to find them again later.\nOr perhaps, that is the beauty of a midlife crisis: to start again, reclaiming what was once ours.", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

{"id": "261", "text": "Technological advancements in MDEF is a key factor driving market revenue growth\nMarket Size – USD 10.20 Billion in 2022, Market Growth – at a CAGR of 8.0%, Market Trends – Rising awareness among end users about environmental benefits of Diesel Exhaust Fluid (DEF) in reducing harmful emissions\nVancouver, B.C., June 23, 2023 - The global Marine Diesel Exhaust Fluid (MDEF) market size is expected to reach USD 22.12 Billion in 2032 and register a steady revenue CAGR of 8.0% during the forecast period, according to latest analysis by Emergen Research. Rising awareness among end users about environmental benefits of DEF in reducing harmful emissions is a key factor driving market revenue growth. DEFs stands out as an eco-conscious alternative due to the transformative impact of the product on harmful emissions, converting the fluids into nitrogen and water. In contrast, diesel fuel releases hazardous Nitrogen Oxide (NOx) emissions, which contribute to acid rain and the greenhouse effect. DEF, primarily composed of 67.5% de-ionized water and 32.5% urea (also known as carbamide), serves as an environment-friendly substance. Urea enhances non-toxic properties and maintains a potential of Hydrogen (pH)-neutral nature. Notably, urea enables impressive ability to bind with specific substances, particularly nitrogen.\nHowever, scarcity of DEF and global increase in urea prices are key factors, which could restrain market revenue growth. DEF, a combination of urea and water, is injected into exhaust stream of vehicles, which plays a vital role in reducing nitrous oxide emissions from diesel engines. According to the World Bank, by October 2022, there will be a 70% reduction in ammonia output in Europe, which has led to shortages of diesel exhaust fluid in key countries. Moreover, supply concerns, export issues, trade restrictions, and production shortages in Europe along with disruptions caused by sanctions against Russia and Belarus, as well as trade limitations in China, are other factors, which could restrain market revenue growth.\nSome Key Highlights From the Report\nOn 24 April 2023, Sun Coast Resources, one of the country's preeminent leaders in fuel, lubricants, DEF distribution, and emergency response solutions, partnered with RelaDyne, the country's largest lubricant distributor and market leader in fuel, Diesel Exhaust Fluid (DEF), and industrial reliability services. The merger of Sun Coast with RelaDyne significantly increases RelaDyne's market share and geographic coverage in Texas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, New Mexico, and the Carolinas.\nThe large commercial vehicles segment is expected to account for largest revenue share in the global MDEF market over the forecast period. This is due to stringent emission regulations implemented by governments and regulatory bodies on a global scale. These regulations mandate the use of DEF and Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) systems to effectively reduce Nitrogen Oxide (NOx) emissions from diesel engines. SCR systems utilize DEF to initiate a chemical reaction that converts harmful NOx emissions into nitrogen and water vapor, which are less harmful. Furthermore, increasing adoption of SCR technology in large commercial vehicles and rising implementation of SCR technology are also expected to drive revenue growth of this segment during the forecast period.\nThe Selective Catalytic reduction (SCR) catalysts segment is expected to register steadily fast revenue growth rate in the global MDEF market over the forecast period. This is because SCR technology possesses the capacity to effectively reduce levels of harmful nitrogen oxide in exhaust gases from diesel engines, surpassing requirements set by IMO Tier III emission regulations (3.4 g/kWh and lower). Over the past three decades, SCR has proven to be a reliable and readily available technology in the market. This technology has been successfully implemented across a diverse range of engine and vessel types, operating under various engine settings and utilizing fuels with different sulfur contents. The industry's supply chains supporting SCR are highly competitive and well-established.\nThe Asia Pacific market is expected to account for largest revenue share in the global MDEF market during the forecast period. This is attributed to increasing activities by key market players in countries in this region. For example, Indian Oil has formed a partnership with Cummins Technologies India Pvt. Limited to facilitate the bulk distribution of Indian Oil’s Diesel Exhaust Fluid (DEF), commercially known as IOC ClearBlue, in modern engines equipped with Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) systems. Practice of bulk DEF dispensing aligns with global patterns and offers enhanced economic feasibility to truck and bus operators compared to packaged supplies. This collaboration enables provision of a top-notch product to clients countrywide by leveraging Cummins technological expertise alongside Indian Oil's proficiency in bulk dispensing.\nSome major companies in the global market report include Yara International ASA, BASF SE, Shell plc., Totalenergies SE, Mitsui Chemicals, Inc., Valvoline Cummins Private Limited, CF Industries Holdings, Inc., ZF Friedrichshafen AG, Gulf Oil Lubricants India Ltd., and Cummins Inc.", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}

{"id": "265", "text": "Being bullied is not an easy thing to cope with. Bullying can leave kids feeling helpless, vulnerable, and confused. Consequently, when kids are bullied, they are often so shocked by bullying that they are not sure what to do. But this indecision and lack of response can open the door to more bullying. Make sure your kids are prepared should the situation ever occur.\nHow Your Child Can Deal With a Bully\nTo keep bullies from harassing your kids, make sure they know what to do if confronted by a bully. Aside from developing their assertiveness skills, building their self-esteem and improving their social skills, they also need practical tools on how to handle bullying situations. Here are seven ideas that any child can implement.\nIgnore the bully. Not reacting when someone says or does something hurtful is often the most effective response to bullying. Most bullies are looking for a reaction. They want the target to get angry or cry. And, if your child has an emotional response to bullying, it often continues and may even escalate. Conversely, if your child keeps on walking with his head held high every time someone engages in name-calling or any other type of bullying, the bully will eventually move on when he realizes he will not get a response from your child.\nTell the bully to stop. Again, bullies often do not expect someone to stand up to them. In fact, they often target kids they believe they can intimidate. As a result, telling a bully to stop in a strong and confident voice can be very effective. In fact, bullies often count on finding a victim who will not say anything at all. But if your child makes sure the bully knows he cannot walk all over him, the bully is more likely to stop what he is doing.\nMake a joke or agree with the bully. Some kids are naturally funny and find it easy to laugh right along with the bully. When kids are able to do this, it demonstrates that they are confident about who they are; and it does not bother them if other people point out their flaws. In fact, they are often secure enough to laugh right along with the bully. When your child laughs with the bully, it diffuses any power the bully thought he had over your child, and his bullying methods become ineffective.\nAvoid bullying hot spots. Sometimes all it takes to prevent bullying is to avoid places where bullies hang out. These bullying hot spots include areas like the far corners of the playground, vacant hallways, bathrooms, locker rooms, and the back of the bus. Be sure your child knows where these spots are located and that he avoids them or travels with a buddy when he can. Sometimes the best way to deter bullying is to avoid crossing paths with the bully.\nStick with friends. Bullies usually look for kids who are alone or socially isolated. Be sure your child knows that hanging out with friends is a great way to prevent bullying. If your child struggles with social skills or has very few friends, take steps to help him develop friendships. Having just one healthy friendship can go a long way in protecting your child from bullies.\nKnow how to get out of a bullying situation. Talk to your child about ways in which he can defend himself against bullies, especially if the bullying is physical. For instance, be sure your child knows to keep his eye on the exit and to use it when the opportunity presents itself. Other options include making a lot of noise, attracting attention, and knowing how to deflect any type of physical aggression. Your child does not have to “fight” the bully to defend himself. He just needs to know how to diffuse the situation and get to safety.\nReport the bullying to an adult. Be sure your child knows that the best way to prevent bullying is to report it. Without adult intervention, bullying often will continue or escalate. Talk about the reasons why kids don’t tell others they are being bullied and be sure your children know that you understand their fears. Stress that while it takes a lot of strength and courage to report bullying, it is the smartest way to handle this type of situation. Also be careful not to engage in victim-blaming or to criticize your child for getting bullied. Bullying is a choice made by the bully and never the responsibility of the victim.", "scores": {"score": 4, "score_transform_1": 5, "score_transform_2": 5, "score_transform_3": 0}}

And many wonder, ironically or maybe not, after survived to a pandemic will I die for an asteroid? Between pandemics and distructions for a meteor impact, which will be the apocalypse that will affect the Earth in this fatal year? We are talking about OR2, an asteroid potentially dangerous that will pass by the earth in a few days. But don’t worry, it’s only another problem that will face the humanity this year and the NASA reassures us: the asteroid will pass by the Earth, but it won’t touch it.\nWho is OR2, the asteroid that will pass by the Earth in a few days?\nThere are about 758.000 catalogued asteroids that pass next to the Earth, 1900 of them are considered potentially dangerous for it. OR2 is one of them.\nOR2 was discovered in the 1998 and it was promptly put between the ones potentially dangerous. This because it had some characteristics. It has a diameter of about one kilometers and a half and to be considered dangerous it must be bigger than 140-150 meters. So it’s over this characteristic.\nAnother characteristic that it must have to be considered potentially dangerous it’s about its orbit. It is between the ones that get closer than 7.5 million of kilometers to the Earth.\nOR2, in its minor distance, will pass by the Earth of 6 million of kilometers. But we don’t have to be worry neither, because, as the NASA reassures, 6 million of kilometers means about 16 times the distance Earth-Moon. In the past many asteroid get much closer than how much OR2 will do, but these were even much smaller.\nThe observation of OR2\nSure, all these reassurances make not all relaxed. And the biggest part of who waits for the passage of the asteroid will remain with the bated breath at least until the 30th of april, when the crisis will be averted.\nThis close passage is, instead, reason of study for many astronomers. OR2 will be observable with telescope even really small and even with simple binoculars, as well as many instruments, like radars, optical and thermic appliances.\nThe usage of all these instruments, for the whole time during which the asteroid will pass very close to the planet Earth, will allow to understand many secrets of it. Like more detailed measurements, physical property, rotation, percentage of light that it reflects from the sun, etc.\nCurrently the size, even if we know that they are considerable, are still included in a too large range: between 1,8 and 4,1 kilometers. The Observatory of Arecibo, in Puerto Rico, discovered already that it has a diameter of at least one kilometer and half, but these close observations will allow to do more precise calculations.\nHere you have how to see the asteroid\nNo destruction, so. Only a lot of tension and a lot of emotion for the close passage of a such big asteroid. But can we see it?\nIn the period of maximum approach of the asteroid it will visible even from Italy. It will be the night between the 28th and the 29th of april, while the best time will be between the 21.30 and the 22.00, even if it will be visible for almost all the night.\nThe position that it will occupy in the sky will be at 25 degree at south-west, between the stars of the Hydra and the constellation of the Lion. To see it it will be enough a small telescope or a great binocular.\nAn occasion that we can’t miss, because the next time that OR2 will come back to visit us it will be in the 2079. Even if in that case the “don’t worry” will be fewer, because it will pass only 1,8 million of kilometers away. But we still have 59 years to think about it.\nThis post is also available in: Italiano", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}

To speed up the process and help me\nMassage treatment room\nMassage treatment room\nMassage treatment room\ntarget this first consultation to you, I send new clients an electronic New Client Form when the first appointment is booked. The form takes 5-10 minutes to complete and needs to be completed and returned before the appointment. Once we have been through the consultation and assessment I discuss my treatment approach with you, answer any questions you may have and obtain your agreement to begin treatment. My philosophy of client-centred treatment means that I encourage clients to be active participants in their treatment. This can involve working with you to come up with some self management strategies. Depending on your treatment goals, these may be aimed at helping you to increase or add variation to daily movement, increase body awareness, use mindfulness/relaxation techniques to help manage stress or tension, help you to understand how pain can affect movement and behaviour and work with you to address any fear or worry about your pain, and help you find solutions that support you to feel, move and live well.\nThe massage room is a professional, warm space with comfortable electric massage table, clean linen and in cooler months, a heating pad underneath to keep you warm.

These are the words he wants to make known,” lawyer Cedric Moisse told reporters in Brussels.\nAbdeslam’s arrest was considered a rare success in Belgium’s anti-terror fight, although he was found within a short distance of his family home in the Molenbeek district of the capital. He has refused to talk since the Brussels bombings.\nThe transfer to France should happen “within 10 days”, said French justice minister Jean-Jacques Urvoas.\nBelgian investigators will still be allowed to question Abdeslam in France.\nHe is believed to have acted as a logistics coordinator for the Paris attacks and has told investigators he was meant to carry out a suicide bombing at the Stade de France stadium but backed out.\n– Police concerns at airport –\nBrussels airport, closed since its departure hall was wrecked in the attacks, said it had received the go-ahead from fire services and the Belgian Civil Aviation Authority “for a partial restart of passenger flights”.\n“The airport is thus technically ready for a restart,” it said in a statement. “However, the authorities have yet to take a formal decision on the restart date. Until Friday evening, no passenger flights will take place at Brussels Airport.”\nIn a bid to end the travel chaos caused by the closure of a major European air hub, hundreds of staff staged drills this week to test temporary check-in facilities as well as enhanced security measures.\nUnder the temporary arrangements, Zaventem airport would be able to handle 800 departing passengers per hour — around 20 percent of normal capacity, it said.\nAdding to the airport’s woes, police unions threatened to go on strike if security measures are not improved ahead of the reopening.\nAlso Thursday, Portugal stepped up security at its airports following a message purportedly from the Islamic State group threatening attacks on Lisbon.\n“Necessary security measures have been taken, including at airports,” said Helena Fazenda, head of the country’s internal security force, after the non-authenticated message was circulated on social media.\n– Jihadist web –\nClose links have emerged between the Paris and Brussels attackers, exposing a tangled web of cross-border extremist cells and triggering a series of raids and arrests in several European countries.\nIn the latest operation on Thursday, police and soldiers searched a wooded area in western Belgium, with authorities saying the raid was linked to a thwarted plot to attack France.\nThe main suspect in that case, Reda Kriket, has been charged in France with membership of a terrorist organisation after police found an arsenal of weapons and explosives at his home.\nThe joint French-Belgian operation by masked police and soldiers along a busy motorway lasted for several hours but Belgian prosecutors said no weapons or explosives were found and no arrests were made.\nBelgian-born French citizen Abdeslam has connections to at least two of the Brussels bombers. Khalid El Bakraoui, who blew himself up at the metro, rented a flat in Brussels where Abdeslam’s fingerprints were found.\nOne of the two airport bombers, Najim Laachraoui, drove to Hungary with Abdeslam in September.\nBelgium is still searching for a suspected third attacker, the so-called “man in the hat” seen in surveillance images alongside the two airport bombers.\nWith no suspects in custody over the attacks, police appealed for possible images taken by members of the public.", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

During his tenure, he proposed strategies and oversaw investigations aimed at limiting foreign money laundering threats from accessing the U.S. financial system. Mr. Borrayo led investigations resulting in the successful execution of numerous actions imposed under Section 311 of the USA PATRIOT Act targeting foreign jurisdictions, including DPRK and Iran, and financial institutions, including ABLV Bank. He managed the administration of FinCEN’s special information collection authorities provided to FinCEN under the Bank Secrecy Act, including the Geographic Targeting Order and Foreign Financial Agency regulations. Mr. Borrayo ensured that these efforts contributed to ongoing investigations and advanced the U.S. government’s understanding of current and over the horizon illicit finance threats.\nAs a seasoned expert in FinCEN’s authorities, Mr. Borrayo was routinely called upon to brief Congressional Committee staff, such as Banking and Foreign Relations, with respect to FinCEN administered authorities used to target foreign illicit finance threats.\nPrior to his tenure at FinCEN, Mr. Borrayo spent over a decade at the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) in the Enforcement Division. Starting in 2003, he investigated potential violations of OFAC sanctions programs, and provided guidance to law enforcement on the admissibility of international trade transactions – which contributed to the execution of both OFAC civil enforcement actions and criminal matters.\nIn 2005, Mr. Borrayo transitioned to OFAC’s Targeting Division where he conducted all source investigations and proposed designation actions related to high priority national security threats. His portfolio included investigations into elaborate nuclear and ballistic missile procurement networks utilized by Iran and DPRK and authoring evidentiary memoranda in support of designation actions issued by OFAC. Mr. Borrayo worked closely with other U.S. government agencies and U.S.-allied governments in support of the multilateralization of certain targeted U.S. sanctions programs. His collaboration contributed to the successful adoption of the United Nations Security Council Resolutions designed to address Iran and the DPRK’s weapons programs. Mr. Borrayo played a pivotal role in informing senior policy makers with regards to key financial vulnerabilities related to foreign adversaries and “over the horizon” threats. His ability to identify these vulnerabilities contributed substantially to Treasury’s successful outreach efforts to isolate Iran’s illicit finance networks. In addition, he made significant contributions in scoping Executive Orders and Congressional laws by enhancing their Targeting utility and ensuring they can be utilized effectively.\nAs Senior Director of Investigations at Ferrari and Associates, Mr. Borrayo leads efforts in conducting due diligence investigations on a variety of matters. This includes supporting the Firm’s advisory services and assisting international clients with respect to sanctions compliance issues and pre-transactional due diligence and investigations into third party vendors, intermediaries and supply chain actors. Mr. Borrayo’s wealth of Treasury experience also provides the Firm unique insights and significant added value in connection to its work with clients who are seeking to be removed from the OFAC SDN list.\n- Augmented sanctions and anti-money laundering policies and procedures for a U.S. based crowdfunding platform with significant global touchpoints. Developed enhanced due diligence forms and sanctions screening and escalation procedures.\n- Developed supplemental sanctions and anti-money laundering procedures for a mid-size European financial institution. Designed a guide containing risk factors to consider when assessing whether transactional information implicates a U.S. sanctions or money laundering concern.\n- Conducted sanctions risk assessment for a major African based commodities entity. Reviewed its operations and transactions, identified vulnerabilities, and recommended measures to rebut adverse news media and minimize sanctions exposure.\n- Serve as a subject matter expert on Firm’s ongoing OFAC sanctions delisting matters.

That he doesn’t quite dress it up in the manner that perhaps other documentary makers – think Michael Moore without the gimmicks – might do shouldn’t detract from the powerful message behind the portrayal.\nManaging to interview some fairly high profile talking heads (recent PM Kevin Rudd among them), Pilger clearly has the clout and the access to lend the documentary some weight. He may lack the charm at times to tease the truth from those in his sights, instead choosing to rile them up, but his passion and dedication to his cause is never in question, despite the consequent entertainment factor his somewhat aggressive questioning delivers.\nAmidst the various tales of poverty and appalling injustice meted out on the people via stories, recollections and some genuinely shocking CCTV, some of the most disturbing moments bring us bang up to date. Prepare to be astounded as Pilger interviews Australia Day revellers descended from those he feels have ‘invaded’ the country, revealing a shocking ignorance of the scale of the country’s injustices and a casual lack of interest in caring anyway.\nSo while it’s unlikely Pilger, and indeed Utopia, will be taken up by the Aussie tourist board to accurately portray the country, his scathing indictment of its dark heart deserves recognition for actually doing just that.\nUTOPIA + John Pilger Q&A – Picturehouse Cinemas UK", "scores": {"score": 3, "score_transform_1": 5, "score_transform_2": 5, "score_transform_3": 0}}
{"id": "306", "text": "Screenplay writing is an art, and like any art, it requires skill, patience, and a good dose of creativity. Whether you are a novice or an experienced screenwriter, there are certain dos and don'ts that you should keep in mind to make your screenplay stand out.\nThe concept is the backbone of your screenplay, so it's important to spend time developing it. Make sure your concept is unique, clear, and compelling enough to grab the attention of your readers. A good concept should be able to convey the theme, tone, and genre of your story in just a few words.\nOne of the biggest mistakes that screenwriters make is rushing the plotting stage. Plotting is the process of laying out the sequence of events in your story, and it's crucial to get it right.\nTake your time to brainstorm, research, and develop your plot to ensure that it's well-structured, cohesive, and engaging.\nCharacters are the heart of your story, so it's important to create those that are well-rounded, relatable, and memorable. Make sure your characters have clear goals, motivations, and flaws that drive the story forward. Avoid creating one-dimensional characters that are merely plot devices.\nExposition is the information that you provide to the audience to help them understand the story. While exposition is necessary, overusing it can lead to a dull and unengaging story.\nTry to incorporate exposition naturally into the dialogue and actions of your characters instead of relying on long-winded explanations.\nScreenplays are a visual medium, so it's important to write visually. Use descriptive language and vivid imagery to help the reader visualize the world you've created. Avoid relying on lengthy descriptions or relying on the camera direction, which can limit the imagination of the reader and the creativity of the director.\nCliches are overused phrases or ideas that have lost their originality and impact. Avoid using cliches in your screenplay as they can make your story predictable and unoriginal. Instead, strive for originality and creativity to make your story stand out.\nEditing and rewriting are essential to creating a polished and well-written screenplay. After you've finished your first draft, take a break and come back to it later with fresh eyes. Look for areas that need improvement and refine your writing until it's as clear and concise as possible.\nFinally, don't be afraid to take risks with your screenplay. The most memorable and impactful stories often take risks and break conventions.\nWhile it's important to understand the rules of screenwriting, don't be afraid to bend or break them to create a story that is unique and memorable.", "scores": {"score": 3, "score_transform_1": 5, "score_transform_2": 5, "score_transform_3": 0}}

Whatever be the case, parents take every effort to get the problem solved as soon as possible. There are many natural solutions that can relief the child from bedwetting. The bedwetting habit of children will not vanish away within a few days of manifesting the home remedies, but will require a more consistent and longer approach.\nHence, parents need to be more patient and follow the remedies continually, for two months to expect the change. In addition, children should be always taught about the bathroom habits and ensure they never go to bed, without visiting the toilet, just before the sleep.\nHome Remedies For Bedwetting\nChildren can be made to chew one cinnamon bark in a day to overcome the bedwetting trouble at night. It is known to be the simplest remedy that keeps the body warm, thereby preventing urination while asleep. Alternatively, every morning cinnamon powder along with little sugar can be sprinkled over a regular buttered toast and given as breakfast to the child.\nJaggery has a heating effect on the body, keeping body warm from within thus helps to overcome the bedwetting problem. Give a small piece of jaggery every morning with a cup of warm milk and then, post an hour offer roasted sesame seeds and sesame seeds with a little rock salt to the child. Consuming it in above manner for two months will cure the problem.\nAvoid Caffeine Foods\nCaffeine stimulates urination and therefore foods and beverages containing caffeine like chocolate or cola drinks should be avoided in the evening.

Giving one teaspoon of amla pulp with a pinch of powdered black pepper to the child, before going to bed helps to cure bedwetting issue. Alternatively, prepare a mixture of cumin seeds, sugar candy and amla powder for the child and offer it twice a day to achieve positive results.\nCranberry juice is beneficial for the bladder, kidneys and the urinary tract. It helps in strengthening of urinary tract linings that can withhold urine for long hours.\nOn contrary to all other fluids that should never be offered to child before going to bed, fresh cranberry juice is recommended to be given an hour before the sleep time, to reduce and prevent bedwetting. Regularly offering of cranberry juice for several months will stop bedwetting problem completely.\nRaisins and Walnuts\nOffer the tasty snacks of walnut and raisins to child as these together make a tasty remedy for reducing bedwetting symptoms that children will lovingly have. Give one tablespoon of raisins and two tablespoon of walnuts to the child before bed time, to treat the bedwetting condition. Continue this remedial option for at least a few months, till the problem completely subsides.\nDouble Voiding Before Sleep\nEncourage the child to completely empty his/her bladder by going twice to the toilet, once at the bedtime routine and one more time, just before getting to sleep. Encourage to use toilet at night also, if required. Help the child with toilet at night till he/she can do it themselves.\nHalf a teaspoon of dry mustard seed powder with one cup of a little warm milk should be given to the child, one hour before the sleep.\nMustard seeds are very effective in curing all urinary problems. Alternatively, a handful of mustard seeds can be given to child for eating, during the day to get fast recovery from bedwetting troubles.\nHoney, a wonderful source of healthy and natural sugar is very useful in curing the bedwetting trouble. One teaspoon of honey before the bed time can stop the bedwetting problem completely in children. Honey can be offered mixed with milk, during morning breakfast or children can just directly eat it without much of a fuss.\nTeach your child bladder exercises that help him/her to control the bladder and strengthen bladder muscles. Offer the child large amounts of fluids throughout the entire day and make him/her practice withholding urine for certain duration. With time, the child will learn to control bladder action and this will be useful in controlling bladder muscles at night too. This is useful for children above age of five, who can perform this exercise more comfortably.\nBanana, the healthy and lovable fruit of children supports by binding stomach, thereby preventing bedwetting during night. Eating 2 to 3 bananas every day will reduce the problem to a large extent. Offer one banana at the breakfast and one at night, before bed time.\nInculcate Regular Toilet Use\nEncourage the child to use toilet, every two hours throughout the day, without letting the need of urgency to go to the toilet. Proper toilet habits will also sets an alarm at night, waking the child to urinate at night.\nLimit drinks In The Evening\nEnsure that child drinks more during the day and less at evenings and minimal at night time. Around 40% of fluids should be consumed between 7 a.m. to noon time, other 40% between noon till 5 p.m. and then just 20 % post 5 p.m. However, for children involved in sports or high physical activity or games in the evening, should never be restricted from drinking liquids even after 5 p.m.\nMoreover, in case children prefer drinking more during evening time, do not restrict as fluids are very essential for health and overcoming dehydration, a common problem found in children.\nSolve Constipation Troubles\nIn children, sometimes constipation can be the cause of bedwetting at night. Ensure the child is passing stools normally. In case, he/she is suffering from constipation, consult doctor for stool softener medications for the child.\nCaution: Please use Home Remedies after Proper Research and Guidance.

{"id": "316", "text": "Flying past rumbling train tracks, over gliding freeways and underneath an overcast New York City sky, Marvin Gaye’s ‘What’s Going On’ sets the tone for A Most Violent Year‘s opening moments perfectly. Gaye was a man who worked hard all his life, only to be beaten by the overbearing odds of the times he found himself in – much like Abel Morales, played by Oscar Isaac, the film’s tortured protagonist and a man of fierce principles. It’s a tenuous comparison, but one that makes more sense as J.C. Chandor’s grim tale of a defiant businessman making his reluctant segue into the world of gangsterism (yes, that is a real word) slowly takes its toll on Abel.\nIt’s 1981, the most crime-filled year in New York on record, and Morales stands as a man who has essentially raised himself. Having built his prospering oil company from the ground up, he takes immense pride in his work, and practically lives for the promise of forging a legacy for his family and wife Anna, played by a fiery Jessica Chastain. But this is all challenged by a mysterious plot to steal his oil trucks from the road, which also invites suspicion from the authorities. It’s as if Michael Corleone remained on the straight and narrow; although those comparisons may be a little easy to make, they are openly invited by Chandor’s constant yet calm debunking of the gangster mythos. Morales has an empire, yet gets scared when he sees a gun; his wife tells him to hide business folders when the police search his home, but he doesn’t know why. That’s what makes him such an arresting character to watch – he is constantly at odds with becoming something he doesn’t want to be, but it’s a transformation which feels inevitable. And Oscar Isaac, on a winning streak with Inside Llewyn Davis and Ex Machina – not to mention a little movie called Star Wars later this year – shows he is one of the world’s most gifted fresh actors, able to convey the intense, heavy moods of Chandor’s reluctant crime epic with a single glance of his eyes: oozing the gravitas of a much more experienced actor at every moment.\nA somewhat unexpected follow-up to the Robert Redford powerhouse All Is Lost, J.C. Chandor has crafted an engaging thriller that rarely uses any of the tropes of the genre, being more of a slow-boiling character study than a fizzling mystery story – but perhaps the greatest achievement of the film is its beautiful construction of early-’80s New York, a hazy network of breeze block buildings and grey-green skies. This triumphant achievement of tone lends the film’s more unconvincing moments an air of believability – for instance, when Chastain’s Anna changes tact at the drop of a hat. But what has been achieved here, thanks to some fantastic world-building and a perfect anchor in the form of Isaac, is the ultimate anti-gangster movie, which at one point literally quotes Goodfellas in reverse with a throwaway line that we won’t spoil here. Despite the occasional trip-up, A Most Violent Year is exquisite filmmaking from a director who feels like he’s just getting started.", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

Those sisters were Sr. Cecilia Daroit, Sr. Clotilde Appiano and Sr. Margareth Greppi. The house at Mawlai was officially opened on March 14th, 1938 by Mother Clotide M. Coglialo on her annual visit to Assam. The Convent was placed under the patronage of the Sacred Heart of Jesus. Sr. Cecelia Daroit was appointed the first Superior of the newly formed Community.

In 1956, Class VII was opened which proceeded to the establishment of a complete High School. In 1982, two adjacent plots of land were acquired to accommodate the increasing number of students. The year 1986 saw the establishment of a new building. In 1999, the High School was upgraded to Higher Secondary by the inclusion of Classes XI and XII.

{"id": "324", "text": "Matt Richards, a built environment expert and partner at Ridge and Partners, draws on new research to discuss the obstacles facilities managers face when trying to make their organisation’s building Net Zero\nA crucial piece of the puzzle in the Government’s ambitious goal of Net Zero by 2050 lies in retrofitting the UK’s non-domestic building stock. However, our research report, ‘The Role of Retrofitting our Non-Domestic Buildings in the Race to Net Zero’, reveals that many organisations are falling short in making their premises environmentally sustainable.\nThe fault for this doesn’t lie with facilities managers and property heads, who despite having a huge workload and many competing pressures to deal with, want to do more to play their part in their organisation’s move to Net Zero. Instead, the problem is the obstacles in their path.\nTHE OBSTACLES FACILITIES MANAGERS FACE\nThe 101 facilities and property heads we questioned in our study are facing several challenges to get retrofit projects for their organisations off the ground. These include:\n- Lack of Board Acknowledgment: A significant roadblock we identified is the lack of recognition from boards regarding the importance of retrofitting in their Net Zero strategy. Despite the majority (76 per cent) of organisations working towards Net Zero, over half (55 per cent) of the facilities and property managers we interviewed for the report said that their boards do not acknowledge the need for retrofitting at all.\n- Building Heads’ Involvement: This perhaps explains why many organisations are not involving building heads in Net Zero planning. Nearly 23 per cent of those we spoke to have had no involvement at all, and most have not seen their company’s five-year sustainability plans.\n- Underestimation of Carbon Pollution: We found that organisations are often underestimating the carbon pollution produced by their buildings which is leading to a lack of urgency to reduce it. There’s also confusion; the vast majority (86 per cent) of organisations do not understand how retrofitting can enhance a building’s energy efficiency.\n- Misconceptions about Building Stock: Many decision-makers harbour misconceptions about the life span of the UK’s existing non-domestic building stock, assuming that the majority will be replaced by 2050. In reality, approximately 70 per cent of today’s buildings will still be in use. This misunderstanding dampens the enthusiasm for retrofitting because it isn’t deemed necessary.\nOVERCOMING THE OBSTACLES\nTo help facilities managers address these obstacles we’ve identified five things which we believe need to happen:\n- Education: Retrofitting needs to be put on agendas and seen as a viable and often preferable alternative to building new. For instance, 24 per cent underestimate the impact of retrofitting, and 45 per cent mistakenly believe carbon-neutral grid energy will negate the need for energy efficiency measures. Also, many organisations ignore the carbon which has been used to create a new building – this must be factored in when weighing up the options.\n- Involvement: Boards must recognise and harness the expertise of facilities and property heads. Facilities leaders are already involved in other strategic decisions such as the role of buildings on their employer brand or in improving staff wellbeing, performance, and retention. The sustainability agenda is surely another area where property heads can play a major part. Their expertise needs to be respected and deployed.\n- Budgeting: Retrofit programmes require substantial investment. They cannot be accommodated within day-to-day budgets. Yet over half (54 per cent) of boards base their building budgets on the previous year, which doesn’t consider inflation or energy price fluctuations, let alone a large retrofit project. A new, more strategic approach to building budgets is needed.\n- Expert Support: Even with their expertise, facilities heads need external support to navigate the complexities of achieving Net Zero and evaluating the benefits of retrofitting vs a new build. Expert guidance is crucial for making informed decisions, prioritising projects, choosing technologies, and building strong business cases.\n- Incentives: The Government needs to help too. Incentives for energy-efficient buildings are currently lacking. Addressing issues such as VAT treatment for retrofit programs can level the playing field with new builds and encourage more retrofit initiatives.\nPRACTICALITIES OF RETROFITTING\nOvercoming these obstacles is crucial, but we recognise that implementing retrofit strategies can also pose challenges. For instance, almost a third (31 per cent) of facilities heads surveyed feel delivering retrofit projects without causing disruption is a tough challenge.\nHowever, the long-term benefits of retrofit projects, including achieving Net Zero goals, enhancing building efficiency, ensuring employee health and wellbeing, improving productivity, and attracting and retaining staff, outweigh short-term disruptions. Proper planning with multidisciplinary consultant teams can minimise disruption, allowing organisations to continue operations during retrofit projects.\nWhile many organisations are making strides in reducing their carbon footprint, the role of buildings in this endeavour remains underestimated. To make substantial progress, a collaborative approach is needed to address the five key areas hindering retrofitting efforts. Once these are tackled, with the right practical support and expertise, facilities management professionals can truly play a pivotal role in delivering the UK’s Net Zero ambitions.\nThe full report can be accessed at: https://ridge.co.uk/insights/the-uks-retrofit-crisis/", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}

This sauce is more of a fusion-style Asian dressing combining fish sauce in addition to soy sauce, lime juice, brown sugar and hot pepper sauce.\nThe dressing component calls for Garlic-Infused Oil for a garlicky kick. Make sure yours is based on vegetable oil and not olive oil.\nRotisserie Chicken, Poached Chicken, Roast Chicken – We Love Chicken!\nThis recipe calls for shredded cooked chicken. You can use white meat or dark meat, or a combo. You can use some from our Whole Roasted Chicken, or simply poach boneless, skinless chicken breasts or thighs in water seasoned with salt, a few peppercorns and a bay leaf.\nIf you have time, throw in a few pieces of chopped carrot and celery for flavor, if you have them around.\nCostco as well as Whole Foods have plain rotisserie chicken available that is low FODMAP. Perhaps your local supermarket does too? Ask!\nLow FODMAP Asian Chicken Salad\nThink chicken salad is boring? Try this flavor-packed Low FODMAP Asian Chicken Salad\nPeanut Butter Dressing:\n- 6 tablespoons (102 g) peanut butter, either natural or no-stir style\n- 3 tablespoons firmly packed light brown sugar\n- 3 tablespoons rice vinegar or apple cider vinegar\n- 3 tablespoons low-sodium gluten-free soy sauce\n- 11/2 tablespoons fish sauce, such as Red Boat brand\n- 1 1/2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lime juice\n- 1 1/2 tablespoons Garlic-Infused Oil, made with vegetable oil or purchased equivalent\n- ¼ to ½ teaspoon sambal oelek or low FODMAP hot sauce such as Tabasco, or more to taste\n- Water, if needed\n- 1- pound (455 g) shredded cooked chicken warm or at room temperature\n- 4 cups (356 g) finely shredded green cabbage\n- 2 medium carrots, trimmed and grated\n- 1 red bell pepper, cored and finely sliced\n- 2 Persian cucumbers, ends trimmed, cut into large julienne\n- 1/2 cup (16 g) chopped fresh cilantro, divided\n- 1/2 cup (80 g) chopped roasted peanuts, divided\n- 1/2 cup (32 g) chopped scallions, green parts only, divided\nFor the Peanut Butter Dressing: Combine peanut butter, brown sugar, vinegar, soy sauce, fish sauce, lime juice, oil and hot sauce in a blender and blend until smooth and combined. Scrape down blender as needed. Taste and add more hot sauce if desired. If you use natural peanut butter and the mixture is a bit thick, blend in a tablespoon or two of water. You want a flowable texture. The dressing can be made a day ahead and refrigerated in an airtight container.\nFor Chicken Salad Assembly: In a large mixing bowl, toss together the chicken, cabbage, carrot, bell pepper, cucumbers of the cilantro, half the peanuts and half of the scallions (you can do this by eye). Add some of the dressing and toss to coat. Only add enough dressing to lightly coat the salad ingredients. You might not need all of the sauce. Serve garnished with remaining cilantro, peanuts and scallions. Salad may be serve with the chicken slightly warm, or everything at room temperature.\nSalad may be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 3 days. Bring to room temperature before serving. It is best if you can garnish with the scallions, peanuts and cilantro right before serving. Or even better, if you know you want to make way ahead, keep salad and dressing separate until close to serving time (and those garnishes, too!)\n- Like so many dishes that need cooked chicken, you could make things super simple and buy a rotisserie chicken. Many are low FODMAP (even the ones at Costco). Just always buy the “plain” style and read labels. You might even be able to find a low FODMAP rotisserie chicken at your local supermarket.\nAll nutritional information is based on third-party calculations and should be considered estimates.

{"id": "326", "text": "Planning for retirement is not something most young people think about, especially when they in the early part of their careers.\nHowever, statistics show that starting to set a bit of cash aside on a regular basis from the moment you begin working can have a significant impact on the amount of funds available when the time comes to retire.\nThe main reason is the ability to harness the power of compounding, especially when the money is invested in dividend-paying stocks. Over time, the reinvestment of the distributions in new shares can turn relatively small contributions into significant sums of money, but you have to start early.\nMost investors view Suncor as an oil sands company. That’s certainly the largest part of its business, but Suncor also has positions in offshore oil production and growth opportunities worldwide. In Eastern Canada, the recently completed Hebron facility is ramping up production ahead of schedule. Suncor also has positions in other major Atlantic plays, including Hibernia, White Rose, and Terra Nova. In Europe, Suncor is a partner in key exploration and production opportunities in the U.K. and Norway.\nAside from the upstream assets, Suncor has refining and marketing operations. The four large refineries produce end products including gasoline, diesel fuel, asphalt and jet fuel. The company’s 1,500 Petro-Canada retail locations sell fuel.\nIn addition, Suncor has four wind power projects with capacity of more than 100 MW. The company also operates Canada’s largest biofuels plant.\nA recovery in the energy sector is providing a nice boost to margins, and Suncor continues to share the profits with investors. The company raised the dividend by 12.5% for 2018, and the steady gains should continue in the coming years. At the time of writing, the stock provides a yield of 2.7%.\nLong-term investors have done well with Suncor. A $10,000 investment in the company 20 years ago would be worth more than $120,000 today with the dividends reinvested.\nRenewable power and electric cars certainly pose a threat to the oil industry, and while the combustion engine should eventually be phased out, predictions about the impending death of the oil sector are likely overblown.\nShould you buy Suncor stock?\nThe company has a strong balance sheet and a resource base that should drive production growth for decades. Suncor’s diversified business lines provide a nice hedge against downturns in the oil market and the company manages to capture global pricing on a significant part of its production, despite pipeline bottlenecks in western Canada.\nAt some point, the pipeline issue should get resolved, and that would enable Suncor to boost output and sell to additional overseas markets.\nIf you are a long-term oil bull, Suncor is an attractive buy-and-hold pick for a dividend-focused retirement portfolio.", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}

We have several packages built to fit your budget and get you exactly what you need to start sniping on the airsoft battlefield. Our Sniper Starter Kits come in two levels, a BASIC or COMPLETE kit. The basic kit gets you the barebones setup to shoot your sniper rifle and have a magnified optic on it. The complete kit adds the required protective gear such as a face mask and googles to get you out there on the airsoft field.\nQ: What is included in the Ares Amoeba Striker Starter Kit from Fox Airsoft?\nA: The Ares Amoeba Striker Starter Kit includes the Ares Amoeba Striker AS-01 airsoft gun, a magazine, heavyweight 2700 BBs, a Lancer Tactical 3-9x40 Rifle Scope, Lancer Tactical Aero Goggles, a black mesh mask, an Echo 1 47\" Padded Gun Case, and an optic shield.\nQ: What additional items are required to start playing with this starter kit?\nA: No additional items are required to start playing with the Ares Amoeba Striker Starter Kit. It comes with everything you need to play at an airsoft field.\nQ: What are some key features of the Ares Amoeba Striker AS-01 included in this kit?\nA: The Ares Amoeba Striker AS-01 features a high-quality nylon fiber stock, a modular stock design with interchangeable parts (grip, cheek riser), a metal receiver and barrel, a 23mm clockwise threaded outer barrel, a short stroke bolt pull, and it uses AEG springs for easy upgrade/downgrade. It also utilizes TM VSR-10 cocking handle, hop-up bucking, and 550mm TM inner barrels for upgrades.\nQ: What is the muzzle velocity of the Ares Amoeba Striker AS-01 airsoft gun in this kit?\nA: The Ares Amoeba Striker AS-01 in this kit has a muzzle velocity of 400 FPS with 0.20-gram BBs.\nQ: What are the color options available for the Ares Amoeba Striker Starter Kit?\nA: The Ares Amoeba Striker Starter Kit is available in the color black, desert tan, olive drab, and urban grey\nAbout the Ares Amoeba Striker AS-01:\nAfter much talk and anticipation, Elite Force has brought us a game changing sniper rifle that anybody can afford. The Ares Amoeba Striker AS-01 is the new benchmark in affordable high quality sniper rifles. Though this rifle is affordable, don't let the sub-$200 price fool you. Though deceptively inexpensive, when you first pick up this rifle you will immediately notice that it feels like a premium grade real steel rifle. The polymer stock has a nice texture and rigid feel to it that you would expect out of a real rifle that has a synthetic stock. Internally and externally this rifle was designed with modularity in mind. The stock can be adapted in numerous ways with different grip sections, recoil pads, and cheek pieces to fit the user.\nThe main selling point is its practicality. The internals utilize commonly found upgrade parts that are used to typically upgrade a VSR-10 style sniper rifle. Normally most sniper rifles are proprietary or use items that are still harder to locate though they are available. This makes sniper rifles a type of gun in airsoft that becomes very specialized if you want to use it any other way than stock out of the box. This is sometimes a bad solution for the newer players who are buying a new rifle and trying to be conscious of future desires in accuracy and performance and choose to buy right by buying once. This gun still shoots nicely whether you are trying to future proof or not.\nSo what else makes it practical? The cylinder is specially designed to use AEG springs. This gives you numerous velocity options that typically are not available in sniper rifles. As a byproduct of this, cocking the Striker is much easier due to the shorter pull than traditional airsoft snipers. This makes it ideal for faster shooting on a bolt action rifle.\nNo sights are included so you will have to purchase a scope right off thee bat when you get this rifle. This rifle features a picatinny rail so you can scope the rifle with just about anything you can find. The magazine is 45 rounds and is a detachable magazine that can be quickly changed for fast reloads. Since the magazine is larger than normal, this makes it easier to grab compared to other sniper rifle magazines which are tiny and sit flush in the gun.\nThis airsoft sniper rifle is offered in 4 colors, black, desert tan, olive drab and urban grey.\nFOX AIRSOFT OFFERS A 30 DAY WARRANTY AND REFUND POLICY WHICH YOU CAN READ MORE ABOUT HERE.

{"id": "338", "text": "by Erin Pender | November 22, 2022\nOur Teacher Feature series highlights how special education teachers and professionals have each implemented FrenalyticsEDU into their classrooms. This edition features Jennifer Gemski, ATP (Assistive Technology Professional) at the Campus School at Boston College.\nJen Gemski began working at the Campus School at Boston College in the fall of 2020 as an Assistive Technology Professional (ATP), introducing a variety of technology into classrooms. The Campus School serves students with extensive support and medical needs between the ages of three and twenty-two, and has six classrooms with three to six students per class.\nJoining the Campus School in the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic, Jen experienced the challenges of providing remote therapies to students. Those challenges included tracking progress and maintaining communication among team members. Gemski said, “It’s always better to be in person.” Jen discovered FrenalyticsEDU and realized it could help address these challenges:\nAs far as Frenalytics, I see the benefit as allowing therapists to share information amongst the students’ entire team, including therapists, family members, and educators. Capturing progress data and comprehension questions for our students, especially those who are non-verbal, is especially powerful.”\nGemski sees Frenalytics as an effective way to capture data, especially with the students in which the Campus School serves. Jen is currently trialing classroom integration with FrenalyticsEDU, our personalized learning software designed with teachers, for teachers in special education environments.\nSince many of her students are nonverbal, it is important to be able to collect accurate data about student comprehension as well as information about their personal preferences. Additionally, since all of the students have Individualized Education Programs (IEPs), it is essential to look at what is working, and to easily track each student’s progress.\nGemski also emphasized that Frenalytics is unique because of how it can be customized:\nI also think Frenalytics is unique because because at the Campus School, we use a customized, multi-sensory approach. Most of the other cognitive applications or software applications in this space don’t have that flexibility.”\nThe Campus School uses other innovative technology programs, including Camera Mouse, a mouse replacement program for computers developed at Boston College. Gemski was elated to discover that Frenalytics is compatible with this technology.\nWith FrenalyticsEDU, the comprehension and assessment questions that are part of teachers’ lessons can be entered directly into the software, allowing students to review what they have learned. Additionally, the data collected by Frenalytics allows teachers and other special education professionals to track students’ progress:\nI’m excited to capture meaningful data throughout our student’s school day.”\nIf a student clicks the right answer, was it an involuntary movement, or intentional? Consistency and repetition is key; by using Frenalytics to repeat questions, Gemski and other staff members can review the data collected and identify patterns indicating a student’s progress:\nWe can make comparisons… Everybody keeps their own notes and their own data… with Frenalytics we share data and have the ability to share responses and to view everyone’s data at once.”\nAdditionally, Gemski explained that being able to display pictures and sounds into Frenalytics alongside answer options is so important for the students whom she serves:\nOur students benefit from a multi-sensory approach… sight, sound, touch, smell, feelings, presence.”\nThis multi-sensory approach can also help educators and other professionals to customize students’ therapy sessions or classroom sessions. For example, Gemski said that if a student shows a clear and repeated preference for Taylor Swift, different professionals throughout the day can offer her songs to that student as a leisure choice.\nGemski’s experiences with Frenalytics and her vision for how it can be useful across classrooms at the Campus School demonstrate the ways in which FrenalyticsEDU can be a useful tool for students, teachers, and other educational professionals across the country – and around the world.\nHere at Frenalytics, our goal is to provide meaningful educational opportunities to students of all abilities, all while making learning fun & engaging.", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}
{"id": "339", "text": "Most people know that jeans with flared bottoms like bootcut jeans or cowboy cut jeans are great choices for cowboy boots.\nThe reason is simple, they have enough room in the bottom legs for you to insert the boot shaft. And this is also a very popular style of most die-hard fans in the cowboy boots world.\nSo besides bootcut jeans, are there any other jeans suitable to wear with cowboy boots?\nToday’s post is the answer for you! You just need to grasp some basic principles, it’s very simple!\nLet’s check it out!\nIs it ok to wear normal jeans with cowboy boots?\nUsually, the most basic and preferred style of men when wearing cowboy boots is tucking the boot shaft into jeans. For this reason, the bottom legs of the jeans must be wide enough.\nIn fact, you don’t necessarily consider bootcut jeans the only option for this style, any type of jeans is fine, as long as the bottom legs have enough room to fit the boot shaft in and bring you a “smooth” look. The “smoothness” here means the V shape of the boot collar should not be imprinted on the surface of the jeans.\nJust knowing that basic, regular jeans or straight-leg jeans are both very good choices for men’s cowboy boots. They still give you the clean look you’ve always desired.\nToday, Wrangler, a major brand in jeans and other accessories, has released cowboy-cut jeans that are a great match to wear with cowboy boots. They have bottom legs that are not as wide as bootcut jeans but are still enough to tuck the boot shaft in and give you a more youthful style.\nAlso, some famous cowboy boot brands like Tecovas offer casual jeans that are great to wear with cowboy boots.\nStandard Jeans from Tecovas are not bootcut jeans, but they fit both your body shape and the boot shaft well.\nSome of my friends even wear slim jeans with cowboy boots. The way they make the boot shaft not print on the jeans is to use laces to tighten the boot shaft. Interesting, isn’t it? You can also do this with tapered jeans!\nBut for the same reason mentioned above, jeans like skinny or short jeans are not a good choice.\nSkinny jeans are often too narrow to fit over boots, whereas wearing cowboy boots over jeans can be impractical. Conversely, short jeans reveal the boot shaft, which is another style men usually don’t prefer. These two types of jeans are generally the least favored by men when wearing boots.\nThe world of men’s cowboy boots doesn’t like revealing boot shafts if your job doesn’t really force you to do so. They cause a contrast in style and do not offer a clean look or classic beauty as one would expect.\nMeanwhile, it’s a different story for women, they can wear… everything with cowboy boots. So in addition to bootcut jeans, other types such as regular jeans, straight-leg jeans, skinny jeans, low-rise rise or high-rise jeans are all great choices! As long as you coordinate your cowboy boots, jeans, and outfits in the right way.\nFor women, you don’t really need to care about what kind of jeans can go with cowboy boots, but pay attention to the harmony and match between outfits and boots. There are no strict rules for women like that for men in the cowboy boots world.\nIn general, do not be too rigid in style, you can completely use ordinary jeans like straight-leg jeans to wear with cowboy boots.\nNowadays, you will see men even wearing dress pants or suits with cowboy boots and that combination is absolutely amazing.\nJust for men, you need to stay away from exposing the boot shaft like tucking pants into boots or wearing shorts. Don’t make yourself silly. Also, make sure your jeans have enough room at the bottom for the boot shaft to fit in.\nFor women, wear whatever you want with cowboy boots! As long as they are harmonious, eye-catching, and fit your purpose, that’s it!\nHowdy y’all, and welcome to From The Guest Room, your ultimate guide to all things Western! I’m Jay Gatz, a lifelong cowboy boot enthusiast with over 5 years of experience in the Western style world. I’m excited to share my knowledge with you and help you discover the perfect cowboy boots and western gear to elevate your style.

{"id": "351", "text": "Titan Bet is one of the most popular bookies in the world, and virtually anyone who has ever placed a bet online will recognise the name; they’re reliable, trusted, and offer a fantastic range of online gambling products. If you’re not yet registered with them you would do well to check them out, and we’ll tell you why in the following post.\nAlthough we are focussing on the sports betting facilities today, Titan Bet offer a lot more than just this; they also run an online casino, online poker gaming, and instant win games. One account is sufficient to give you access to all of the various areas of the site, meaning you avoid the hassle of having to remember the details for multiple accounts.\nPOPULAR OFFERS & FEATURES\nTitan Bet run a couple of offers for you to take advantage of, and below we’ll cover the details of each of them and look at some of the main perks you can enjoy as a Titan Bet member.\nTITAN BET ACCA CLUB\nTitan Bet offer a very generous loyalty program which enables you to enjoy up to three great offers, all for simply placing a football bet on the site.\nThe three offers that make up the Titan Bet Club are shown below:\nOffer #1: Weekly £5 Acca – Simply place and settle a minimum of 5 X £5 bets on the football (all with 4+ selections) during the week, and you’ll enjoy a £5 free bet on Sunday to use on the football match of your choice. Free bets are credited to players’ accounts every Monday at midday on the dot, and there are very few limits as to what your free bet can be used on.\nOffer #2: Free Bet If 1 Lets You Down – If you place a 6 fold or higher accumulator on any of the qualifying markets/events and one selection loses, you’ll enjoy a free bet worth up to £25 to use on any football bets. Better yet, the free bet is issued just one hour after the initial bet is settled, meaning there’s no waiting around for this one.\nOffer #3: Cash Bonus on Winnings – Place an accumulator with 6 or more selections, and if the acca wins you’ll enjoy between 25% and 50% bonus winnings up to a maximum of a whopping £5,000. The bonus is credited to your account right away so you’ll see it almost instantly.\nAs you can see, Titan bet take their players’ satisfaction seriously, and the Bet Acca Club allows you to enjoy far more regular perks than most sites give you, on a range of football markets.\nWhile it’s probably a little annoying if you aren’t a big football fan, it’s still well-worth taking part in as the value is there.\nMONTHLY FREE BETS\nAs we’ve seen from a large number of bookies, monthly free bets are now becoming the norm as a way of rewarding punters, and Titan Bet are no different; in fact, they offer you the chance to earn up to £200 in free bets each and every month.\nHere’s how it works:\nFor every 20 x £10 bets you place (on Horse Racing or in-play sports such as Football, American Football, Basketball, Baseball, Tennis, Darts, Snooker, and Ice Hockey) you’ll be rewarded with a free £10 bet, and as you can claim this promotion up to 20 times a month there is potentially as much as £200 up for grabs.\nAs soon as you’ve hit the requirements you’ll see the bonus bet automatically added to your balance, and it’s then up to you as to which sport to use it on.\nTHE TITANBET WEBSITE\nTitan Bet offer one of the most well-built and unique websites around, and everything from the way in which you sign up and join the site to depositing and withdrawing is fully optimised to ensure your satisfaction. As you’ll see from some of the features and facilities we’re going to cover below, Titan Bet certainly know how to build a decent sports book.\nBefore we get into the sports book specifics, it’s worth noting that Titan Bet offer a huge range of other products, including an online casino, online poker facilities, and a few other areas too such as bingo, Live Dealer games, and a Macau section.\nIf you’re going to be sticking to sports betting then these probably won’t have much of an impact on your activities, but they’re worth pointing out, as many players do like to mix things up sometimes and dabble in other areas of the site.\nInside the online casino you’ll find a huge range of games – primarily from NetEntertainment – with some of the more popular titles being: Go Bananas, The Wish Master, Zombies, Reel Rush, Dazzle Me, Secrets of Atlantis, Muse, Fairytale Legends: Little Red Riding Hood, Wild Turkey, South Park: Reel Chaos, Steamtower, Elements the Awakening, Flowers: Christmas Edition, Alien Robots, Tornado: Farm Escape, Drive: Multiplier Mayhem, Robin Hood Shifting Reels, and many more.\nIf you prefer Live Dealer Games, then click ‘Live Casino’ from the top navigation menu and you’ll be able to play Roulette, Blackjack, Baccarat, and other casino table games, against a live dealer streamed directly to your screen in real time.\nOn the Titan Bet homepage you’ll see a tab named ‘Highlights’, and here you’ll be able to view all the highlights of the days betting markets. Titan Bet also showcase some of their best current promotions and bonuses here that you’re able to claim right away.\nThe site claims to use the latest technology to learn more about your betting habits, and this will then be used to display highlights on your feed that are relevant to you. While some players were initially a little concerned about privacy, Titan Bet assures punters that their betting preferences and personal information are safe, and will never be shared with anyone else.\nSports Betting at Titanbet\nTitanbet tend not to focus on a specific market, and instead they offer their punters a massive variety of markets to enjoy, from British classics like Horse Racing, Greyhounds, and Cricket; to international offerings, like American Football, MBA, NHL, and Aussie Rules Football.\nAll of the markets available can be accessed using the main navigation menu on the left-hand side of the page, and this allows you to view popular markets plus an ‘A-Z’ market list which provides a full breakdown of all available markets.\nIn all honesty, it’s pretty rare not to find the market that you want at Titanbet; and while it’s not quite up to the same levels as the biggest bookies, unless you’re looking for extremely niche events you should be all good.\nFootball is worth highlighting, as Titanbet offer a large selection of bet coupons and pre-made coupons (such as both teams to score in both halves) which means you can drastically cut down on the amount of time spent browsing events and adding individual selections to your bet slip.\nThe unusual sports markets available include Water Polo, Volleyball, GAA, and Wrestling; the latter of which is very rare indeed due to fears of insider betting, with the sport being admittedly fixed.\nOne thing that becomes clear quickly on the Titanbet website, is that they are really getting stuck in as far as betting offers are concerned, and they have marketed themselves well as a prime platform for football bets. Other sports markets have not been left by the wayside however, and it is possible to place over 8,000 bet variations for more than 20 different sports types during high season. All in all, Titanbet is able to fulfil all of the important review criteria for bet offers, making them a genuine competitor for the top dogs in sports betting.\nThe Football markets cover nations at least to the third leagues, and another focus, even within live bets, is on Tennis.\nTitanbet also get additional points for its U.S. sports (American Football, Baseball & Basketball), but only in terms of quantity as there are no interesting special bets to be found here.\nHow Good are the Odds?\nA simple search of various comparison sites shows Titanbet ranking merely average when it comes to prices, and if you frequent online forums you may well have seen the bookie criticised for their stingy odds, especially on Football markets.\nIt seems Titanbet have embraced this feedback, however, restructuring their business in order to offer more generous and dynamic odds; but still, they struggling to compete with the major players in the industry whose prices and deals can’t often be beaten.\nIn an attempt to compete, Titanbet have recently added a ‘Best Price Guaranteed’ section of the site, which guarantees you the best price for your selection. For example, if you place a bet on a horse with odds of 8/1, and the horse starts the race at 10/1, you’d get odds of 10/1 on your bet if it won.\nIn Play Betting\nSince first opening the in-play betting centre Titanbet have put a lot of effort into developing their live markets, and 6 years since its initial launch, the bookie has gone on to create a platform that’s enjoyed by thousands of players every hour. There are even sound effects relating to real time game info (the ref’s whistle for example).\nTo begin with, the in-play markets offered were a little threadbare, but they have managed to continually add new markets with recent additions including Volleyball, Golf, and Tennis.\nTitanbet also boast a number of unique Asian markets. A full explanation of how these differ to some of the markets you may already be familiar with can be found in the ‘Best Features’ section later on in this post.\nAsian Handicap Betting Odds\nAs with some of our other reviews, we’re going to focus on just one just area here; the Asian Handicap Betting Odds. While we briefly covered this earlier, we want to talk a bit more about what Asian Handicaps actually are, and why Titanbet are a recommended choice if you’re looking to place odds on any of the Asian markets.\nAt this point you might well be wondering: What are Asian Handicap betting odds?\nPut simply, they’re odds developed in Asia that are worked out in a different way, offering punters a higher chance of winning when compared to conventional odds (which could include things like betting outright, each-way, etc).\nLet’s use a football match as an example: Before the game begins, both teams are given a handicap which can be either positive or negative. They are in decimal format, so a positive handicap could be +0.5, while a negative handicap may look like -1.5 – basically, it’s a handicap of goals.\nIf you saw a team with a handicap of -2.0, therefore, it would mean they essentially start the match 2-0 down. This would mean that your team would need to score, and be clear, at least three goals before the end of the match. If the team you pick manages to do so, you win.\nSo what’s so special about the Asian markets at Titanbet?

{"id": "352", "text": "Days Gone 2 could've released last month, says director\n| Last updated\nFeatured Image Credit: Sony Interactive Entertainment\nThe tale of Days Gone 2 is one that gets sadder and sadder the more is revealed about it.\nFor those unfamiliar, Bend Studio’s post-apocalyptic action-adventure game was supposed to get a sequel, back in the day. However, in 2021 it was reported that despite the game’s success, Sony turned down a pitch for the sequel back in 2019. Since then, fans have been begging for Sony to reconsider to little avail.\nTake a look at the story trailer for Days Gone below.\nIf you were already disappointed about Days Gone 2 being, uh, gone, this latest update from the original game’s director is going to add some serious salt to the wound. As Push Square reports, following last night’s PlayStation Showcase presentation, Jeff Ross tweeted: “I get a little bummed out from these PlayStation Showcase shows because they only remind me we could [have] had Days Gone 2 out a month ago if we'd have just stuck to our guns.”\nI get a little bummed out from these #PlayStationShowcase shows because they only remind me we could of had Days Gone 2 out a month ago if we'd have just stuck to our guns.— Jeff Ross (@JakeRocket) May 25, 2023\nWhat’s more, in the same thread, Ross teased that the sequel would have boasted “cool world systems to create some great emergent gameplay”, and it honestly hurts to think about the fact that we were robbed of it. When asked why he and the team can’t still push for it to happen, he replied: “Too much time has passed, and over 90 people from the original team have left the studio. And Sony just doesn't seem to care for it.”\nUnderstandably, Days Gone fans are gutted: “Bums me out just reading your post. Especially if they would have stuck to the co-op feature it would have been amazing,” Twitter user @JD52436357 replied. “I was so excited for a sequel after getting the Plat, Days Gone 2 would have been incredible,” added @KalidusX.\nEven though all seems lost, Ross added that there’s still “a chance” that the sequel could happen one day, even though he claims that the odds of it happening are “one in a million”.", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

{"id": "355", "text": "Four Surprising Causes Of\nIf you are experiencing regular neck pain that just won’t\ngo away, it’s possible that parts of your daily routine are contributing\nwithout you realising. Here are a few common everyday activities that might be\nmaking your neck pain worse.\n1. Your sleeping position\nIt’s easy to underestimate the impact your sleeping position has however,\nspending hours in one position will undoubtedly have an effect on your body.\nPillows that are too high or too flat can mean your cervical joints are sitting\nat the end of their range in too much flexion or extension. Similarly, sleeping\non your stomach often means your thoracic spine is locked into extension and\nyour neck is fully rotated. In simpler terms, this means your joints are under\nmore stress than necessary. Ideal sleeping posture allows your spine to\nmaintain it’s natural curves.\n2. Your daily commute\nMany of us make sure our work stations are ergonomically set up to reduce\nstress and strain throughout the day. Few of us take the same consideration\nwhen it comes to driving. In fact, the set up of your car can be just as\nimportant as your work-desk, particularly if you are driving more than 30\nminutes everyday. The correct setup in your car can mean you use less effort to\ndrive and turn your head less often to check traffic.\nEnsuring that your steering wheel, seat and mirrors are set up correctly\ncould make a difference to your posture and even perhaps reduce neck pain and\nheadaches. If you find that driving is still affecting your pain after making\nthese changes, try catching public transport or riding a bike on alternative\n3. Your downtime\nMany of us\nunwind by watching TV or our laptops at the end of the day. Your position\nduring this time can be something you give little thought to however, looking\nup to view a screen mounted on a wall or looking down at a small screen or\nlaptop can put pressure on the upper structures of the neck. Take a few minutes\nto consider what posture you’re sitting in before settling down to binge watch\na series and see if you can either lower the height of your screen or raise it\nslightly so your neck can be in a more neutral position.\n4. Your exercise routine\nAny activity that requires sustained positions or repetitive neck\nmovements can contribute to neck pain. Cyclists can be stuck in neck extension\nwhile looking ahead and breast stroke swimmers can also have excess neck\nextension. Freestyle swimmers with reduced thoracic or neck rotation can have\ndifficulty achieving rotation when breathing which can cause pain and\ndiscomfort over time.\nIf you need any further information about neck pain then click\n, or call the clinic on 028 92666959, or email email@example.com\nYour physiotherapist is able to\nidentify any daily habits or activities that might be contributing to your neck\npain. Come and see us for an appointment to see how we can help. None of the information in this article is a\nreplacement for proper medical advice.

{"id": "357", "text": "Section 4 – FOREIGN – Group 2\nThe intriguing Sphynx cat never fails to draw a reaction from people and is certainly something of a conversation piece – some people love the bald, wrinkled look, some are fascinated by the cat, while others are less than enthusiastic! The most distinctive feature of the cat is its lack of fur.\nThe Sphynx is of medium size, boning and body conformation with surprising weight for its size. The head shape is a modified wedge, with prominent cheekbones and whisker pads. The body is warm and soft to the touch, with a chamois leather-like texture to the skin. The Sphynx is sweet-tempered, lively, intelligent and amenable to handling.\nThe Sphynx cat first appeared in Ontario, Canada in 1966 when a black and white domestic shorthair named Elizabeth gave birth to a litter of kittens which included a hairless male. His name was Prune and, when he was old enough, he was mated back to his mother which resulted in a litter of coated and hairless kittens, some of which were exported to Europe and acquired the breed’s name. In 1988, the first Sphynx to enter the UK from Holland was a four year old female called Tulip. Tulip became a great ambassador for the breed and was put on exhibition at three GCCF shows where she gained much admiration from the public. Tulip lived to be over fifteen years old.\nDespite appearances, the Sphynx is not a totally naked cat. Their body is covered with a soft down, which is almost imperceptible to both the eye and the touch. The texture of the skin is likened to that of a warm peach or a chamois cloth. Sphynx have some fine hair over the bridge of their nose and on their feet. This can also be found on their tails and the back of the ears – and on the scrotum of the males. Degree of coat depends on several factors e.g. climate, hormones and hereditary predispositions. Their bodies are warmer to the touch than that of other cats but, in fact, their temperature is no higher. Sphynx are very clever and they will pop under a blanket when it is getting cold or find a warm human body or dog or cat to curl up with. Kittens are very wrinkly but as they develop they grow into their skin, maintaining some of the wrinkles, especially on the head. Sphynx are indoor cats as they can easily get burnt by the sun and have little protection should they come across a feisty neighbourhood cat. They can go out under supervision and weather permitting, ideally on a harness, in an enclosed safe garden or a purpose-built run. Males are generally 25% larger then the females and they come in all colours and patterns.\nThe Sphynx cat is possibly one of the most affectionate, sociable and intelligent cats in the world. They are in your face 24/7 and very much ‘people cats’. They will greet you, snuggle up and sleep with you and you will have no say in the matter whatsoever. Vocal, almost to the point where you find yourselves having a two-way conversation, Sphynx hate being alone. They can learn to play fetch and love to play. They enjoy the company of children and other animals and make a wonderful addition to any family that is prepared to lavish the time and attention they crave. The Sphynx is very outgoing and they are often described by their owners as elf-like or child-like due to their inquisitive and intelligent nature. They crave human company and can often be found following their owners around the house. They live quite happily with other cats and dogs. As they are so gregarious they should never be kept as the only cat in a household – but should have some form of feline company, ideally another Sphynx.\nAs the Sphynx lacks a coat, body oils cannot be absorbed by the fur but these can be removed by bathing, which most Sphynx seem to enjoy. Attention should be given to their ears and feet as they can get very dirty with wax but are cleaned easily with cotton buds (but do be careful not to go into the ear canal with a bud). Sphynx are not delicate and, contrary to popular belief, do not require extra heat; in fact, this will make them sweat more. An ordinary cat bed with a blanket that they can wrap up in is perfectly acceptable. Female Sphynx cats weight 6 to 8 lbs and male Sphynx cats weigh 8 to 11 lbs. They usually require a slightly higher caloric intake than other breeds because their bodies are constantly working hard to keep them warm. Sphynx cats have a lifespan of 15 years or more.\nThe Sphynx is not a hypoallergenic cat despite the claims of some people. If you are allergic to the proteins in a cat’s saliva, you will be allergic to the Sphynx as well. Some people who are allergic to cats do tolerate the Sphynx breed better than normal coated cats. Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (HCM) has been reported to affect young to middle aged Sphynx cats. The certain disease is usually discovered during a routine annual health check. The vet will hear a faster heart rate and perhaps congestion sounds in the lungs, while the pulse feels weak. Luckily, HCM can be treated with special medical care. However, breeding only from Sphynx that are free from this gene will ensure that they will not develop the form of HCM associated with it.", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}

He left his great inheritance to his four sisters, and their descendants. The eldest married Robert De Tatstall, Isabell married John FitzAlan, Nichola married Roger Somery, and Cecilia married Roger Monthault, insomuch as that in the 28th year of Henry the Third, Cecilia had the Castle and Manor of Rising in Norfolk with Coventry, and held many great Lordships.\nRoger De Monthault was one of the Earl of Chester's Barons, and Seneschall of Chester in the 30th year of Henry the Third having a Charter of Free Warren dated the 26th of March of that year, and in the 33rd year of Henry the Third Geoffrey De Langley made a suit with him for diverting a stream in Coventry from its original concourse. In the 34th year of Henry the Third, he intended visiting the holy Land, and to assist him he was furnished with a large amount of money by the Monks of Coventry, for which consideration with Cecilia his wife, of whose inheritance was joined along with the Advowson of St. Michael Church, and Chapelrys thereto belonging to the said Monks in Fee Ferme, in which sale were exerted to them and to their heirs their Manor House at Cheylesmore with the enclosed Park and the Religious House, or Frier's Minor, situated near to the said Park, along with the Advowson of Sponne Hospital, having Free Liberty to the said Roger Monthault and heirs whenever they should visit Coventry for hunting and hawking within the precincts of the said Manor.\nA Fine levied in the 34th year of Henry the Third, by Roger De Monthault a Cecilia for Warranty of the afore mentioned premises was so granted, Cecilia in her widowhood by her Deed of Release quit all he interest of the said Manor as also the Hospital and Chapel of Sponne, sometime pertaining to the Abbey of Basing in Flint.\nAfter this in the 3rd year of Edward the First, upon the extent of the Manor after the death of Robert De Monthault, the son and heir of the afar mentioned Roger, the Manor House, with the Park, and the Mill, were valued at five Marks per annum, the rent thereto £39.9.7d.\nIn the 9th year of the Reign of Edward the Second, the Prior of Coventry and Robert De Monthault were certified Lords of this Place which Robert, being brother and heir to Roger, the son of the last mentioned Robert with Emme his wife, and in the First year of Edward the Third levied a Fine of all Interests here, by the name of the Manor of Cheylesmore of £96.6.8d yearly rent.\nLeofries was not only Earl of Leicester but the Earl of Mercia, and married the legendary Lady Godiva, who rode through the streets of Coventry naked, thus entering the Stratford Pedigree on the maternal side.\nThe Pedigree is shown thus.\nLeofricus Comes Leicester temp Ethelred Rigis Mercia AD 716\nAlgarus Primus above 836, Wiglaff the King of Mercians.\nAlgarus Secundus above 860, beorred King of Mercians but slain at Ketheven by\nDanes in 870 /\nLeofwinus Comes, about the year 1,000 under King Ethelred\nLeofricus, Count of Mercia founder of Coventry Abbey, died 13th Conf, married\nGoditha dau of Thorold, Earl of Leicester. /\nAlgaraus, Earl of mercia died 1059.\nLucia, married her first cousin Ranulphus De Bricaford, Earl of Chester\nRanulphus, Earl of Chester. /\nHugo, Earl of Chester, leaving no issue, his co-heiress including his sister Cecilia\nwho married Robert De Monthault.\nThe two are obviously the same Family as their Coat Armour is identical except that Sir Andrew had a Bordure Or for difference indicating he was a younger son.\nThe issue of Sir Stephen Stratford and Elizabeth Monthault was John, where it is recorded that he married Maud, the daughter of Sir Henry Ceeley Knight, of the County of Nottingham.\nThe Ceeley Family was of Norman Descent, the head of the Pedigree being :e Sire Ce Gaulle, who came over with the Duke of Normandy in 1066. From the former was descended Sir Benedict Ceeley, living during the reign of King Edward the Third, distinguishing himself under the Black Prince. His son, Sir Henry Ceeley, a large wool Merchant, purchased an Estate in the Cotswold area of Gloucestershire.\nJohn Stratford's direct son and heir, was Henry who married Margaret Loudham whose Pedigree is as follows. Richard Barwell of the County of Leicester had a son and heir, Richard, who married Eleanor, the daughter and heiress of William Stoke. They had issue of a daughter and heiress who married Rafe Loudham. Margaret was the daughter and heiress of this marriage. At his death Henry's heir was John Stratford, who married Elizabeth Stenmarsh, the daughter of John Stenmarsh of the County of Stafford. They left issue of a son and heir Sir John Stratford.\nSir John Stratford, was buried at the Priory of the Holy Trinity in London, an had married the daughter and heiress of Henry Eyton, by Catherine his wife. She had been the co-heiress of Thomas Langley the son of Sir Henry Langley, and it is the quartering of these Family Arms which were presented and accepted at the Herald's Visitations of Gloucestershire as previously recited.\nDuring the Reign of Henry the Third, at Pinley, Geoff De Langley, a man of great note, at this time made it his seat, probably due to the nearness to Coventry, for in the 22nd year of Henry the Third, he had a grant from the King of certain timber and trees out of the Kenilworth Woods for the building of his house,. which became the chief seat of the Family.\nThe first of note of the Family was in Henry the Second's time, when the King confirmed a Grant made by one Geoff De Langley, to the Monks of Combe, named Hendeberg, in the County of Warwick, and it is likely that he was the father of the afore said Geoff De Langley. The Geoff De Langley Senior was the first Marshal of the King's Household, an office normally belonging to the Earl Marshal of England in Fee, who, with the King's consent, would appoint a Knight under him to execute the same. He appeared to be so efficient at this task and thrifty that the King held him in some great respect, although others did not hold him in such awe as he cut back on allowances for the King's Table and lessened the hospitality at Court.\nIn the 23rd year of Henry the Third's Reign, he obtained a Charter of Free Warren in all his lands and in the 26th year of Henry the Third, he attended the King on his expedition to Gascoign, where his reputation again further profited and advanced. In the 34th year of Henry the Third he obtained a Patent to his own use, dated the 29th of December, of benefit accruing by expedition of dogs throughout all the forests of England, and on the following 4th of March he became Justice of the King's Forests from the Trent southwards. A few days later he was appointed Governor of the Castle and Honour of Rockingham in Northamptonshire, and had a Licence to stop up and enclose a certain highway which interposed between his house and the woods at Pinley.\nAn author wrote:\nAbout these times, saith he, a certain Knight, called Geoffrey De Langley, who was Bailiff to the King and a strict Inquisitor after all trespasses committed in forests, rode through most parts of England. In which office he behaved himself with cunning, forwardness and violence, in extorting vast sums of money especially from the Northern Gentry, as that the very Auditors themselves were astonished at such a mass. And for the better carrying on this course of operation he rode with a great company of attendants, all well armed, so that if any of those against whom he proceeded did but seem to excuse themselves in a muttering way, their enemy's being Judges, he presently caused them to be cast into prison. Neither did he use any proportion in the punishment suitable to the offence, for, were it but the killing of a fawn or a hare, and that crossing the way in a man's passage, though he were a great Nobleman that did it, he would ruin him. So that his cruelty made the memory of his predecessors precious.\nA younger son of his was in the Welsh expedition along with his brother Walter in the 41st year of Henry the Third. Walter obtained a special exemption from serving on any juries so long as he lived. He died leaving a son and heir, John De Langley, 22 years of age and a younger son Robert. Sir Henry Langley afore mentioned, was in direct descent of the afore said Geoffrey De Langley.\nThe Family of Eyton, were living at a very early period at Eyton on the Wyldmores, and are presumed from their Armorial Bearings, to have been of the early Vassals of Pantule, Baron Wem, who was the mesne Lord of Eyton, at the time of the Domesday Book Survey. The first named of the Pedigree is Robert De Eyton, who witnessed a Grant to Robert Corbet to the Abbey of Shrewsbury, together with William, Alan, and Hugh, sons of Hugh Pantule, and Granted himself that Religious House, the lands of Buttery, during the Reign of Henry the Second. The ninth in descent from Robert was John De Eyton, Sheriff of Shropshire in 1394, who had issue of the afore mentioned Henry Eyton. Sir John Stratford and Catherine Eyton left issue of a son and heir, Robert Stratford who married Anne, the daughter and heiress of Nicholas Attwood of the County of Stafford, leaving issue of a son and heir, Richard Stratford.\nAt the Herald's Visitations of Gloucestershire in 1543, Richard Stratford then described as of Farmcote and Hawling, replied to the College the recorded and accepted fore going Pedigree, adding the Pedigree currently living at the time. Richard Stratford, living in 1484, married Frances the daughter of Thomas Kirkeby, leaving a son and heir, John Stratford.\nThe afore mentioned John Stratford, was known as of Farmcote, and married Margaret, the daughter of Richard Howell, dying in 1553, being at that time the Lord of the Manor of Farmcote, Hawling, Guiting Power, Temple Guiting, Sudeley, Hailes, Wyck Rissington, Upper Swell, Cold Aston, and Aston Blank. He was one of the Commissioners along with Richard Tracy responsible for the Dissolution of Hailes Abbey. His second son William, was responsible for a large number of descendants. One married into the Rouse Family of Rouse Lench, Rutters of Quinton, and on married Thomas Whitmore of the Pantry of Charles the Second, another son William was slain in a Duel by Holte of London. The second son William Stratford, married secondly into the Walwyn Family and the Arms of Stratford and Walwyn are still above the old doorway at Farmcote Manor House. This marriage amongst other descent, was responsible for the Walford Branch of the Stratford's in Herefordshire, near Ross on Wye.\nThe Walwyn's are of very Ancient descent from Gwallain of Walwyn Castle in Pembrokeshire of which Family was Sir Philip Walwyn who had certain lands assigned to him by William Rufus. The eleventh in direct descent from Sir Philip was John Walwyn of Longford who married Agnes, the daughter and co-heir of Simon Milborne, and had nine sons and three daughters. The eighth son , George, married Anne, the daughter of Simon Beaumont Esquire of Oxfordshire, and had issue of Edward of Southam, who married Christiana, the daughter of John Stratford of Farmcote. The ninth son married Brina, the daughter of Bridges of Hall Court, having issue of Anne, who married the afore mentioned William Stratford of Farmcote.\nThe third son of John Stratford and Margaret Howell was Richard of Hawling, whose son and grandsons married into the Cole Family, Bannisters of Turkdean, the De La Bere Family, and the Dovers of Cotswold Games fame. Through these marriages can be traced a relationship with the Bard William Shakespeare.\nMy main concern is now to continue with the direct descent from John Stratford, Archbishop of Canterbury, and myself, and all i am attempting to at this point is relating to the reader the origination and relationships with other notable families.\nThe eldest son of John Stratford and Margaret Howell, was another John Stratford, who married Margaret, the daughter of Sir Robert Tracy of Toddington in Gloucestershire. the Family of Tracy has so much history peculiar to itself that i will dwell on my maternal descent through this Family in a separate chapter later on.\nJohn Stratford and Margaret Tracy, had a son and heir, Henry, whom I will deal with shortly. Their second son was Richard, third son George, fourth Edward, fifth Charles, and the sixth Gyles of London. Gyles and his wife both died young leaving issue of two sons. These children were fostered by his brother Anthony, whom Mr. Pullman refers to in his letter to William Dugdale mentioned earlier. Anthony became Lord of the manor of Bushley, near Tewkesbury. One of the sons was the founder of the Merevale Branch of the Stratford Family, and eventually the Earldom of Aldborough, County Kildare, in the Kingdom of Ireland. The seventh son was John, the tobacco grower, and the eighth was Anthony, Lord of the manor of Bushley, who married Margaret Haywood. they had issue and this branch settled in this place until the Manor was sold to the Dowderswell Family, and the house, namely Payn's Place.\nHis nephew, Sir William Tracy, lived with them for a time at Bushley, and a descendent of Anthony's was killed at the Battle of Worcester, in the Royalist cause during the Civil War. An entry in the Parish register of Bushley reads.\nAnthony Stratford, Gentleman, who although he was not buried, was not with standing, not to be forgotten, or left out of this place, for that ye remembrance of this man will not easily be forgotten. I have not heard of any man that was buried within forty years that his death was made lamented by all sorts of people than this man was. He died on horse back, riding towards Stanway in Gloucestershire and was buried in Stanway Church on the 16th of March 1608.\nHe had married Margaret Haywood at Bushley on the 26th of April 1577. Another brother William, is not mentioned by the Herald's but in a deed of complaint he is stated as residing in Bristol, and a most unsavoury character.\nThe son and heir of John Stratford and Margaret Tracy was Henry who married Mary the daughter of John Maire of the County of Chester. He was in London when press ganged into the Navy, and died under Capt Shackley at the Siege of Ostend, but he left issue of a son and heir John Stratford of Farmcote. This John Stratford married Mary Throgmorton, the daughter of Sir Anthony Throgmorton, thus formulating a relationship with Sir Walter Raleigh. It was probably through this relationship that the Stratford family cultivated tobacco in the Cotswolds, which of course is another story. They had five sons, George his heir, Robert who served with Sir Francis Drake and died on one of his expeditions, Anthony who emigrated to Ireland, and was possibly the gentleman described as the Governor of Fort Dungannon, John, known as John of Prestbury, and who was responsible for that branch of the Stratford's, and Henry.\nGeorge Stratford, the eldest son and her of John Stratford and Mary Throgmorton, was known as of Sudeley. In fact he married at Didbrook Parish Church on the 1st of October 1601, Elizabeth the daughter of William Hobby of Hailles Abbey. This William Hobby was buried at Didbrook on the 17th of March 1602, aged 103 years old, making him being born in 1499. George Stratford was buried at Didbrook on the 19th of December 1632. Again there are several Cadet Branches descended from George Stratford and Elizabeth Hobby.\nThe son and heir of the afar mentioned George and Elizabeth, was William Stratford who was baptised at Didbrook on the 25th of August 1602, and buried at Farmcote on the 13th of September 1682. He served as a Royalist during the Civil war in the 18th Regiment of Foot, and in 1640 he was described as an Ensign, with a retiring Rank of Major. He billeted Prince Rupert's Cavalry at Farmcote, and entertained the Prince their on the night prior to the Battle of Edgehill. he was sequested for £763 for his Estates by Parliament.\nHe married firstly Anne the daughter of Moore of Payne's Farm, Cockerup, having issue by her which resulted in the Stratford Branches of Milham Post, and Swindon Village, Cheltenham, with Francis Paul Stratford, Master in Chancery of Bedford Square and Thorpe Lubenham Hall being one of his descendents.\nWilliam Stratford married secondly Lady Magdeline Overbury, his eldest son's mother in law, and the widow of Sir Walter Overbury, and married thirdly Susannah Leigh, the widow of George Leigh of Longborough, and she was buried in the Chancel of Shipton Sollers Parish Church beside her first husband.\nThe son and heir of William Stratford and Anne Moore was William Stratford baptised at Farmcote on the 26th of April 1635, and married at Barton on the Heath on the 30th of November 1665, Anne, the daughter of Sir Water and lady Magdeline Overbury, and being buried at Farmcote on the 23rd of July 1711.\nHe was described in his later life as living at Little Farmcote. This Family relationship of course, relates the maternal descent with the famous mystery of Sir Thomas Overbury, who was subject of murder and intrigue in the Tower of London. The eldest son of William Stratford and Anne Overbury was baptised at Walford on the 28th of March 1668, but appears not to have survived as Walter Overbury Stratford was their heir, although there was another younger brother Thomas and a daughter Anne. the Family of Overbury will be dealt with in a later Chapter.\nWalter Overbury Stratford, was baptised at Barton on the Heath on the 16th of December 1672, and was responsible for the financial downfall of the Main Stock of the family, and it was during his lifetime that the Farmcote Estate was Mortgaged, but in his defence he was buried at Farmcote on the 1st of July 1753 and the Estate was not finally given up until 1754, being sold in 1756.\nWalter Overbury Stratford, married firstly Anne, the daughter of Charles Guillam of Woodmancote in 1700, having a son George who died, Mary who never married, and Anne who married William Lawrence of Sevenhampton. Anne Guillam died and Water Overbury Stratford married secondly Frances the daughter of John Bapters of Bristol, and Anne Charmont, known as Bapters, alias Draghay, with issue of nine sons.\nThe eldest son John Overbury Stratford died in infancy, and the second son, William was baptised at Guiting Power on the 8th of September 1715, lived in London and died in 1782, leaving issue of William his son and his grandson William Samuel Stratford, Secretary of the Astrological Society, born in 1790, and the Branch eventually died out with John Farmcote Henry Stratford who provided brass's and an Altar Cross for Guiting Power Parish Church and Farmcote Chapel.\nOther sons of Walter Overbury Stratford and Frances, were Walter, baptised 7th of April 1716, Thomas whom we shall look at later, Edward baptised 12th July 1718. Ferdinando, baptised 4th July 1719, a Surveyor, of London who Surveyed the Hawling Estates, Anthony, who went to America, baptised on the 17th of February 1720, Francis baptised 14th January 1722, and George who was baptised on the 2nd of July 1724, all at Guiting Power Parish Church. George Stratford, the youngest son, lived at Wootton Warwen, and was buried there in April 1791. He was the founder of the Birmingham and Sheffield Branches.\nThomas Stratford, the fourth son of Walter Overbury Stratford and Frances Bapters was baptised at Guiting Power on the 9th of June 1717, and married by Banns, on the 20th of January 1745, Sarah Davis of Bisley, and resided there until his death, being buried there on the 14th of March 1784. He left issue of at least four sons, and a daughter, including William Stratford, my Great Great Great Grandfather.\nWilliam Stratford afore mentioned was born at Bisley in 1748, and married firstly on the 28th of October 1771 at Charlton Abbott's Anne Painter, who was buried at Sevenhampton on the 10th of November 1791. They had no issue, and William married secondly on the 16th of November 1795, Mary Acock, but a baptism is recorded of a William Stratford the son of William Stratford and Mary Acock previous to their marriage on the 14th of June 1795. This afore mentioned William married and settled at Prestbury having amongst other issue Thomas, who married Mary Burford, and she died shortly after having a daughter Elizabeth, who was brought up at Sevenhampton by Sarah Ellis the sister of the said William, ie. Thomas's father. William Stratford and Mary Acock had other issue of Thomas, who is described later and Richard an Ironmonger at Condicote when he died in 1865.\nFurther issue of this Marriage was Sarah whom I have just described, whose descendent Sandra Hands now resides at Fareham, Hants, and Martha who died very young, and Mary Acock never recovered from a difficult birth.\nThomas Stratford my Great Great Grandfather was baptised at Sevenhampton on the 14th of April 1797, and married Mary Hill of Liskeard. He died on the 26th of march 1869, at Swindon Village, Cheltenham, the birthplace of his mother. He enlisted in the Royal Marines at Plymouth on the 22nd of January 1824, and by the 9th of March 1844 had served 21 years and was still serving, they left issue of three sons, and two daughters, one son of which was my Great Grandfather, John George Stratford who was born at East Stonehouse, Plymouth, on the 1st of August 1834.\nJohn George Stratford joined his father on H.M.S. Druid, aged 7 years, on the 10th of August 1841, and was admitted to the Lower School. Greenwich on the 19th of August 1845. He married on the 6th of September 1855, Mary Anne Day, at St. George's, East Stonehouse. He died on the 12th of March 1867, of Pethesis at the age of 33 years. He left issue of Mary, born in 1862, who never married, Priscilla born in 1860, who married Thomas Corner of Dawlish, and my Grandfather William Richard Thomas Stratford.\nWilliam Richard Thomas Stratford, was born at East Stonehouse on the 28th of February 1865, and married Nellie Comer of Dawlish on the 21st of December 1890. as you may have gathered, brother and sister married brother and sister. He was twice Mayor of Truro, and Lord Mayor, a Headmaster of a Public School, a Provincial Grand Master of the Grand Masonic Lodge and a friend of Edward the Eighth. He died on the 2nd of February 1953, being buried at Kenwyn, Truro, leaving issue of four sons, William O'Grady Stratford, Willie Stratford, my father Gerald Stratford, and Alan John Stratford. My father Gerald Stratford was a Brevet Colonel in the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, and a Headmaster, born on the 18th of February 1896, and married Frances Mabel Howland, the daughter of Leonard Howland who at that time was General Manager of the Carron Iron and Steel works in Scotland, on the 13th of July 1918, and died at Dinnington on the 1st of February 1955, leaving issue of myself and an older brother.\nI was born at Dinnington on the 3rd of June 1934, and married Rita May Hodkin the daughter of Sydney James Hodkin a builder on the 26th of February 1955.", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}
{"id": "363", "text": "Recently, in a conversation with one of the founders of Malucette, I learnt something extremely interesting — how they use Instagram voice messages when they reach out to some of the ambassadors they want to work with.\nThat’s when I realised that voice messages are actually a hugely underrated tool when trying to create relationships with people. And it’s not like they are new — voice messages were first launched in 1980 in the US. They’ve been around for 40 years.\nBut they’re making a comeback. Society shifted away from making calls towards sending text messages (Gen Z and millennials HATE phone calls. Some people won’t even pick up a call from an unrecognised number.) and now in a similar way, people are shifting away from writing texts to sending voice messages.\nI can already see this in my own friend group. They’re quicker, easier to send, and you can express more emotion in a voice message than in a text. In one word, they’re more authentic.\nAnd if there’s anything we’ve learnt here at Selling Social, it’s that to really resonate with your community today, authenticity is key.\nLet’s learn how to use voice messages to create deeper relationships with your community.\nWhether we like it or not, voice is back. Our friends and families are voice messaging us, podcasts are becoming more and more popular, apps like Clubhouse became an actual thing.\nThe reason for this is that voice is an in-between between video and text — it allows us to express more emotions than in text, but without the naked-ness of video. And post-pandemic it’s a great compromise.\nBut what matters for us that brands aren’t really on sending voice messages yet. And so when you receive one, your brain thinks it’s “from a friend”.\nVoice messages will work because of the same reason that UGC ads work, the same reason that Reels and TikToks work — they are authentic. They aren’t mass-produced, they aren’t automated.\nAnd so when a high-ticket ambassador or influencer receives a personalised voice message that a real person took 60 seconds to record, they are more likely to pay attention.\nVoice messages are also a great vibe-check. You can get a really great idea of what the person behind the brand is like — it’s not for no reason that people are actually using voice notes to vet their online dates beforehand. Dating apps like Hinge have also added voice prompts to give users a better idea of what the person behind the profile is like.\nPeople love the sound of their own name. This is the most important part — this is how the person listening to your message knows that the message is truly for them.\nStart the message by greeting your recipient by name, like you would a friend.\nYour tone of voice should be what you would use if you were sending a message to the guy (or girl) whose number you got at a party.\nYou don’t want to be formal, you don’t want to be corporate — you’re trying to chat someone up! Be friendly. If you make a mistake or fumble on some words, acknowledge it “HAHA looks like I’m too excited” and move on with the message.\nNo one likes to listen to a long voice message that goes on and on. Keep it concise. Instagram has a limit of 60 seconds, and with good reason.\nSay something that you noticed about their feed. Something about what you noticed in a story they posted recently. Something that shows them that you’re actually paying attention, and they’re not just a to-do item to check off.\nThis goes a long way. The same thing applies for sending a cold DM as well.\nThis is important. Your message has a purpose. State it.\nMake it clear to the other person why you’re reaching them, what you want them to do, and what’s in it for them.\nThis is where you want to be different from how you would be if you were voice messaging a friend.\nEnd the message like you would an old-school voice message — “alright, have a great day! bye bye!”\nFor all kinds of practical information such as email IDs or specific instructions, send a text. That way it’s more clear.\nYou don’t want to go in and hit the record button completely unprepared.\nIn order to prepare to send out your voice messages to your prospects, I recommend writing bullet points about the things you want to cover, but not scripting it outright. You still want to maintain some spontaneity when recording.\nYou’re not going to be sending voice notes to every ambassador or influencer you want to reach out to, otherwise you’re going to go crazy and spend all day!\nLeaving voice messages is bound to get your reply rate up when you’re reaching out to potential ambassadors. Have you tried using voice messages before? How have you done it? What has worked for you? I’d love to know.\nEmail me at mayank at getubu dot com and let me know your thoughts!", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}

{"id": "368", "text": "“Though he brings grief, he will show compassion, so great is his unfailing love. For he does not willingly bring affliction or grief to the children of men.”\nWhen my paralyzing accident happened, I know the Lord took no pleasure in it. I believe it pained his heart to see me hurt, just as any father has compassion on his child. Yet I also know it pleased the Lord to permit my accident. He was as delighted then as he is now to work it all out for my good and his glory. Sound confusing? I can understand why: in some Scriptures God is described as grieving over affliction; in others it doesn’t seem to bother him.\nDr. John Piper explains it this way: God has the capacity to look at the world through two lenses, a narrow lens and a wide-angle lens. When the Lord looks at a painful event through the narrow lens, he sees the tragedy for what it is in itself, and he is deeply grieved, as Ezekiel 18:32 says: “I take no pleasure in the death of anyone, declares the Sovereign LORD.” He hates the isolated incident of disease, crime, or violence.\nBut when God looks at a painful event through his wide-angle lens, he sees the tragedy in relation to everything leading up to it, as well as everything that flows from it. He has in mind Romans 8:28, “In all things God works for the good of those who love him,” and Ephesians 1:11, “…according to the plan of him who works out everything in conformity with the purpose of his will.” The connections form a mosaic stretching into eternity. This mosaic—in all its parts of good and evil, dark and light—brings him delight.\nGod often wills what he despises, because he has two lenses. You can trust him today that your painful trial is part of a pattern. One day you too will put on that wide-angle lens. When you do, what a beautiful mosaic you will see.\nMy shortsightedness, Lord, keeps me from seeing how pain can result in good.

{"id": "370", "text": "What do you collect?\nI gather envelopes, postcards and other objects that regularly traveled from a know origin to a known destination through the Postal Service in a specific date. Objects shall possibly have their stamps on it, in good conditions and according to a specific postage rate. The boundaries of my collection are, on one side, the Democratica series issued in 1945 (technically it’s not Italian Republic yet, but it was the ordinary series which was valid when Republic was voted in the 1946 referendum) and, on the other side, the silk envelope issued at the end of 2001, the last Italian postal object with a value in Italian Lire.\nHow did you organize your material?\nMy material, and therefore my site, is organised according to three specific classes:\n– postal objects: in this part of the site the material is organised according to the typology (letters, postcards, etc.) with possible additional services (express delivery, registration, etc.) during the different periods;\n– franking: in this part of the site there is the same material of the postal objects part, but this time sub-pages are organised according to the applied stamps;\n– themes: in this part of the site there is only a selection of the material, for which some specific studies were performed.\nJust to make an example: a basic fare letter franked with 25 lire stamp of Italy At Work series will be found either in the Postal Objects menu (sub-menu basic fare letter, sub-menu basic fare letter within Italy) or in the Franking Menu (sub-menu definitive series, sub-menu Italy At Work); among the themes the same object will appear a third time only in case there is a special aspect to put in evidence: a cancellation with a slogan plate, the postmark of a Travelling Post Office, a tax, a story to tell…\nIn the pages dedicated to postal objects or to stamps, sometimes there’s a link and sometimes there isn’t: why?\nMaybe I do not have any object which traveled with a certain stamp, or during a specific period. Maybe I already have the object, but I still haven’t had the time to scan it and to publish it in the site. I preferred to create the framework first and then, according to my availability (I’ve got a family and a job!), I will put in order what I already have and what I may purchase in the future.\nWhy did you erase the name of some recipients?\nI censored names and/or addresses in the postcards or in the envelopes that were given to me by friends and relatives. None of them, in fact, kindly gave me that material to see one day their own name and address published in a website. I did not have the same consideration for the material I bought: these objects were already publicly exhibited in catalogues, on ebay or in a shop.\nIs your material on sale?\nNo. I have an Ebay account and sometimes I sell some pieces, but the material I published here is not on sale.\nWhere did you find the objects in your collection?\nA part of the material comes from my own family archive: these are letters and postcards received by my parents, relatives and me through the years. Another part comes from friends and colleagues: they have been knowing for years about this passion of mine, they patiently deal with it and they kindly keep for me all the empty envelopes and the old postcards that would have been thrown away otherwise.\nOther material was bought in markets, websites, shops, auctions.\nWhen I started being interested in philately, a dear friend donated to me a lot of letters and postcards belonging to his collection and to his family archive: if one day I started to study and collect Postal History it’s mainly his fault. Now this friend is not with us any more, and this site is also dedicated to his memory. Thanks again, Leo!.\nWhere did you find the information you present in the pages?\nFor the post objects I have worked with the Catalogo Unificato di Storia Postale edizione 2011-2013 Terzo volume “Servizio Corrispondenze Repubblica Italiana”, whereas for the pages dedicated to stamps I have used the main Italian catalogues (Sassone, Unificato, CEI). When I present more detailed information I also put a specific note with the specialized bibliography I used. I also gathered in a specific page the overall bibliography.\nCan I make references to the material which is published in your site?\nYes. There are some basic rules, I explain them here. Since this site was created for the pleasure of sharing, without any intention of making money off of it, I limited my requests to those good manners rules that should be obvious for all the people sharing a common interest.", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

{"id": "372", "text": "Offering website maintenance in your web business is the best way to establish recurring revenue, provide quality support for your clients, and build relationships so you stay in business for years to come. Featuring a website maintenance sales page on your website is the best way to begin this conversation with clients, and having a strong sales page is a key ingredient in that equation.\nUnfortunately, most web businesses miss an opportunity with their sales pages — loading them up with way too much information, or don’t even list one at all!\nI don’t want that to happen to you.\nProspects are not just browsing for types of services, but also for signs of how well we work with and take care of our clients.\nWe forget that when prospects come to our website to reach out, they are often pouring over our pages to gauge what type of company we are. They are not just browsing for types of services, but also for signs of how well we work with and take care of our clients.\nYour website maintenance sales page is the best way to solidify that you take care of your clients and you’ll be around long after the web project is over.\nThe best website maintenance sales pages follow a simple formula to outline the offer and why it’s right for the client\nI’ve broken down this formula into five elements that you can follow to make sure your website maintenance sales page is positioning your company’s website maintenance plans in the best way possible:\n- State the problem.\n- Make the case that you offer the solution.\n- Outline the benefits or features.\n- Detail your plan options in a pricing table.\n- Feature real testimonials for social proof.\nLet’s go through each element.\n1. State the problem\nYou must assume that every lead or prospective client does not know the importance of keeping WordPress core and plugins up to date. As WordPress web professionals we know this, and have seen hacks because of outdated software time and time again.\nUnless you lay out the problem in your website maintenance sales page, your prospects will never know the value.\nI, personally, like pages with as few words as possible so I recommend presenting the problem in a blog post on your website then just highlighting the key points on the sales page. This way you can link to the blog post for those that want to dig further into the reasons why ongoing website support is important.\nDo this: Feature one or two sentences on the problem with a few bullets points for an easily scannable piece. Include a link to a blog post that digs deeper into the problem for those who want to read more.\n2. Make the case that you offer the solution\nAfter stating the problem, it’s time to outline that the support you offer is the solution to this problem. Emphasize what makes your company unique in offering this solution. This could include your experience, your speciality or your unique value proposition as a company.\nDo this: Include one to two sentences on the solution you offer.\n3. Outline the maintenance plan benefits or features\nNext, it’s time to break down the features of your website maintenance plans, but not in a pricing table … yet. Take this time to explore the benefits of what someone receives by signing up for ongoing website support, not just line items of what they “get.”\nFor example, your plan may offer a set amount of development time for support tasks, but the real benefit here for the client is the peace of mind they get sending an issue to a support ticket desk and knowing it will be taken care of.\nDo this: Explain the most important benefits or features that your maintenance plans offer. A grid format of three or six benefits works best.\n4. Detail plan options in pricing table\nNow that you’ve outlined the benefits, you can break down the plan options in a pricing table to showcase for your prospect the options they have for website support.\nIt’s common to lay out three plans varying in levels of support. The basic plan offering the bare bones support you supply clients, and the premium being the fully loaded version. Often clients fall right in the middle, so make that middle plan your sweet spot with what you believe most clients look for in ongoing website support.\nIf you are at a loss of what to include in your pricing table, I strongly recommend you look at ManageWP and the features that they offer. Using a tool like ManageWP to deliver website support will also help you define what features to offer for website support on top of your unique offerings.\nDo this: Create a pricing table with up to three plans with tiered pricing. Make sure the plans outline what’s not included in one and included in the other so prospects can easily tell what sets each tier apart.\nIf you're not sure about the best way to price things, this guide will help you decide which pricing model is best for your web design business.\n5. Include real testimonials for social proof\nFinally, feature testimonials from your clients about how having website support has benefitted their company or how they’ve enjoyed working with you.\nWebsite maintenance is all about trust.\nIf you’ve yet to work with a prospect on a website project, they won’t know that you take pride in your work, respond to emails and work to keep the website running well. Testimonials are a great way to begin the trust process with the prospect.\nIf you’ve yet to collect testimonials, the response you will get from sending a simple email to your clients might surprise you. More often than not, clients are happy to supply a testimonial as long as you give an example, specify the ideal length and a deadline by which you need it by.\nDo this: Include at least three testimonials from real clients about the benefit of a website maintenance plan or their experience working with you. Listing a testimonial with just a first name and last initial looks fake and works against you. Make sure to feature the company’s logo/avatar as well as their website link to add credibility.\nSome additional points to note…\nA few things to remember as you set off to construct your website maintenance sales page for the first time, or re-work what you already have:\nDon’t copy and paste content from other mass-market website maintenance sites or competitors. Make the words your own and put in your own voice. Inject what makes you unique into your copy and stand apart from the rest!\nDon’t feel pressured to put your pricing public — that isn’t the point here. You don’t need to specify your pricing if that is not part of your business model. Just letting your leads know these plans exist after a website is launched will start the conversation. After which, you can include pricing in your proposals.\nDon’t assume leads will sign up through your sales page. The website maintenance sales page is there for positioning; you will still need to sell these to your client throughout the proposal process or after a website is launched. You might need to work with clients on a project first before they agree to ongoing care, or create an initial evaluation and website cleanup plan to solidify trust. Just make sure to let them know after a website is launch or evaluated that they need to move onto a care plan for further support.\nDo offer a “cancel any time” policy. With the ability for the client to cancel their ongoing website support at anytime, you encourage more signups and the ability to prove you will deliver the goods. In my five years of offering ongoing website maintenance plans, I’ve never seen this abused in my own business.\nDo require a paid evaluation of a website you didn’t build before allowing them to sign up for a care plan. It’s not fair to you or the client to agree to support a website without fully looking under the hood and fixing issues that will poise a problem further down the road.\nReady? It’s time to build your website maintenance sales page!\nCreate your website maintenance sales page so you don’t miss out on any potential clients who are browsing your website to see if you are a good fit for their business.\nMost importantly, refine your offer with the tips listed above so you feel confident about the ongoing plans. A great website maintenance sales page will reflect that you are a business owner who is concerned about their clients’ websites and works to provide quality support on an ongoing basis.", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}
{"id": "373", "text": "Along with a billion Muslims across the globe, I turn to Mecca in Saudi Arabia every day to say my prayers. But when I visit the holy cities of Mecca and Medina, the resting place of the Prophet Muhammad, I am forced to leave overwhelmed with anguish at the power of extremism running amok in Islam’s birthplace. Non-Muslims are forbidden to enter this part of the kingdom, so there is no international scrutiny of the ideas and practices that affect the 13 million Muslims who visit each year.\nLast week, Saudi Arabia donated $100 million to the United Nations to fund a counter terrorism agency. This was a welcome contribution, but last year, Saudi Arabia rejected a rotating seat on the United Nations Security Council. This half-in, half-out posture of the Saudi kingdom is a reflection of its inner paralysis in dealing with Sunni Islamist radicalism: It wants to stop violence, but will not address the Salafism that helps justify it.\nLet’s be clear: Al Qaeda, the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, Boko Haram, the Shabab and others are all violent Sunni Salafi groupings. For five decades, Saudi Arabia has been the official sponsor of Sunni Salafism across the globe.\nMost Sunni Muslims around the world, approximately 90 percent of the Muslim population, are not Salafis. Salafism is seen as too rigid, too literalist, too detached from mainstream Islam. While Shiite and other denominations account for 10 percent of the total, Salafi adherents and other fundamentalists represent 3 percent of the world’s Muslims.\nUnlike a majority of Sunnis, Salafis are evangelicals who wish to convert Muslims and others to their “purer” form of Islam — unpolluted, as they see it, by modernity. In this effort, they have been lavishly supported by the Saudi government, which has appointed emissaries to its embassies in Muslim countries who proselytize for Salafism. The kingdom also grants compliant imams V.I.P. access for the annual hajj, and bankrolls ultraconservative Islamic organizations like the Muslim World League and World Assembly of Muslim Youth.\nAfter 9/11, under American pressure, much of this global financial support dried up, but the bastion of Salafism remains strong in the kingdom, enforcing the hard-line application of outdated Shariah punishments long abandoned by a majority of Muslims. Just since Aug. 4, 19 people have been beheaded in Saudi Arabia, nearly half for nonviolent crimes.\nWe are rightly outraged at the beheading of James Foley by Islamist militants, and by ISIS’ other atrocities, but we overlook the public executions by beheading permitted by Saudi Arabia. By licensing such barbarity, the kingdom normalizes and indirectly encourages such punishments elsewhere. When the country that does so is the birthplace of Islam, that message resonates.\nI lived in Saudi Arabia’s most liberal city, Jidda, in 2005. That year, in an effort to open closed Saudi Salafi minds, King Abdullah supported dialogue with people of other religions. In my mosque, the cleric used his Friday Prayer sermon to prohibit such dialogue on grounds that it put Islam on a par with “false religions.” It was a slippery slope to freedom, democracy and gender equality, he argued — corrupt practices of the infidel West.\nThis tension between the king and Salafi clerics is at the heart of Saudi Arabia’s inability to reform. The king is a modernizer, but he and his advisers do not wish to disturb the 270-year-old tribal pact between the House of Saud and the founder of Wahhabism (an austere form of Islam close to Salafism). That 1744 desert treaty must now be nullified.\nThe influence that clerics wield is unrivaled. Even Saudis’ Twitter heroes are religious figures: An extremist cleric like Muhammad al-Arifi, who was banned last year from the European Union for advocating wife-beating and hatred of Jews, commands a following of 9. 4 million. The kingdom is also patrolled by a religious police force that enforces the veil for women, prohibits young lovers from meeting and ensures that shops do not display “indecent” magazine covers. In the holy cities of Mecca and Medina, the religious police beat women with sticks if they stray into male-only areas, or if their dress is considered immodest by Salafi standards. “This is not an Islam that the Prophet Muhammad would recognize”.\nSalafi intolerance has led to the destruction of Islamic heritage in Mecca and Medina. If ISIS is detonating shrines, it learned to do so from the precedent set in 1925 by the House of Saud with the Wahhabi-inspired demolition of 1,400-year-old tombs in the Jannat Al Baqi cemetery in Medina. In the last two years, violent Salafis have carried out similar sectarian vandalism, blowing up shrines from Libya to Pakistan, from Mali to Iraq. Fighters from Hezbollah have even entered Syria to protect holy sites.\nTextbooks in Saudi Arabia’s schools and universities teach this brand of Islam. The University of Medina recruits students from around the world, trains them in the bigotry of Salafism and sends them to Muslim communities in places like the Balkans, Africa, Indonesia, Bangladesh and Egypt, where these Saudi-trained hard-liners work to eradicate the local, harmonious forms of Islam.\nWhat is religious extremism but this aim to apply Shariah as state law? This is exactly what ISIS (Islamic State) is attempting do with its caliphate. Unless we challenge this un-Islamic, impractical and flawed concept of trying to govern by a rigid interpretation of Shariah, no amount of work by a United Nations agency can unravel Islamist terrorism.\nSaudi Arabia created the monster that is Salafi terrorism. It cannot now outsource the slaying of this beast to the United Nations. It must address the theological and ideological roots of extremism at home, starting in Mecca and Medina. Reforming the home of Islam would be a giant step toward winning against extremism in this global battle of ideas.\nEd Husain is an adjunct senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations and a senior adviser to the Tony Blair Faith Foundation.–Assyrian International News Agency", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}

{"id": "382", "text": "Sweta Ranjan | June 8, 2015\nRanjan Dhawan, executive director of Bank of Baroda, was entrusted with the additional charge of the managing director and CEO of the public sector banking giant on February 27. Before joining BoB as executive director in November 2012, he was the chief general manager of Punjab National Bank. With its vast network, BoB is a crucial player for financial inclusion. Excerpts from an interview with Sweta Ranjan:\nUnder the PMJDY, millions of accounts have been opened but transaction remains an issue. So, what next?\nThe intention of Jan-Dhan Yojana was that the government would have accounts readily available for various benefits it is contemplating, for example, fuel subsidies of various kinds. So, the accounts are now ready and now this [transaction] has to be [initiated] by a lot of activities. We assume and hope that in times to come these activities will take place. I was recently in Chandigarh and I was told that in one or two areas and in one or two schemes money has already started flowing and accounts are now being credited with the amount. In one scheme Rs 30 crore is being credited per month. We find from our practical experience that people don’t withdraw this money because they feel amounts are as for two or three months and then withdraw a good amount. I think activity has started.\nIs this scheme a matter of compulsion, or do banks see a business interest in it?\nWe – at least public sector banks [PSBs] – have taken up this challenge in national interest. We do feel that every family in the country should have an account and we did it with will and enthusiasm. It is correct that these accounts are not remunerative as yet. Until and unless people have balance in their accounts, they will not be so. We have spent a lot of money in opening these accounts and we will spend a lot of money on the IT systems and other things for holding and maintaining these accounts. We hope that going forward these accounts will also become remunerative for the bank.\nDo you see business viability in working with the poor?\nI think it is an investment for the future. If we believe that this country will have 6.5 or 7 or 8 percent growth, it is going to pull millions and millions out of poverty and into the lower middle class. These people will require bank accounts which will have money in it. I do believe this has created a base for the PSBs to acquire good customers in the future. This future may occur two to three years later, or five to seven years later.\nWhat about mobile banking for financial inclusion, the way it has been done in some African countries?\nMobile banking is mainly successful for funds transfer in Kenya. They had a system called M-Pesa. There is an ecosystem which has been set up. For example, if a poor person wants to transfer money to his village, there are various kinds of shops. He would give his money to one shop, there would be mobile transfer of his money to the shop near his village and somebody from his family can come and collect this money.\nI believe that banking of the future is going to be mobile banking. Even today people prefer to do their internet shopping or internet travel [booking] through the mobile phone. Increasingly people do not access the internet on the PC. Funds transfer will occur – is also occurring – via internet through the mobile, also through a lot of apps. For example, Bank of Baroda has developed an app: Baroda m-connect. If I want to do banking, all I do is just use this app conveniently.\nThis is very convenient but will it suit the poor who are not tech-savvy?\nIt will suit them because it is very user-friendly. Secondly, the handset cost, even of smartphones, has come down drastically. The only handicap, to some extent, will be for illiterate people. I am sure that over a period of time, some solution will be worked out and we would have a process which will help the illiterate transfer their money. We can have self-explanatory icons. Secondly, not many people realise this but even the illiterate people are ‘numerate’, they can read numbers. This is the technology whose time has come.\nHow sustainable is the existing ATM infrastructure to handle the increased workload from new accounts?\nOur ATM infrastructure is getting upgraded rapidly. About two years back Bank of Baroda had 2,200 ATMs, today we have more than 7,000. I am now seriously looking at the possibility of adding 3,000 ATMs under a different model. I will not disclose what this model is. But, yes, the ATM infrastructure in the country is rapidly expanding and now penetrating even the rural areas.\nIt is not the case that an ATM would be viable in every rural area and for that we also have the business correspondent (BC) model, which is working. Any new technology, any new process takes time to stabilise. We must remember that even the BC model was floated about five years back, and it has taken four to five years to stabilise.\nThere is no magic wand: it has its teething problems, technological problems. For example, in rural areas, typically connectivity is very weak. It has taken time to solve the connectivity problem. One of the ways we have done so is through satellites. Satellite (connectivity) is available anywhere and everywhere, wherever you may be. It is expensive. So, there are problems of expenses, there are problems of technology absorption also, because if you make a transaction through some other route then you have to change and upgrade your technology over here. Because technology is hitting the data sever in Mumbai. How do we recover the transaction if the data link breaks? There are a lot of technological problems we face. We are working on them. What gives hope is the fact that over the last five years we have solved most of such problems.\nYour bank had opened 56 lakh accounts by mid-February. Did you face any staff shortage or infrastructure problems?\nOne problem that has occurred during opening accounts under the Jan-Dhan Yojana is that we have not carried out normal development work that we do. Our job is to serve customers. The normal banking development work, to some extent, took a back seat because the entire branch staff was concentrating on opening the Jan-Dhan accounts.\nSo, staff strength was an issue…\nNo. There have been no issues. The branch staff was almost exclusively deployed to open the Jan-Dhan Yojana accounts. So, some of the targets, for example in retail lending, have not been achieved – especially in loans.\nDoes your bank have any tailor-made schemes for Jan-Dhan customers?\nAs of now we don’t have any tailor-made scheme. Our focus has been on opening accounts. In time to come when we find out what the demand on the ground is, we will certainly have some schemes.\nSix months after opening an account a customer can avail overdraft facilities. Do banks have ample funds and infrastructure for it?\nCertainly, we have put up a very good structure on the ground. On the manpower front we have appointed a huge number of business correspondents who are doing a very good job. Our backend process is also now in line. We have a separate server for the Jan-Dhan accounts. So, the entire structure is in place, and we can handle this.\n(The interview appears in the June 1-15, 2015 issue)\nSnakes, Drugs and Rock ’N’ Roll: My Early Years By Romulus Whitaker with Janaki Lenin HarperCollins, 400 pages, Rs 699\nThe Moral Contagion By Julia Hauser and Sarnath Banerjee HarperCollins, 140 pages, Rs 699 The world has lar\nAddressing the Viksit Bharat Viksit Uttar Pradesh program in Lucknow on Monday, prime minister Narendra Modi launched 14,000 projects across the state, worth more than Rs 10 lakh crore at the fourth groundbreaking ceremony of UP Global Investors Summit held in February 2023.

The city’s fleet crew sheltered in place for three days to work on first responder units and brush trucks for recovery efforts. There was no fleet facility damage, and only minor window damage to some cars.\nReplenishing fuel for generators was the biggest concern. “We used our fuel trucks to do that, and also made sure we kept the fueling station for our first responders,” said Jim Davis, director of fleet maintenance.\nAbout 350 vehicles in the City of Houston fleet were impacted by the hurricane, with 280 considered a total loss. Many of these vehicles were used by first responders in the Police, Fire, and Public Works Departments, though some were parked in garages and lots in downtown Houston. One of the fleet’s 25 maintenance facilities was inundated with water and is considered a total loss. The rest experienced little to no damage.\nFleet’s primary role was maintaining fuel levels for emergency operations, and quickly servicing and repairing emergency response vehicles. Staff worked 24 hours a day during the storm to keep emergency responders moving and saving lives. Although debris cleanup is expected to continue for months, during which time fleet will continue maintaining Solid Waste equipment, most fleet operations are back to normal.\nThe City of Tampa fleet had minimal damage to its facility, with vehicle damage still being assessed. Fleet assigned two technicians and a mobile truck to each of the city’s emergency response centers.\nA 12-man crew stayed at the fleet maintenance facility before and during the hurricane for rapid support of tires, parts, and maintenance. Fleet staff also played a substantial role in emergency fuel planning and delivery, monitoring fuel at seven sites before and during the storm.\nBefore the storm, the Palm Beach County fleet ensured road clearing equipment, dump trucks, and other response equipment were ready to use and ensured over 100 emergency generators around the county were at maximum fuel level. After the storm, fleet continued refilling these generators until power was restored. Only one fleet vehicle has been identified with damage so far, and the fleet’s facilities sustained minor damage.\nMiami-Dade County’s fleet suffered power losses, some flooding, and one vehicle with notable damage from a downed tree. Alex Alfonso, fleet management division director for Miami-Dade County, said major challenges included maintaining power at facilities and maintaining communication at the fleet’s automated fuel sites. In some cases, fleet personnel manually dispensed fuel to county vehicles. Fuel was also difficult to source, due to refineries shutting down after Harvey and the limited availability of transport carriers before Irma.\nRead more about the fleet impact from Hurricane Irma here.", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}

They opened up with the theme from the movie Halloween evoking light laughter from the audience.

Like their first two albums the Bad Plus likes to cover unique songs.

{"id": "388", "text": "<p>Gustave Klimt (1862-1918) is widely regarded as one of the most talented artists of the 20th century. Born in Austria and one of the founders of the Vienna Secession, his unique and beguiling style spans from Byzantium art to Expressionist-inspired portraits.<p> <p>Klimt is best known for The Kiss (1907). It's a profoundly symbolic and highly sensual piece. Klimt augmented the oil canvas painting of converging lovers with metals, including platinum, silver, and gold leaf. The effect is an extraordinary piece that is impossible to forget.<p> <p class=\"title-4\">Gustav Klimt in Context</p> <p>To fully understand the timeless work of Gustav Klimt, we need to place him within his context. The Vienna of the late 19th century was a conservative and uptight place. Victorian-era social and moral attitudes, such as modesty, family values, and sexual oppression abounded.<p> <p>Klimt initially worked within this framework. However, his work was deeply symbolic and often explored erotic themes and the female body. His choice of theme and subject matter can be viewed as a rejection of the Viennese social mores of his time.<p> <p>While classical and naturalistic styles were popular in this period, Klimt went in the other direction. He sought to express dreams and sensuality, though his rebellion caused much consternation at the time. Indeed, his last public commission — the paintings Philosophy, Medicine and Jurisprudence — were savaged for their perceived lewdness.<p> <p class=\"title-4\">Characteristics of Gustav Klimt wall décor</p> <p>Seen through a modern-day prism, the work of Klimt does not appear overly sexual or crude. As he matured, he turned his gaze towards landscapes and, on occasion, society women draped in fur and adorned with gold leaf. For many, this era represents the peak years of his output.<p> <p>However, despite shifts in style, some constants remain. In particular, spirals, swirls, gold embellishments, and thinly disguised psychosexual imagery are all hallmarks of Klimt's inimitable style.<p> <p class=\"title-4\">What spaces suit Gustav Klimt wall art?</p> <p>While Klimt's approach was very forward-looking, his art is rooted in a particular time and space. Gustav Klimt wall décor can work in a variety of rooms. The style, especially his portraits, retain enough connection to early 20th-century realism that they work in almost any environment. However, his more Byzantium or Orientalist-inspired pieces can fight for space within the most opulent rooms.<p> <p>Explore our collection of Gustav Klimt wall décor when you need something eye-catching and hedonistic with a refined edge.<p>\n<p>Oil on canvas by Gustav Klimt, 1901.</p>\nBring high quality wall art into your home or office with a canvas print that will never warp or sag.

And what if every time you complained, fixed a bug just for you?\nThe Chinese hset maker, Xiaomi, has built an empire of 100 million users worldwide on this exact premise. “’re an Internet company,” said Bin n, esident of Xiaomi, at a press event on Thursday. “’re not just interested in making hsets.”\nile it’s true that Xiaomi has been particularly successful selling directly to customers rather than through other retailers or carriers, that’s not what n was referring to. He was boasting about the company’s massive user base overseas, which has grown rapidly thanks to savvy social media tactics. “They are not our customers, they are our fans,” added Hugo Barra, a former executive who left in 2012 to serve as Vice esident of Global Operations at Xiaomi.\nXiaomi has gone to great lengths to accommodate these “fans.” For instance, when the company launched its first ROM in 2010, there were only 100 users, but after it started making devices its marketshare grew, Xiaomi honored those that had stuck with them from the beginning by printing their name in the MIUI boot loader.\nThen there was the time a fan requested that Xiaomi make it easier to turn on the flashlight from the ck screen. He argued that his parents wouldn’t have caught him coming home drunk if he wouldn’t have made such a racket dropping his keys. A week later, the developers pushed out a software update that included that exact feature. “Everything we do is with social as a platform,” said Barra. “Every market we enter has its differences, but at the core everyone is social, everyone is emotional, everyone loves to be spoken to—to be marketed at.”\nXiaomi in the\nXiaomi’s entrance into the U.S. mobile market will incorporate some of the tactics that have made it famous overseas. though the company won’t initially sell phones tablets—Barra said “the amount of effort required to bring those products to market is significant”—it does plan to appeal to U.S. customers (sorry, fans) in a similar manner. Barra cited its recent success in India. “en we entered India, we didn’t know how things were going to turn out. India got it. They understood what we were coming to market with… were bringing more than anyone had ever brought.”\nUnlike India, the already has “more.” It has Apple, Samsung, HTC, , Microsoft, a whole array of manufacturers vying for marketshare. It also has carriers; most customers don’t buy smartphones tablets directly from the manufacturer when they can get the device subsidized from their cellular provider. There’s incentive there that Xiaomi will have to compete with, not to mention a pattern that users have become accustomed to ever since mobile phones became a necessity.\nThere’s also the question of how Xiaomi plans to market to the everyman—users that aren’t necessarily “in the know,” but who do a little research for their bi-annual phone upgrades. I asked Barra about this—about how he’d get someone like my Mom onboard the Xiaomi train— he bluntly answered, “You’ll buy her one.” Essentially, Xiaomi is banking on its existing “fans” to convert their friends family members, too.\nUnfortunately, we won’t get to see Xiaomi’s plan in action for some time, since it’s limited on what it can sell here in the U.S. But the company is very optimistic about its future stateside. “Building a fan base [in the U.S.] is no different than how we built a fan base in India,” said n. “Driving marketshare having a great experience…is really the most important goal for us.”", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

{"id": "392", "text": "In my working experience, autocross can be a really exciting and thrilling sport. I have participated in a number of occasions in my community location. I observed the passion to be quite addictive as well.\nOut of all my other hobbies, I believe this just one is the best “bang for the buck” as far as thrills go with your motor vehicle. Every person can take part. Each and every motor vehicle (some golf equipment have exceptions to this nevertheless like no SUV’s, no Trucks) can race. The awesome thing about this kind of race is that you are competing versus other folks in your course typically defined by the SCCA, having said that, you are on the training course by itself so there is negligible opportunity of hitting other cars. Just Divorce help families when there are disputes around wills and probate.\nThe hardest section about autocross (apart from understanding how to race) in my feeling is getting the suitable vehicle. Absolutely sure, you can use a each day driver, but that is not advised if you are going to take part in a number of activities a year. Autocross can build put on on the tires and other elements very speedily and can get highly-priced pretty rapidly. I would advise to get a motor vehicle that you can use for autocross. This can be a “trailer auto” or a car or truck that you can nonetheless generate on the road, but use only for this hobby.\nThere are 4 important parts to take into account when choosing a motor vehicle for autocross:\n1) What sort of motor vehicle to get\n2) The Price of the car or truck\n3) The overall affliction of the vehicle (if made use of)\n4) Aftermarket upgrades/modifications\nWHAT Form OF Automobile TO GET FOR AUTOCROSS:\nFor autocross racing, some individuals would suppose that the car has to be extremely impressive, compact, 2 doors and modified. This is not completely accurate. While that variety of motor vehicle would be pleasant, it is not demanded to be aggressive in autocross.\nBear in mind that most autocross gatherings and clubs have the automobiles grouped in to some sort of class. The club I participate with follow the SCCA Course suggestions. The classes aid group the vehicles so the same “stage” of autos can remain aggressive in each course.\nThis is done to steer clear of the “greatest and fastest is very best” point out of considered. It would be unfair to put a closely modified Porsche GT3 up versus a inventory Ford Concentration. This is why they do that.\nSo, to decide the ideal automobile for autocross, you would in all probability want a coupe or convertible 1st if attainable. Sedans can operate nicely way too, but some sedans are not geared for modifications, though, the activity sedans of nowadays are truly beginning to acquire about.\nHandbook transmission would be advisable, nevertheless, if you have an computerized that is Okay much too. You could want to look at trading it for a handbook in the foreseeable future to continue being competitive. Once more, there are even now “sport shift” sort automatics out there that are obtaining greater and greater each and every working day.\nPreferably, you would also want a rear-wheel drive motor vehicle for autocross. RWD autos commonly provide greater command and handling in most cases. I know some fans out there will disagree with me, but that’s Ok. On the other hand, I have employed many front-wheel generate autos that run with the best of them.\nThe cost of buying a automobile for autocross is generally the aspect for me. I, like a lot of other folks, cannot find the money for an costly car or truck for autocross. There are, even so, those that can pay for it and price tag is nevertheless something for them to consider.\nThe $-$5000 variety:\nThis is the assortment most of us newcomers want to commence. Of system, no cost is Good, but look at the 3rd element (all round problem) when this option comes to brain. Numerous automobiles that can conduct perfectly and have a great deal of upgradable possibilities are the next:\n1989-1997 Mazda Miata – Quite great electric power to bodyweight ratio. It is Incredibly well-known at autocross. 1979-1991 Mazda RX7 – Quick small car or truck, handles effectively. Several updates accessible. 1989-1998 Nissan 240sx – Many aftermarket updates, handles very effectively. 1990-1999 BMW 3 Sequence – Quite versatile car. You can find quite great models in this assortment now. 1988-2000 Honda Civic/CRX – I have viewed several types compete well in autocross. 1984-1999 Toyota MR2 – Minimal centre of gravity, great general performance, mid motor. 1990-1999 Mitsubishi Eclipse/Eagle Talon – Lots of updates, some models Turbo AWD. 2000-2007 Ford Emphasis – Really competitive automobiles. SVT styles obtainable in selling price variety. 1997-2003 VW Golfing – Hatchbacks often like autocross. VR6 styles out there in selection. 1990-1999 Acura Integra – Like the Civic, really aggressive with quite a few upgrades out there.\nThere could be a few much more cars that I skipped that fall less than this price selection. The system I use to hunt for cars can fluctuate depending on the form I am searching for. I will use nearby categorized ads, Craigslist. I will also use the bigger motor vehicle lookups and develop my general “looking” area. I have effectively located great vehicles using VEHIX, AutoTrader as effectively as Government Auction Web pages.\nBut what about the autocross vehicles above the $5000 vary? Very well, I am happy you are feel that for the reason that I am about to record them beneath.\nIf you have some money to work with and want to get something more recent, you can contemplate the subsequent autos:\nThe $5,001-$20,000 selection:\nThis assortment can involve more recent cars as effectively as pre-owned vehicles that are no much more than a couple of several years aged. Recall, cars and trucks typically depreciate very quickly, so as the a long time go by, some of the more recent cars can be in just access for fewer money and are wonderful for autocross. The cars and trucks underneath occur to mind in this vary:\n1998-Latest Mazda MX-5 – Continue to same basic vehicle, but much more energy as they obtained more recent. 2003-Present-day VW Golfing – Even more modified than the former versions, contend effectively. 1992-1997 Mazda RX7 – 3rd Gen is twin-turbo and can compete in autocross. 1992-2006 BMW M3 – M3’s are created for racing. Some more recent versions will drop in this assortment. 1998-2003 BMW M5 – M5’s are really highly effective and compete in their course properly. 1994-Present Ford Mustang/Cobra – Extremely adaptable automobile. Competes properly in class. 1994-2002 Camaro/Firebird – Competes perfectly in class. Many autocross updates. 2007-Present Mazda Mazdaspeed3 – Turbo, hatchback, competes properly in autocross. 2003-2008 Nissan 350z – Fantastic autocross motor vehicle, quite well-known on the keep track of. Specific Autocross Kit autos this kind of as the V6 Stalker fall in this array as well.\nNow, this cost selection can change in vehicles. A whole lot of these cars are nevertheless new and could have to have financial loans to buy them.\nThe $20,001 spectrum will consist of some of the current-working day versions as well as the noticeable “tremendous vehicles” we all respect this sort of as the Corvette, Viper, Porsche, Ferrari, Lotus and other folks. I will not incorporate a listing for these because if you are obtaining one particular of individuals for an autocross motor vehicle, you did your investigation.\nOver-all Issue OF THE Automobile (Used):\nWhen getting a 2nd vehicle for autocross, address it like when you are purchasing your each day driver automobile. You want the motor vehicle to be fairly free of significant issues. Autocross racing can set strain on the car’s body, the suspension, the brakes, the tire and the total physique of the motor vehicle.\nYou want to be sure that the motor vehicle has not been in any significant incidents. Body mend or body injury can be extremely harmful mixture when you autocross. That is the MOST crucial point to test for when buying a auto for autocross. I have skilled and made use of the service by Experian named AutoCheck. They offer you an unlimited amount of VIN checks for one particular of their service selections and the rate is way improved than the other products and services out there. I have utilized it when shopping and comes in extremely helpful when you are checking the heritage of a car.\nThe up coming crucial product to check on the automobile is major ingredient difficulties this sort of as smoke coming out of the back again of the exhaust, main oil leaks (small leaks are envisioned on most made use of cars) slight/major overheating of the engine. Autocross is exterior and you push the automobile to the limit. You want the important parts to be in the ideal shape they can be. The talked about troubles can leave you stranded at the keep track of if you do not search out for them.\nI ordinarily have some expectation to do slight repair or preventive repairs on my vehicles when I am purchasing to autocross them. As I said over, small oil/fluid leaks are “Alright” and can usually be set very easily. Little leaks explain to us that the auto is just made use of and could not be suffering from the leak as a final result. Significant/significant leaks tell us the vehicle may perhaps have been neglected by the previous operator and may perhaps have residual problems unseen at the instant. When wanting at a auto, commence it up, drive it close to with the A/C engaged (even if it would not function). When you are finished with the check push, leave it idling while you walk about the auto continuing to inspect it. If the vehicle has an overheating challenge, typically this is the time it will exhibit. This idea has helped me stay clear of several lovely autocross vehicles that experienced an overheating challenge.\nBelts and hoses are my most repeated “preventive” restore I do, even if they are not a difficulty. It is often best to know when an important part has been changed rather than to “guess” and rely on the preceding operator. H2o pumps, as well, fall in this category from time to time.\nOne detail folks often examine when purchasing a applied auto are the tires. Of course, this is significant for an autocross automobile, but not to see how “great” the tires are, but to see if the automobile requires an alignment. Autocross is about handling and you require to be guaranteed the car’s stock “handling” capacity is where it must be.\nWhy not stress about the tires? Well, tires must be one issue to contemplate shopping for for your autocross car to start out with, so the current tires should really be eradicated in any case. Tires are possibly the most bought don item an autocross member will buy. A lot of autocross racers will provide a set of tires for racing, just one for driving household (people who do not use a trailer) and some will even bring spares for the racing tires. This is so common that Tire Rack provides tires just for autocross. I have utilised them and they are the very best spot to get tires for this.\nAFTERMARKET MODIFICATIONS FOR AUTOCROSS:\nIf you at any time look into the aftermarket globe of the automobile market, you know that there are actually thousands of locations to appear and purchase. I will list a handful of places that most individuals do not assume to glimpse, but amazingly have items for the autocross supporters.\nVery first and foremost, autocross cars and trucks do NOT often need main upgrades to be competitive. A driver can use a inventory vehicle and compete versus fellow stock automobiles and continue being aggressive. As soon as you begin to modify or enhance intensely, you may perhaps commence to go into different classes and contend with other autos that are similarly modified. Hold that in thoughts when you want to adjust anything.\nCommonly, I say modify the effortless issues initial: Ingestion, exhaust and basic tune ups. Most autocross drivers do not go far from that. These should be the first issues you check out to update though you participate in autocross to get the most overall performance out of your car or truck.\nIf you make your mind up to go further more to be far more aggressive, my subsequent suggestion would be suspension and body roll modifications. You should remember, sure updates in this place might adjust your course. Be sure to verify your club or teams rules with these modifications.\nTypically, the speediest up grade to an autocross auto would be entrance and rear strut tower bars/braces. They are typically cheap to purchase and effortless to put in. They are also incredibly modular which means that when you purchase these, they will perform with other suspension elements in position (typically). This modification allows stiffen the car’s suspension and body and allows with cornering.\nThe following modification recommendation would then be the front and rear sway bars and backlinks. These sections also assist the physique roll when cornering and handling and can occasionally be modular to the suspension system as a complete.\nThe last suspension upgrade is ordinarily the most high priced: The struts (shocks/springs). This upgrade commonly performs effectively with the higher than objects, but ads a lot more stiffness, extra response to the managing and at times decreased the automobile in general for a lower centre of gravity.\nAs soon as you have modified the entire suspension, my future advice would be to upgrade the brakes (at least the pads). This will help your halting potential for these times in which a faucet of the brake is necessary throughout a lap. Be sure to continue to keep in brain that high functionality brake pads generally use significantly more rapidly than OEM.\n1 of the past issues I suggest to upgrade is the tires. Now, I am not saying that you ought to not First invest in new tires when you autocross, but I am declaring not to Update them to an autocross/race tire just nevertheless. Most autocross fanatics will tell you to get made use of to the stock/typical tires on your motor vehicle initially.\nAfter you get used to inventory variety tires, modifying them to a race tire or softer tire will in fact strengthen your lap periods (that is the idea anyway).\nOne previous notice. I endorse replacing the fluids in your car with as quite a few synthetics as you can. Synthetic fluids have increased heat resistance and can take the intensive moments you will be putting on the car or truck throughout the autocross laps.", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

{"id": "396", "text": "Henry Kaiser has earned his Pioneer label not only by championing experimental guitar for over three decades, but by exploring the fantastical underwater playground of Antarctica. His massive output spans genres and cultures while never sounding like anyone else. He has collaborated with a who’s who of the guitar world from roots players to experimentalists like himself. His ability to conceptualize and clearly express his musical ideas in words makes for a fascinating interview.\nEarly Henry with Dixie Dregs Andy West on whammy bar bass\nWhat kind of music were you playing when you started out on guitar?\nI started out doing several things at once:\na) Experimental music: I wanted everything to be an experiment and always new.\nb) Improvised music: 95% of what I have done and what I will do is always improvised – that’s where the life and spirit is for me in music, in improvisation.\nc) I wanted to play the psychedelic music I grew up with in the Bay Area in the late ’60’s.\nd) I wanted to figure out how to play my favorite sorts of world music on guitar: Malagasy, Japanese, Vietnamese, Hindustani, Chinese, Burmese, etc. I particularly wanted to play stuff on guitar that was not originally played on guitar. Roots music, not commercial music, from alien cultures. This was very appealing in the same way that science fiction novella about alien worlds were to the young me—another way to go way out there. It’s probably true that experimental music was another kind of science fiction for me, too—I don’t think that I can overstate the importance of that.\ne) Blues being among my favorite listening material, and also so easily accessible on guitar, I wanted try to find my own voice in that. Focused throughout the music of my particular blues heroes: Hubert Sumlin, Albert Collins, Robert Pete Williams, Skip James, Harvey Mandel, Fred McDowell, and Ry Cooder.\nf) I wanted to understand and play the music of especially favorite artists of mine: Beefheart, Mahavishnu, Rydal, Basho, Fahey, etc.\nToday I do exactly the same things that I started doing in the first day that I got my first guitar, a Telecaster, in 1972.\nI guess I am the three things that I wanted to be: An improvising guitarist, psychedelic guitarist (in the sense that what comes out of my guitar should be mind-expanding, and an experimental guitarist. Putting those three things together is what all the years spent with guitars has been about for me.\nWhat led you to create experimental and improvised music?\nI think it was the LP and radio listening I did before I played guitar. Also the many concerts I went to as a young teenager, non-commercial, underground, and listener-sponsored radio of the 1970’s, as well as the Bay Area music scenes. What floated to the top for me were the particular qualities of music that was improvised and experimental; no matter what the genre or idiom. It’s what was in the air all around me in my formative years.\nWhose music inspires you?\nConlon Nancarrow, Gyorgy Ligeti, Morton Feldman, Iannis Xenakis, Toru Takemitsu, and everyone I mention in this interview, especially those I have collaborated with.\nHow did you get better at your current style?\nAt this point it seems to be conceptual. I have never really chosen to practice at all. Technique that I desire came vary easily. Most any theoretical music info is out there and easily accessible. I really only play guitar in the studio, at a gig, and if I am repairing or optimizing individual instruments.\nI think the expanding LISTENING, seeking out new unheard recordings and types of music to listen to is really what helps me get better the most. New concepts and ideas are what I look for. The best and most productive ones are things that cannot be written about or put in music notation. Things that cannot be described in terms of melody/harmony/rhythm—that’s where music and style is for me. I do think reading a lot of what ones musical heroes, and even enemies have to say in print can be enlightening too. I guess I am always looking for new little enlightenments. I seem to get better in quantum enlightenments, not with gradual improvement.\nWhat are you trying convey with your music?\nNothing much that I am specifically aware of, I just try to get out of the way and let the music convey what it wants to convey. I like to be surprised and I assume that the audience wants to be surprised along with me. So, I might be attempting to provide that. And I like to have fun with the music, so probably trying to provide that for the audience and me too.\nWhat’s currently the most essential gear for you?\na) Clean hi-fi pickups: Alembic or Bartolini or Q-Tuner\nb) A clean hi-f amp with JBL speaker: Dumble, Two Rock, Fender, Glasswerks, Rivera, Divided by 13.\nc) Tech 21 Comptortion distortion pedal\nd) Ernie Ball volume pedal\ne) A hi-fi compressor: Old World Audio 1960 or Origin Effects Cali 76\nf) Two of these three: Eventide Eclipse, Eventide Pitch Track, TC Flashback\ng) Ancient Lexicon PCM-42 or PSP-42 plug-in emulation of the Lexicon.\nh) Colorsound Wah or Wilson Colorful Clone\ni) An option that is increasingly necessary is True Temperament frets\nGive me that stuff, and I can be my maximum self on electric. It does not really matter what individual guitar. For acoustic guitar, it does not matter much. I’m spoiled with a lot of great and favorite acoustics at home: Monteleone, Sobell, Beardsell, Turner, Howe-Orme, Bohmann, Moonstone, Bourgeois, etc. But anything with new strings will work for me.\nWhich do you enjoy more: recording or playing live and why?\nThey are pretty much the same for me. I feel the future audience when I play in the studio, and I somehow feel like I am playing to them. And with a live audience, I really aim to connect with them, even doing the weirdest stuff. Solo and ensemble improvising are also equally fun for me. But if I had to choose one, I would always go for interacting with other players in real time. A lot of my use of digital guitar processing has been based on finding ways to surprise myself when playing solo, so that I feel that I am interacting with something that is outside of myself. I never have felt like I am doing any sort of self-expression in music, actually. I feel more like I just try to get out of the way, so that some cosmic message or joke gets through from Planet Zongo, or wherever.\nHow have you built up an audience for your music?\nWhen I first started out in the mid-’70’s, improvising and experimental musicians could easily put own their own albums through fairly effective distribution channels, and actually make surprisingly good money—at least enough to go on putting out more albums. That seems to be way more difficult now, and I don’t see it getting easier in the near future. Fairly early on I was quite present in the mainstream music media (which covered experimental things much more back then). As I made more commercial rock and jazz recordings, that allowed me to build more of an audience. A lot of film and TV soundtrack work did not build an audience, but it did help pay for more self-released things, and allow me to record things on spec, and then sell them to independent labels. Nowadays I just don’t know. How does one build and audience for experimental stuff, when good quality audio is practically absent in the commercial distribution of music? I think that experimental stuff, so often concerned with sonic detail, timbre, and color, simply does not survive to recruit new listeners in the lo-fi MP3 format.\nWhat influences your music besides other musicians and music?\nDuring my entire musical career I have also worked in film production and in underwater scientific research. Those other areas have always heavily affected my science fair approach to guitar and music making. Since 2001, I have been a research diver in the US ANTARCTIC PROGRAM. I think I have spent two years of my life living in a tent on the frozen Ross Sea and diving beneath the ice daily there. That kind of experience really changes everything about one’s life. But there’s not really the space to go into that here.\nMy favorite filmmakers have always been as much an influence on the music that I play, as my musical heroes. Primary among those might be: Jordan Belson, Pat O’Neil, Akira Kurosawa, Preston Sturges, Masahiro Shinoda, and Michael Powell.\nWith whom would you like to collaborate and why?\nI have gotten to play or record with so many of my biggest heroes: Jerry Garcia, Derek Bailey, David Lindley, Evan Parker, Terry Riley, Cecil Taylor, Wadada Leo Smith, Richard Thompson, Sonny Sharrock, Michael McClure, Glenn Phillips, Raymond Kane, Michael Manring, Andy West, Bill Frisell, Barry Melton, David Torn, Jaojoby, Drumbo, John Stevens, Freddie Roulette, Nels Cline, The Mermen, to name just a few. Many of them have become good friends of mine and I look forward to new, future collaborations with them.\nI love doing soundtrack work, whether it is cheap TV, or the projects that I did with Werner Herzog. I always want to do more soundtracks. It is very appealing to get that kind of work done efficiently and effectively. It’s not the easiest work to come by nowadays, as things get more and more conservative in the film and TV worlds.\nI wish I could do more of the sort of world music collaborations that I have done in Madagascar, Norway, Korea, and Japan. But that’s not something the market really can support nowadays. I sure wish I could do a project in Burma. And more stuff with Korean musicians. David Lindley and I may go back to Madagascar in 2015 for a British TV documentary. I hope that happens.\nA project in Iran, would be really tempting. There’s a great label there that does lots of cross-cultural projects: Hermes Records.\nYour solo album EVERYTHING FOREVER is an 80-minute guitar solo, using your signature square wave modulated delay effect. What ever led you to doing an 80-minute solo track?\nIt had been bothering me for a while that my last electric solo guitar piece on CD, A Little Stroke Of Light, was only 70 minutes long; when a CD can hold 80 minutes. I thought that it might stop bothering me if I did do an 80-minute solo. One take, no overdubbing, live performance. What’s going on musically and conceptually here for me is: Terry Riley, plus Evan Parker, plus Malagasy Tromba trance music, plus Xenakis type attitude towards stochastically sprayed-out clouds of notes (though quite consonant, in this case), plus square wave modulation of delay times with a couple of 30 year old Lexicon digital delays, plus Persian music structural concepts of “gushes,” staying away from rock guitar language and gestures, as well as some structural ideas from the music of Robbie Basho that were also likely to have been inspired by Persian music. When I recorded the 70-minute solo the year before, it seemed like 10 minutes had passed, subjectively speaking. This 80-minute solo felt like a 3-hour solo, while I was playing. The two projects are quite different, and I am super happy with both of them. I guess you can listen to these as background music, or in the car on a long drive. But I think they do hold up to close attention also, if a listener can maintain that kind of attention for 80 minutes. I used my parts Strat with a True Temperament neck, which produces nearly just intonation; in combination with the just 5ths and 4ths from the square wave modulation of the delays’ clock rates, I can almost reach some of the areas of just intonation electronic solo performance that I loved so much on Terry Riley’s just-intoned organ works like “Shri Camel” and “Persian Surgery Dervishes.”\nWhat are your latest projects?\nI’ve always been fairly prolific; I think I have been on about 250 or so albums at this point, since I was first on Eugene Chadbourne’s Guitar Trios album, back in 1976. For the most of the past three years, I had a mom painfully dying in hospice. The nearly full-time job of dealing with that slowed recording down quite a bit during that period for me—probably only three or four albums a year. I hope I am not overreacting too much with over productivity, now that I am back to working full-time again, but there are a myriad of projects suddenly happening for me.\nI recorded with the great Afro-American trumpet-player and composer Wadada Leo Smith. Wadada and I made three double-CDs 10 or 12 years ago with our Yo Miles! project, which explored the electric music of Miles Davis in his most experimental period, from 1972 through 1975. This new recording was a kind of return for us to those textures and sounds. Wadada came up with some wonderful compositions for a one-off band, with Bill Laswell on bass, Pheeroan Aklaff on drums, and three guitarists: me, Michael Gregory, Brandon Ross. We probably won’t see this issued for a while as the Tum label has two or three other Wadada recordings lined up for release first. It was a great session though, and we really got all three guitars to work well, playing together at the same time. Those two guys are super-terrific players and it was a great pleasure to be in the studio with them.\nIn a few weeks I’ll be in the studio with the amazing Ray Russell and a big band with two drummers, two basses, and four sax players. We are going to return to the musical areas of Ray’s more experimental stuff from the early ’70’s. Ray is someone who is totally amazing in many different senses for the wide range of things that he has done.\nWorking on a couple of new solo guitar albums: The Deep Unreal, another 80 minute trance guitar solo, similar to my Everything Forever , and a solo album using a lot of different 12-string guitars, both acoustic and electric.\nWeasel Walter, Damon Smith and I have another Plane Crash Trio album in the pipeline.\nLooping brothers Bill and Rick Walker are talking about a trio album with the three of us.\nA few months ago I made three albums in Houston in one day: an acoustic duet with the great guitarist Sandy Ewen, a duet with my old pal and bassist Damon Smith, as well as a quartet of the three of us along with Houston guitarist Ryan Edwards.\nA project with Peter Brotzmann and I with a Danish band called Elektro seems to be up for recording in Denmark in July.\nJonas Hellborg and I have been starting to plan a quartet band recording.\nTrey Gunn, and Morgan Agren and I are talking about expanding our Invisible Rays trio to a quartet, with the addition of Matte Henderson and recording in Sweden sometime in the not too distant future.\nThis stuff should keep me fairly busy for the next 12 months.", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

{"id": "399", "text": "Introduction to Plastering Tools\nPlastering is a skilled trade that requires precision, attention to detail, and the right tools to achieve a high-quality finish.\nWith a wide variety of tools available for different plastering tasks, it’s essential to know which ones are best suited for your specific project.\nThis ultimate guide to plastering tools will help you understand the purpose and usage of each tool, ensuring that you’re well-equipped for a successful plastering job.\nChapter One – Plastering Trowels\nOne of the most essential tools in any plasterer’s toolkit is the trowel.\nTrowels come in various types, including finishing trowels, skimming trowels, and more, each designed for a specific purpose in the plastering process.\n- Finishing trowels: These trowels are used for smoothing and finishing the plaster surface, providing a professional and polished look. They typically have a flat, rectangular blade made of stainless steel or carbon steel and a comfortable handle for easy use.\n- Skimming trowels: Skimming trowels are designed for applying a thin layer of finishing plaster on top of a base coat, creating a smooth surface. They often feature a pre-worn blade to help achieve an even finish.\n- Bucket trowels: This small, flat trowel is useful for getting plaster and compound out of the bucket and onto the hawk or mortar stand.\nWhen selecting a trowel, consider factors such as blade size and shape, handle type, and material.\nA larger blade can cover more surface area, making the job faster, while a smaller blade offers greater control for detailed work.\nAdditionally, choose a trowel with an ergonomic handle for comfortable use during extended periods.\nProper trowel maintenance is crucial for ensuring longevity and optimal performance.\nClean your trowel after each use, removing any leftover plaster to prevent buildup.\nOccasionally check for signs of wear and replace the trowel if necessary.\nChapter Two – Hawk and Float\nThe hawk and float are essential tools for holding and applying plaster during the plastering process.\nA hawk is a flat, square platform with a central handle underneath, used to hold plaster while you work.\nA float, on the other hand, is a smaller trowel-like tool used in conjunction with the hawk to apply and smooth plaster.\nWhen choosing a hawk, look for one made of durable materials like aluminium or magnesium, with a comfortable handle that provides a secure grip.\nThe size of the hawk should match your hand size and the amount of plaster you’ll typically be working with.\nTo use a hawk and float effectively, practice scooping plaster onto the hawk with the float, then applying the plaster to the wall with smooth, controlled motions.\nChapter Three – Mixing Tools\nProperly mixing plaster is crucial for achieving a smooth, even finish.\nThere are several tools available for mixing plaster, including mixing drills and paddle attachments.\n- Mixing drills: These are power tools designed for mixing various materials, including plaster. When selecting a mixing drill, consider factors such as power, speed settings, and overall durability. A higher wattage drill will provide more power for mixing thicker materials, while variable speed settings allow for greater control during the mixing process.\n- Paddle attachments: Paddle attachments, also known as mixing paddles, are used in conjunction with a mixing drill. These attachments come in various shapes and sizes, each designed for specific mixing tasks. A helical or spiral-shaped paddle is ideal for mixing plaster, as it promotes a smooth and consistent mix.\nTo properly mix plaster, add the dry plaster to a clean mixing bucket, then gradually add water while operating the mixing drill with a paddle attachment.\nBe sure to mix the plaster thoroughly, eliminating any lumps or inconsistencies, and achieve the desired consistency based on the manufacturer’s recommendations.\nChapter Four – Straight Edges and Feather Edges\nAchieving a flat, even surface is essential for professional plastering results. Straight edges and feather edges are tools designed to help plasterers accomplish this goal.\n- Straight edges: These are long, straight metal or aluminium tools used to check and correct the flatness of a plastered surface. To use a straight edge, place it against the surface and look for any gaps or high spots, then adjust the plaster as needed.\n- Feather edges: Feather edges are similar to straight edges, but they have a thinner profile and are typically more flexible. This flexibility allows for easier use on curved surfaces or in tight spaces.\nWhen using these tools, work methodically across the surface, checking and correcting the flatness as you go.\nThis process helps ensure a smooth, even finish that will look professional and stand the test of time.\nChapter Five – Corner Plastering Tools\nAchieving clean, sharp corners is an essential part of plastering, and specialised corner tools can help you accomplish this with ease.\nSome of the most common corner tools include:\n- Angle trowels: These trowels feature a blade with a 90-degree angle, designed for finishing internal corners. The angled blade allows for smooth application and shaping of plaster in tight spaces, ensuring a clean, professional finish.\n- Corner floats: Corner floats, sometimes called corner sponges, are used to smooth and shape external corners after plastering. These tools consist of a sponge or foam material with a 90-degree angle, allowing you to work the plaster into a clean, sharp edge.\nWhen working with corners, be sure to use the appropriate tool for the specific task, and take the time to ensure a precise, professional finish.\nChapter Six – Plastering Stilts and Hop Ups\nFor larger plastering projects or working on ceilings, plasterers often require additional height to reach their work area comfortably.\nPlastering stilts and hop ups can provide the necessary elevation, allowing you to work more efficiently and safely.\n- Plastering stilts: These adjustable stilts strap to your legs and feet, allowing you to walk and work at an elevated height. Stilts offer flexibility and mobility while working on high surfaces, but they require practice and skill to use safely.\n- Hop ups or ladders: Alternatively, you can use a sturdy hop up or a ladder to reach higher areas. While these options provide a stable platform for working, they may not offer the same level of mobility as stilts.\nWhichever option you choose, always prioritise safety when working at height, using appropriate fall protection measures and ensuring that your equipment is in good condition.\nChapter Seven – Cleaning and Maintenance Tools\nProper cleaning and maintenance of your plastering tools are essential for extending their lifespan and ensuring optimal performance.\nSome essential cleaning tools include:\n- Plasterer’s brush: A soft-bristle brush is perfect for cleaning your trowels and other tools after use. The soft bristles help remove plaster without damaging the tools.\n- Cleaning water and sponge: Keep a bucket of clean water and a sponge nearby while working to wipe down your tools as needed. Regular cleaning prevents plaster buildup, which can affect the performance of your tools.\nAfter each plastering job, clean your tools thoroughly, removing all traces of plaster, and store them in a dry, protected location.\nBy understanding the purpose and usage of each plastering tool, you’ll be well-equipped to tackle any plastering project with confidence.\nWith the right tools and techniques, you can achieve a professional, high-quality finish that will stand the test of time.\nThis exploration of plastering tools has offered an in-depth view of the essential instruments used in the plastering trade, from the basic hand tools to specialised equipment.\nThe discussion began with the ubiquitous plastering trowel, the plasterer’s primary tool. Used for applying, spreading, and smoothing plaster, the trowel is a versatile instrument available in different shapes and sizes to accommodate various tasks and preferences.\nNext, the focus shifted to the hawk and float. The hawk, a flat platform for holding plaster, and the float, used for smoothing and levelling the plaster, form a crucial partnership in the plastering process.\nThe importance of proper mixing was underscored in the section about mixing tools, which are essential for creating a smooth, workable plaster mix. Mechanical mixers and sturdy buckets, as well as mixing paddles for drill attachments, were identified as key tools for this stage.\nThen, attention turned to straight edges and feather edges. These tools ensure a flat and level finish to the plaster, vital for achieving a professional-looking result.\nCorner tools were introduced next. These specialised tools help create clean, sharp corners and edges, enhancing the finish and durability of the plasterwork.\nThe guide also ventured into the realm of plastering stilts and hop ups, essential for reaching high areas. While these may not be necessary for every project, they can increase efficiency and comfort for extensive or high-reaching plastering work.\nFinally, the importance of tool maintenance was emphasised with a discussion on cleaning tools. Keeping tools clean and in good working order not only extends their lifespan but also ensures the best possible finish to plasterwork.\nIn sum, a well-equipped plasterer’s toolkit should feature a range of trowels, a hawk and float, mixing tools, straight and feather edges, corner tools, and potentially stilts or hop ups.\nAdditionally, proper cleaning and maintenance tools are critical for ensuring the longevity and effectiveness of this equipment. Understanding these tools, their use, and care is vital for anyone engaged in plastering, whether as a DIY enthusiast or a professional.", "scores": {"score": 3, "score_transform_1": 5, "score_transform_2": 5, "score_transform_3": 0}}
{"id": "400", "text": "Partisan wrangling likely to block January 6 commission in Congress\nGet insights on the latest news in US politics from Jon Lieber, head of Eurasia Group's coverage of political and policy developments in Washington:\nWhat is the status of the proposed January 6 commission to investigate the Capitol assault?\nThe January 6 commission was an idea originally from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who proposed a commission modeled after the very successful 9/11 commission, which looked at intelligence failures leading up to the terrorist attacks on the Twin Towers in Manhattan on September 11th, 2001. Pelosi wanted to form a bipartisan commission to look at the Capitol insurrection on January 6th. Why it happened, how it happened, what the security failures were that led to it happening, who's responsible, and how to prevent it from ever happening again? And initially, Republicans were fairly cold to this idea because Pelosi had proposed a commission that was stacked in favor of the Democrats, with more democratic members than Republicans. House Republican minority leader, Kevin McCarthy, empowered representative John Katko from New York to go ahead and negotiate the commission. And eventually he came up with a compromised proposal that would have been evenly balanced between Republicans and Democrats, had subpoena power, and been able to produce a report by the end of the year.\nRepublicans, however, decided in the meantime that this commission was not good news for them. They began to be concerned that the Democrats would use this as a partisan opportunity to link them to the insurgence that took over the Capitol building, who were largely both in favor of Donald Trump, and also inspired by him to go and charge the Capitol. And the Republicans just don't want to be talking about this anymore. They want to move on and talk about Biden's policy agenda, where they think they're on much more stable political ground.\nMcCarthy now opposes the commission, which passed the House this week with about 35 Republican members voting for it, members who thought they were operating in good faith and typically want to be part of the problem solvers group in the House of Representatives. But it's unlikely to go anywhere in the Senate because minority leader McConnell opposes the commission, and probably represents the views of enough Republicans to successfully filibuster this thing.\nSo this isn't going to go anywhere. There may be congressional investigations into what happened on January 6th, but those investigations in the grand tradition of the hearings into Benghazi, and other purely partisan issues are going to be led by Democrats with Republicans. Maybe they participate, maybe they don't, but this is turning into a very partisan issue, as many other issues are in the US today.", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}

You cannot turn up without a ticket, and tickets are not for sale on site.\nTickets go on sale well in advance, but despite the site having capacity for up to 6,000 people a day, they tend to sell out far in advance, so you will want to plan as far ahead as possible.\nThe summer months, weekends, and school holidays are the busiest days of the year for the Studio so we recommend that you book as far in advance as you can if you are visiting over those periods.\nWeekdays often have better availability, so if you are flexible, look at different days of the week to maximise your chances of getting a ticket.\nTickets are for timed entry, which helps the studios manage visitor numbers throughout the day. Whilst there is no limit to how long you can stay after you enter, you do need to enter the attraction at the time you book. There is a little bit of flexibility in this, but its best not to show up hours later than your time to avoid disappointment.\nThe WB Studios Tour folks recommend you arrive at the site at least 20 minutes before your ticket time so you can go through the security checks.\nIf you cant buy a ticket from the official site, dont worry, you still have lots of options.\nDeluxe Tours can be booked directly with the Studios, subject to availability, on the official site here.\nRead Also: What Is Dobby In Harry Potter\nWarner Bros Studio Tour London Harry Potter Tour\nGo behind the scenes and learn about the making of the Harry Potter films\n- Confirmación inmediata\nThis Warner Bros.

{"id": "408", "text": "This property was perfect for our family of 4. Our boys loved playing on the beach and riding the waves all day with the provided boogie boards. The view is unmatched and the large doors opening up to the lanai was perfect for listening to the waves. The beach was never crowded and the waves were great for letting our kids play. We absolutely loved this property and will definitely be back! We watched the beautiful Maui sunset every night from the quiet and peaceful lanai. Thank you for sharing this beautiful property with us.\nIt was our first trip to Hawaii and naturally we wanted all to be perfect. Thanks to this amazing condo and location it was! Our family of four was overwhelmed by the view. The ocean and mountains were spectacular. The beach was private and quiet ... with perfect sand for our morning and evening strolls along the Pacific.\nThe snorkeling and turtle viewing was the real deal as we saw turtles each and every time we snorkeled. The condo is supplied with all the amenities a family would desire ... beach chairs, umbrellas, boogie boards, etc. Also no need to sweat the small stuff as the owners Mark & Cory along with Maria the property manager have all your needs covered (laundry detergent, bathroom necessities, cleaning supplies, paper towel, napkins, fully stocked kitchen, etc.). We were also surprised by the welcoming gift basket we found when we checked in! This unit deserves the Five star rating it perpetually receives!!\nThank you Mark, Cory, and Maria for the family vacation of a lifetime.\nThe Schmit family (June, 2023)\nThis was by far the best VRBO we stayed at in all of our years traveling to Hawaii. It is steps from a very soft sandy beach. The location is very quiet away from the crowds. The kitchen is very well furnished with all the kitchen utensils you need. The view out to the ocean from the lanai is outstanding. We had several dinners out on the lanai. Highly highly recommended!\nMy family and I had an excellent time at Makena Surf! The location is unbeatable: with the best view!! (think: perfect morning coffees on the lanai, beautiful sunsets every night, hearing the ocean waves from our beds); easy access to the great beach (which was not crowded, has perfect waves for kids to play/boogie board and great snorkeling); and close to stores/shopping if desired. The unit is exactly as presented, and it the best stocked kitchen we have ever had, which was a real treat! We actually cancelled our one dinner reservation because you couldn't beat watching the sunset on our own lanai! The complex also has two great big pools that my kids really enjoyed swimming in. The owner and property manager were both fantastic. This is our new favourite spot on Maui, and I hope to be back soon. Highly recommend!\nWe thoroughly enjoyed our stay at this beautiful Maui condo! Everything was perfect and exactly as advertised! The sunsets were out of this world and the patio was a perfect place to enjoy them! So much so, that we rarely left for dinner! Our kids really enjoyed the beach - the snorkeling was amazing and the surf was perfect for boogie boarding. So rare to find both on the same beach! The condo had everything we expected, and more! Our stay was incredibly relaxing and we are already looking forward to our next visit! Mahalo to Maria and the fabulous owners of B-303!\nWonderful property, everything with ideal. Excellent communications\nCondo was exactly as presented. You can not go wrong staying here.\nWe had a great time in Makena Surf B-303! Is was very clean, beautiful, comfortable…just amazing. We ate out on the lanai everyday, enjoying the beautiful view. The house was fully stocked with everything we could possibly need…from beach things to laundry soap and even special Maui snacks. We hope to stay again very soon.\nProperty is amazing! View is breathtaking.\nThank you Mark and Cory for sharing this special place! Our Family had a wonderful time and plan on coming back as soon as possible!\nThank you Maria for a seamless check in and welcome basket!\nThe property was amazing. The photos of the unit, while very accurate, don't do it justice. Mark & Cory (host) have a great place and were exceptional in timely responses to any questions. Maria (property/VRBO manager) was great too.\nThe unit had EVERYTHING we needed and then some (e.g., nice touch having the phone chargers on the nightstands in the master bedroom).\nThe sunsets from the back porch of the unit and beach were fantastic. My family took photos on a grassy section of the Makena Surf property (about a 2-3 min walk from the unit) and it was easily one of the prettiest views I'd ever seen.\nWe are a family of 4 with two teens. We love having a resort location/vibe AND having the space to move around in a unit. If you are looking for something in the SW section Maui in the Makena/Wailea area, I'd highly recommend this unit. We easily had a 5-star experience. We visited one of the nearby exclusive resorts with a resort pass and my wife and I looked at each other and said we clearly made the right decision staying where we did.\nMahola to Mark, Cory & Maria.\nOur stay at Makena Surf B303 on Maui was amazing. It exceeded all expectations. Mark and Corey's home was cozy, comfortable and beautifully decorated. It made a perfect location to go out and explore the island. And it was the perfect location to just \"be at home on the lanai\" - whale watch, listen to the surf, watch the sunset and sip champagne. The property manager, Maria, checked in both on arrival and departure and was available should any assistance be needed. Thank you Mark and Corey for sharing your home with us - it truly was a week spent in paradise. Warmest Mahalo! Amy and Burt\nWe enjoyed our stay tremendously. The property owner and condo manager were friendly and responsive. We highly recommend this place.\nThe unit was wonderfully accessorized and immaculate. It is a prime location with outstanding beach access and views. Enjoyed watching the whales, swimmers, and walkers. Owners and property manager are very responsive.\nA glorious property. Fantastic location and outstanding view from the spacious lanai. Well appointed kitchen. Mark and Maria checked in to ensure all was well with our stay. Magical Christmas in Maui our family of four will always remember. Highly recommend Makena Surf and hope to be back someday!!!\nGreat location, immaculate grounds, large beachfront patio, and responsive owner and staff.\nWe have stayed at the Makena Surf many times but B-303 is the most well-stocked and most welcoming condo we’ve ever stayed in. From the very helpful, friendly and professional manager to the array of kitchen and beach items available, this condo is a “dream come true”. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Makena Surf.\nEverything about this property was great. It was perfect for my husband and I alone but see that is would be a wonderful place for families as well. We will definitely be back.\nI am a hotel girl…but after staying at this property, I don’t know how I can go back to a hotel! The communication with Mark the owner was fantastic even before we arrived. When we arrived, Maria the manager made herself available to us the entire time. Ok, now with that out of the way, the condo had the most spectacular view with the most wonderful lanai. We cooked our BBQ dinners overlooking the incredible Maui sunset every night. The condo had every single thing we could have needed. We cannot wait to return. Thank you, Mark, Cory and Maria!\nFor those looking to enjoy a quiet Maui beach with sunset views, look no further. Makena Surf is a serene complex on a lovely sandy beach. If you like snorkeling, Turtle Town is about a 100 yard swim from this beach; tons of turtles and fish, pretty coral. The beach is fairly uncrowded, especially Monday through Thursday. A few hundred yards down the beach is a state park where you see folks getting married on the beach literally every night (presumably because a photographer told them this beach was quiet and perfect at sunset).\nAny condo in this complex would be good, but B303 seems really perfect. It’s been recently redecorated in a modern, tasteful vibe. Listening to the surf crashing on the waves for morning coffee never gets old. There are thoughtful touches in this condo ... plenty of spices, beach chairs and umbrellas, and a box filled with anything you might possibly need on the beach.\nLastly, the owners and house manager Maria are super responsive and helpful. Maria had great recommendations on take out food options. In short, all the 5 star reviews are well-earned. We are already contemplating when we return.", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

{"id": "410", "text": "Fashion presenter and Instagram star Naomi Isted never knew when her IBS symptoms would cripple her with bloating and cramps – here’s how she finally got it under control\nNaomi Isted has nearly 80,000 Instagram followers and a staggering 225,000 on Twitter. Though the 38 year old mother of two is based in London, she often travels the world covering fashion and lifestyle trends for the likes of Good Morning Britain and the E! News network. But behind the successful, super-glamourous image, the TV presenter and celebrity stylist has suffered with chronic, debilitating Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) since she was 16 years old, never quite knowing when the bloating, severe cramps and stomach pains would strike next.\nIBS is a vicious cycle that few understand unless they have the condition, says Isted, who is now 38 and lives in Essex with her husband and two children. For her, this cycle was dramatically compounded by her busy, frenetic work lifestyle. ‘I remember in my 20s travelling around the world filming a wine programme and literally always being in pain. It would debilitate me and then make me feel so tired and worn out, and that would have a knock-on effect on my work, my sleep and my mood the next day. Then, I would get more and more anxious about it, thinking: ‘Am I going to be able to find the right places to eat, where will I find healthy food while we’re on tour?’ and the resulting anxiety would make the IBS worse’.\nThe agony of IBS\nIsted was covering London Fashion Week last month and the impact on her IBS couldn’t be denied. ‘It’s fine when I am at home because by now I know the things that set me off – processed carbs such as gluten containing breads, even rice as well as milk and cheese. But when I am waking up at 5am to cover the shows, I know I need to eat right but where am I going to get my hands on some salmon and vegetables (which I know won’t bloat me) in the middle of LFW? Will there be things for me to eat? As a result, I’d end up panicking which would make the whole thing worse because there is such a link between IBS and anxiety. Sometimes would simply avoid eating altogether until it was really late and I was at home because I didn’t want to be sitting on the front row in agony the next day.’\nIBS is thought to affect up to one in five people at some point in their life, according to the NHS. It usually first develops when a person is between 20 and 30 years of age with around twice as many women are affected as men. The condition is often lifelong, although it may improve over several years. Unfortunately, many doctors are confounded by it, often issuing medications that treat only the symptoms, which usually include like Naomi’s, extreme abdominal cramps and bloating, as well as diarrhoea and constipation.\nThe medications that stopped working\nDiagnosed by her doctor at 16, Naomi’s IBS manifested primarily as extreme cramps and bloating and resulted in her being prescribed various medications over the years. ‘All my medications have been medical derivatives of mint that would help settle my stomach. But nothing worked for long,’ she says. ‘I think my body always became immune to every medication I was put on so eventually, nothing was terribly effective.’\nI am a size 8 but if I am bloated my waist size can increase by two inches\nUntil recently, IBS posed such an occupational hazard for Isted that she was often sent clothes by designers that she would have otherwise fitted into perfectly, if not for her boated stomach which Isted estimates could make her waist girth expand by a staggering two inches. ‘I am a size eight and designers would send me outfits to wear to specific events such as LFW,’ she says. ‘ But while my whole body is slim, if I am bloated I won’t be able to get into it because I will look like I am three months pregnant. I can’t tell you what that does for your self-confidence when you are surrounded by models that are towering over you and all size zero.’\nHaving always stuck to her various medications, and finding nothing really worked anymore, Isted began to research other IBS remedies online. About a month before this year’s London Fashion Week, she discovered Alflorex, a probiotic that is specifically formulated for those suffering with IBS. ‘I had never really considered the idea that IBS could be related to the bacteria in your gut, but I was prepared to give anything a go. I liked the fact that it was a simple one-a-day pill and also that it seemed to come with good medical research,’ Isted remembers.\nProbiotics are supplements that help replenish healthy bacteria in the gut which can be diminished by a stressful lifestyle, high sugar diet or taking antibiotics. A dearth of good bacteria in the digestive system have been shown to lead to problems as wide-ranging as eczema, depression and obesity and they are well-proven as a leading cause of bloating and IBS. The specific probiotic Isted tried was Alflorex, which contains a specific strain (35624) of bacteria shown in clinical trials as effective against the symptoms of IBS such as bloating, tummy pain and alternating bouts of diarrhoea and constipation in as little as four weeks. It was developed by scientists at the University of Cork and is recommended widely by gastroenterologists.\nThe probiotic supplement that helped\n‘I was ready to try anything and thought that in order to give it the best chance of working, I would stop my medication and see what happened,’ says Isted. Though Alflorex is supposed to take up to four weeks to work, for Isted the difference became noticeable more quickly. ‘Within about three days I noticed I wasn’t getting the stomach cramps I used to get and I was thinking, ‘Oh, it’s probably in my head,’ but about ten days later I noticed my stomach wasn’t getting bloated.’ Then, even her husband noted the difference. ‘In the evening my belly could get really bloated ordinarily, so I would use all the tricks; wear clothes that were loose around my stomach, cover up and so on. But at home I was always really relaxed so I guess it showed more. Just over a week after I started taking the Alflorex, my husband said ‘Wow! Your stomach’s looking really flat!’ which was nice.’\nbeing able to carry on through your day and not feel cramping, tummy pain or bloating, feels nothing short of a miracle\nConsequently, this year’s London Fashion Week was a different experience for Isted from years gone by. ‘I was able to fit into all the clothes I was sent,’ she remembers. ‘But it wasn’t just about fitting into clothes, it’s also what having a flat stomach has done for my confidence. I know it sounds stupid but after you have had two children and having spent what feels like a lifetime waking up feeling bloated, to suddenly be waking up with a flat stomach and being able to carry on through your day and not feel cramping or more tummy pain or bloating, feels nothing short of a miracle.’\nNow, though Isted’s busy lifestyle hasn’t changed, the panic and anxiety and terrible symptoms IBS used to cause her has. ‘Of course, I still take care with what I am eating – avoiding gluten and dairy and processed carbs where I can – but now during times when I am always travelling and having to eat with film crews whatever is available or if it’s half term and I am out with the children and there’s no healthy food in a play area I can get, I don’t have to panic because I can have a little not-so-healthy food and my stomach won’t react the way it used to. That’s meant the anxiety about my IBS has lessened and as a result, I have had a reprieve from that horrible vicious cycle of bloat-panic-can’t-find-healthy-food-panic-eat-whatever-I-can-find-bloat-again. Relief from the huge stress of that has been the biggest confidence booster’.\nEating for IBS: Naomi Isted’s diet\nIt’s taken years of trial and error but Naomi Isted has finally discovered that certain foods can worsen her IBS. Having said that, there is now nothing she avoids eating altogether, only foods she eats less and those she eats more of. ‘In the past I tried to eradicate everything that bloated me but that only meant that if I ended up in a situation where I had to eat some bread or pasta, the effect on my IBS was ten times worse,’ she explains. ‘Now, I eat the things that don’t bother me in unlimited quantities and have a very little of others that bloat me and – along with taking the Alflorex daily – I seem to have finally got this thing under control.’\nEats little or never…\nPasta (I love it so much I actually do eat pasta once a week, though it rarely agrees with me), rice, white bread\nDairy products such as milk and most cheeses\nProsecco, Champagne or anything with bubbles\nAnything containing gluten\nSalmon and other fish\nVegetables and salad\nApples, bananas, berries\nChocolate (in small amounts!)\nEXPLAINER: HOW ALFLOREX WORKS\nAlflorex, is the result of more than 17 years of clinical research and 75 leading scientific publications. Probiotics contains special bacteria, and different bacteria in the gut have different functions in the body. Alflorex contain contains a probiotic strain called B. infantis3564 which specifically targets and alleviates the symptoms of IBS, such as bloating, tummy pain and unpredictable diarrhoea and constipation. Only recently launched in the UK, the strain is known in the US as Align, where it is the number one probiotic recommended by gastroenterologists for the treatment of the symptoms of IBS. ‘The gut bacteria plays an important role in many digestive health issues,’ says Professor Eammon Quigley, one of the world’s leading Gastroenterologists in IBS and Chief of Gastroenterology at Houston Methodist Hospital. ‘B. infantis 35624, the strain in Alflorex, is one of the few products that has been truly developed on a scientific basis and tested in high quality clinical studies to help the symptoms of IBS.’\nHealthista readers can receive 20% off the marked price.

These conditions include stroke; cancer; head and neck tumors, Injuries, or trauma; and neurological disorders resulting in a chewing or swallowing abnormality. This device (sold in a kit) is intended as an initial placement device. The device is placed by the PULL technique.\nContraindications of PEG Tube\nContraindications for placement of a gastrostomy feeding tube include, but are not limited to colonic interposition, portal hypertension, peritonitis, morbid obesity and esophageal stenosis.\nMIC PEG Tube Pull Placement Procedure\n- Use a clinically approved method to prep and sedate the patient for an endoscopic procedure.\n- Use a clinically approved procedure to perform the gastric endoscopy.\n- With the patient in a supine position, insufflate the stomach with air and trans-illuminate the abdominal wall.\nCaution: Proper selection of the insertion site is critical to the success of this procedure.\n- Select gastrostomy site. This site (typically the upper left quadrant) should be free of major vessels, viscera, and scar tissue.\n- Depress the intended insertion site with a finger. The endoscopist should clearly see the resulting depression on the anterior surface of the gastric wall.\n- Prep and drape the skin at the selected insertion site. Locally anesthetize the insertion site.\n- Following local anesthesia, make a 1 cm (approximate) incision through the skin with the scalpel.\n- Insert the introducer needle system through the incision, advancing through the peritoneum and the stomach wall.\n- When the introducer needle is observed in the stomach, remove the introducer needle from the introducer cannula by firmly holding the cannula hub and pulling back on the needle hub.\n- Insert the retrieval snare intro the endoscope, and push the retrieval snare through endoscope until observed in the stomach.\n- Place the looped placement wire through the introducer cannula into the stomach. Grasp the looped placement wire with a retrieval snare. Withdraw the retrieval snare into the endoscope channel.\n- Remove the endoscope and the looped placement wire through the oropharynx. Pull approximately 5 inches (13 cm) of the looped placement wire from the mouth.\n- Slowly and smoothly feed the looped placement wire into the introducer cannula as the endoscope is retracted. Keep the introducer cannula in place in the stomach with the distal end of the placement loop outside the abdomen.\n- Connect the looped placement wire with the tube loop\n- Lubricate the MIC* PEG Tube with a water-soluble lubricant. Apply traction to pull the placement loop and the tube back through the oropharynx, esophagus, and into the stomach.\n- Re-enter the esophagus with the endoscope and visually follow the gastrostomy tube as it enters the stomach. Slide the introducer cannula out of the incision site and gently pull the PEG dilator tip through the abdominal wall.\n- Use a rotating motion to slowly work the tube up and out until the internal bumper gently rests against the gastric mucosa.\nNote: Graduated markings on the body of the tube will assist in determining the progress of the tube as it exits the abdomen.\nCaution: Do not use excessive force to pull the tube into place. This could harm the patient and damage the tube.\n- Cleanse the tube and stoma site and apply a sterile gauze dressing. Cut the tube loop wire with scissors and discard the tube loop and placement wire.\n- Slide the external bolster over the proximal end of the MIC* PEG Tube and push the external bolster into place next to the sterile gauze dressing. Visually verify that the internal bumper is properly placed. Remove the endoscope. The external bolster should be positioned approximately 2 mm above the skin.\nCaution: Do not apply excessive tension. There should be no compression of the gastric mucosa or the skin. Optionally, a suture loop (not supplied) may be tied around the external bolster to minimize movement of the MIC* PEG Tube while the stoma is healing.\n- Cut the MIC* PEG Tube straight across, leaving an appropriate length to attach a MIC* Feedhead Adapter. Discard the removed portion of the tubing.\n- Slide the clamp on the MIC* PEG Tube.\n- Insert the barb connector of the MIC* Feedhead Adapter completely into the proximal end of the MIC* PEG Tube.", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}
{"id": "412", "text": "In Knoxville, TN, our clinic treats many different skin conditions that can affect different parts of the body. Among the conditions we adeptly manage are keloids, warts, cancer, and psoriasis.\nOur doctors work with primary care providers to treat skin cancer using advanced methods. One of these methods is low-energy x-ray therapy. This treatment is particularly effective for squamous cell carcinoma and allows for quick treatment.\nKeloids, particularly arising from piercings, receive meticulous attention with advanced techniques emphasizing minimal scarring.\nFor psoriasis, affecting different body areas, our personalized treatment plans emphasize symptom relief and overall skin health improvement.\nWe effectively treat different types of warts on the body, including common and plantar warts. Explore below for detailed insights into our approach to these diverse skin conditions.\nA wart is a small, non-cancerous growth on the skin caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV). Warts are generally harmless and can appear on various parts of the body including hands and feet.\nHPV is very sensitive to x-ray therapy. We are able to break down the tissues containing the viral disease. At Heelex, we treat stubborn warts that have not responded well to over the counter topical medications, cryotherapy, or laser therapy. As we kill away the warty tissue, we leave room for new, healthy skin and tissue to grow in place of where your wart had affected the skin. You may experience some redness and skin dryness with this treatment, but this always heals normally and will only last a short amount of time.\nPsoriasis is a chronic skin condition characterized by the rapid and abnormal growth of skin cells, leading to the formation of thick, red patches covered with silvery scales. This immune-mediated disorder occurs when the immune system mistakenly attacks healthy skin cells, causing an accelerated turnover of skin cells. Psoriasis commonly manifests on the elbows, knees, scalp, and lower back, but it can affect any part of the body.\nThe condition is often associated with itching, pain, and inflammation. Psoriasis is not contagious, and while its exact cause is not fully understood, it is believed to result from a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Treatment approaches vary and may include topical creams and oral medications.\nWe use superficial x-rays to target the affected area of the skin. The low-dose of x-rays helps to slow down the growth of skin cells and reduce inflammation of the skin caused by psoriasis.\n“I had suffered for 24 YEARS with pustular psoriasis on my foot. I tried everything and nothing worked out–only worked for a short time. After going to Heelex for treatment my foot has been clear for 2 years!!! Heelex changed my life. Thank you to Heelex and their amazing staff!”\nNon-Melanoma Skin Cancer\nSuperficial X-rays, also known as low-energy X-rays, are utilized in the treatment of certain types of skin cancer. This is particularly effective for treating superficial or localized skin cancers, such as basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma. Superficial X-rays are designed to penetrate only a limited depth of tissue, making them suitable for targeting cancer cells near the surface of the skin while minimizing damage to deeper tissues. This targeted approach helps to destroy cancer cells and prevent them from proliferating. Dermatologists and radiation oncologists often consider superficial X-ray therapy as a non-invasive and well-tolerated option for specific skin cancer cases, particularly in instances where surgery may not be optimal or for patients who are not candidates for other treatments.\n“I highly recommend Heelex for treatment of pain related to arthritis. I am a diabetic and I chose Heelex to treat a benign basal cell carcinoma. The treatment was painless and healed completely without any visible change in my skin. Absolutely thrilled with the result.”\nKeloids are raised overgrowths of scar tissue that can develop after an injury or surgery. Superficial X-ray therapy is utilized to target the abnormal cells in the keloid tissue, slowing down their growth and promoting a more controlled healing response. By delivering focused x-rays to the keloid site, this treatment aims to reduce the size and thickness of the keloid, leading to improved cosmetic appearance and relief from symptoms such as itching or tenderness. Superficial X-ray therapy for keloids is often considered when other treatments, such as corticosteroid injections or surgical removal, have not been successful or are not suitable for a particular patient.", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}
{"id": "413", "text": "How Cables Are Made - Step 6: Jacket Extrusion\nWhen producing cables and wires, every little detail counts. In the sixth part of our series, you will learn how the jacket is manufactured and why it is important.\nMulti-conductor cables - whether with or without braiding - require a jacket. This is what makes a cable complete, as it holds together its various components such as the conductors, braiding and filling materials. However, this is not the jacket’s one and only purpose. Jacketing also protects cables from mechanical stresses such as bending and torsion and makes them resistant to heat, cold, fire, chemicals, water or oil.\nIn order to fulfill the requirements of every application, the right jacketing material must be selected. The range of materials available is wide: in its production facilities, HELUKABEL works with more than 80 different plastics. The most common ones are:\n- Polyvinyl chloride (PVC): Often selected for its low cost and overall resistance to chemicals. However, its mechanical resilience is limited, and it is not always oil resistant.\n- Polyurethane (PUR): High-quality plastic resistant to abrasion, oil and chemicals, suitable for dynamic applications.\n- Thermoplastic elastomers (TPE): Resistant plastics suitable for high mechanical loads and for use in damp and wet rooms.\nThe wall thickness of the jacket can be between 0.2 and 5 millimeters, but most commonly, it is between 0.8 and 1.2 millimeters. HELUKABEL's thinnest jacketed cables have a diameter of just 2.4 millimeters, while the thickest ones reach a remarkable 78 millimeters in diameter.\nSimilarly to the conductor insulation process, the jacket is applied with an extruder. This consists of a metering unit for the plastic granulate, a screw that transports and heats the material, and a cylinder with a spray head that applies the viscous plastic uniformly to the passing cable. Afterwards, the cable runs through a water bath where the jacket cools down and hardens. The jacketed cable is tested with laser cameras and high-voltage testers and finally coiled before it reaches the final step in production: labeling.\nAsk the expert\nMr Sefuenc, what is the difference between the conductor insulation and the jacket?\nIt’s very simple: The conductor insulation has the task of galvanically separating the individual elements in multi-conductor cables. It is therefore applied to each conductor individually and influences the electrical properties of a cable such as the dielectric strength. The jacket, however, protects the inner parts of a cable from harmful environmental impacts as well as from mechanical stress. It has no electrical function. The manufacturing process, though, is the same: both involve a thin layer of plastic that is applied with an extruder.\nWhat factors must be considered during the jacket extrusion process?\nThere are many parameters that have to be considered: for example, the diameter of the cable itself. The thicker the cable, the stronger the jacket must be to withstand all loads. Moreover, the wall thickness must be as uniform and concentric as possible to ensure harmonious functioning and machine processability of the cable, for example when stripping.\nHow do cables actually get their individual color?\nThe color concentrate in the desired shade is added to the plastic granulate in the extruder's dosage unit. In the screw, under the impact of heat, a homogeneous and viscous mass is formed, which is similar to honey. This is applied using a spray head so that the cable comes out of the machine in the color ordered by the customer. Almost all imaginable RAL shades are possible. For some materials, special color batches have to be produced.", "scores": {"score": 3, "score_transform_1": 5, "score_transform_2": 5, "score_transform_3": 0}}

The best brewers make large yeast starters to get their beer fermenting fast, and most of them do so in an Erlenmeyer flask. Large populations of active yeast help ensure flavorful beer free of off flavors. Because this flask is made from borosilicate glass you can move it from a boil into a cold water bath for cooling. This means you can do the whole process in one container, keeping it simple and helping to reduce the risk of contamination when transferring from one container to another.\nDouble Boiler Method\nIt is important for your safety to heat water in the flask with a heat source that distributes heat evenly. Morebeer! recommends using the “double boiler method.” This process involves using a boiling water bath on the outside of the flask to heat up the water inside the flask. All you need is a kettle 3 gallons or larger. This process is much safer and efficient. If the flask should break or boil over, your kettle will be there to collect the contents, thus keeping your stove clean and keeping you safe.\nSafety First: Please take us up on a great deal – save $14.95 when you purchase a 5000ml flask and our BE300 5 gallon stainless steel kettle at the same time. Use Promo code SAFETY1 at checkout.\n- Massive 5L (5000ML) Capacity\n- Made from Borosilicate Glass (also known as Pyrex)\n- Fantastic price for a flask of this size\n- Produced for MoreBeer!\nWhy make a yeast starter? (from our FAQ)\nWe build starters for 3 main reasons. First, to ensure yeast health. By making a starter 1-3 days in advance, you ensure that your yeast is healthy and strong and ready to do its job. Second, to create more yeast. By making the starter you will increase the cell count of the yeast, giving you a better chance of keeping bacteria’s and wild yeasts from fermenting your wort. Third, if you are making high gravity beers. If you are making a high gravity beer (1.060+) you will need more yeast to start the ferment faster. High gravity beers will also finish more completely when you pitch ample quantities of yeast.\nLimited Availability Deal of the Day: As of this posting, this is marked down to $31.99 as a MoreBeer Deal of the Day.

Perhaps you do not have a lot of backyard space, or any at all. But to be a extremely successful vegetable gardener — and to do it organically — you may want to grasp what it takes to maintain your crops wholesome and vigorous. Whereas the thought of growing fruit and vegetables in your individual backyard would possibly sound relatively taxing, the benefits that come along with it are extraordinarily value it. Right here to convince you is 5 advantages of yard gardening.\nLikelihood is you already have many of these components: food, water and shelter in the backyard (together with one or more native vegetation to your space) and earth-friendly gardening practices in maintaining it. The first way to maximize space within the garden is to convert from conventional row planting to three- or 4-foot-broad raised beds. Vegetable gardening may be very primitive, however but somehow refined.\nIf the soil in your yard has by no means been gardened, chances are high your vegetables will do nicely within the first 12 months. You possibly can even interplant crops that develop quickly (radishes) alongside other greens that require a long season (carrots or parsnips), sowing their seeds collectively. Glacial rock dust is particularly valuable as a soil amendment, especially after the first year of gardening has absorbed accessible minerals and nutrients.\nPlanting crops in succession is yet one more strategy to maximize rising space within the garden. While suburbs with correct gardens, and timber, are cooler than densely packed fence-to-fence developments with barely any space between properties. Garden soil must be nicely aerated to promote root development and worm activity.

{"id": "427", "text": "BBQ Tips: Expert-Level Grilling Hacks\nGrilling season is here, and it’s time to take your BBQ skills to the next level. Whether you’re a seasoned grill master or just starting out, these expert-level grilling hacks will help you impress your guests and elevate your BBQ game. So, fire up the grill and get ready to learn some BBQ tips that will make you the ultimate grill boss.\n1. Preparing the Grill\nBefore you start grilling, it’s essential to prepare your grill properly. Clean the grates thoroughly and remove any leftover debris from previous cookouts. This will ensure even heat distribution and prevent your food from sticking to the grates. Additionally, oiling the grates before cooking will help create those beautiful grill marks we all love.\n2. Choosing the Right Cuts of Meat\nTo achieve mouthwatering results, it’s crucial to select the right cuts of meat for grilling. Opt for well-marbled cuts like ribeye, T-bone, or New York strip steak for juicy and flavorful results. For chicken, go for bone-in, skin-on pieces to retain moisture and enhance the taste. Don’t forget to season your meat generously with your favorite rub or marinade for an extra burst of flavor.\n3. Mastering the Art of Temperature Control\nControlling the temperature is key to perfectly grilled food. Invest in a good quality meat thermometer to ensure your meat is cooked to perfection. Different meats require different internal temperatures for optimal doneness. For example, medium-rare steak should reach an internal temperature of 135°F (57°C), while chicken should be cooked to an internal temperature of 165°F (74°C). Remember to let your meat rest for a few minutes before serving to allow the juices to redistribute.\n4. Adding Flavor with Smoke\nOne of the secrets to achieving that authentic BBQ flavor is adding smoke to your grill. Experiment with different types of wood chips, such as hickory, mesquite, or applewood, to infuse your food with delicious smoky flavors. Soak the wood chips in water for about 30 minutes before adding them to the grill to create a steady stream of smoke.\n5. Getting Creative with Grilled Vegetables\nGrilling isn’t just for meat lovers. Take advantage of the grill’s high heat to cook a variety of vegetables and add a healthy and flavorful touch to your BBQ spread. Bell peppers, zucchini, eggplant, and corn on the cob are just a few examples of vegetables that grill beautifully. Brush them with olive oil, season with salt and pepper, and grill until tender and slightly charred.\n6. Don’t Forget the BBQ Sauce\nNo BBQ is complete without a delicious BBQ sauce. Whether you prefer a tangy vinegar-based sauce or a sweet and smoky one, slathering your grilled meats with a flavorful sauce will take them to the next level. Experiment with homemade or store-bought sauces to find your favorite combination.\nWith these expert-level grilling hacks, you’re well on your way to becoming a BBQ pro. Remember to prepare your grill, choose the right cuts of meat, master temperature control, add smoke for flavor, get creative with grilled vegetables, and don’t forget the BBQ sauce. So, gather your friends and family, and get ready to enjoy some mouthwatering BBQ dishes that will leave everyone asking for your secret grilling tips.

{"id": "429", "text": "Many young people who have not started to work, have lots of free time because of their summer holidays, university vacation or the gap months between A-levels and the beginning of university, an apprenticeship or job in autumn. To live abroad for several weeks and get to know a different culture as well as improving language skills is a fantastic way of filling this gap.\nBut spending time abroad is quite expensive as well. So if these young people are keen to get some experience abroad, they can often only afford to go for one or two weeks. That’s not enough to improve a language properly. But there is good news for everybody who wants to spend a few weeks in the summer abroad while improving language skills: The Summer Au Pair!\nTable of Contents\nWhat exactly is a Summer Au Pair?\nA Summer Au Pair is usually a boy or a girl who is interested to spend the summer months in another country, looking after somebody’s children and helping with light household duties. Simply said: A Summer Au Pair is pretty much like a “normal” Au Pair but instead of staying – as usual – for 6 to 12 months, the Summer Au Pair only temporarily lives with the Host Family for a couple of weeks up to three months and typically over the summer.\nThe Summer Au Pair gets also paid pocket money and should be given a private room too. It might even be possible that the Summer Au Pair is given the chance to go on holidays with the Host Family while staying for the summer, so there might be an extra adventure waiting for Summer Au Pairs.\nWhy is a Host Family looking for an Au Pair only in the summer?\nVery often, the parents have to work at least some weeks during the long summer holidays and are unable to look after their children when the school or nursery schools are closed. So, they need somebody to take care of the little ones while the they are at work.\nDue to the fact that the children might be at home the whole day, the Summer Au Pair should be aware of the possibility, that he/she has to take care of the children several hours up to full time during a day (remember, schools are closed) and hence, attending language schools might be somehow more difficult than for a regular Au Pair which normally has time off during the day when the kids are in school or nursery. But a Summer Au Pair will also have some spare time and the weekends off. It is just good to know that a Summer Au Pair may end up having to look after the children really a lot.\nWhat to take into consideration when applying for a Summer Au Pair?\nPlease note, that you have the biggest chance to get hired as a Summer Au Pair when you can spend at least six or eight weeks abroad and the more flexible you are, the better. So students, prospective students waiting for the term to begin or pupils with long summer holidays (Germany, France, Ireland & UK, Spain etc.) can work as a Summer Au Pair in almost every country. Just keep in mind that most Host Families start looking for a summer Au Pair as early as April/May in order to have enough time to find a suitable Summer Au Pair.\nUsually, Host Parents want to hire someone from July till September because it is the main holiday season and schools are closed. So, chances to find a Host Family for the summer are pretty good.\nYou may also find families who look for a Summer Au Pair to start earlier, for example if their last Au Pair needs to leave before the summer for various reasons.\nWhich are the most important things I need to check before starting the Summer Au Pair experience?\nBefore you start to look for a Host Family for the summer months you should be sure about the answers of a few questions which we have listed below. Even though being a Summer Au Pair sounds like a fun and not a too exhausting thing, because it is a limited number of weeks and you will “somehow survive” even if it is more exhausting than expected, you should keep in mind, that the Host Family needs a reliable child care arrangement also over the summer months. Questions you may want to ask yourself include things like:\n- Do I have enough time to stay between July and September? At least one month, most of the time it is easier to find a family for two to three months?\n- Do I want to spend the summer somewhere else with a family I don’t know?\n- Do I accept spending more time than usual Au Pairs with the children?\n- Do I know how to entertain the children several hours?\n- Do I accept going on holidays with somebody I do not know for long?\n- Can I start my other duties after the summer without necessary having had a proper time to relax myself?\nOf course, there are many other important things prospective Summer Au Pairs have to check before applying or moving to the new country. The check-list above only lists some important things Summer Au Pair need to consider.\nIn case you have any question, do not hesitate to contact us. Remember: Being a Summer Au Pair is definitely a good choice if you want to spend the summer abroad but you do not have the money to travel. It might also be seen as a test run to check whether you are able to stay away from home for a longer period of time.", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}

Why did the Warsaw sun decide to come out of the omniscient grey precisely as you settled into the broken chair, painfully squeaky after a year and a half of being abused by your bad sitting habits? Why did the hanging greenery, so full of life and sublimity, almost smirk at you as you peeked your nose out of the dark cave which once used to be your room? Why did the blinking sky force you to breathe deeply and inhale all these views at once when it so clearly took pleasure in your inability to do so?\nIt just so happens that around the time you got used to living without the world around you, it began to scare you, stripping you of the ability to enjoy the simple, experiential pleasures of life. Your newly developed mental disability is pointed out painfully by your entire surroundings, as they squeeze the very last of your sanity out of you.\nYou’re infuriated, offended, and taken aback. And with your eyes fatigued by light, ears dreading the soft sounds, and skin imperiled by wind, you return, gaping at the floor, back to your comfort zone, back to your room, as you reject the world which once meant the most to you.\nThe curtain falls, the comedy ends, but you’re the still life actor, and the world is the laughing audience.\nAnd backstage? Where are the other actors? You’re not sure. For all you know, they might be over the ocean of wooden floor boards, somewhere in the kitchen, or across the forest of paper-thin walls, yet, through which you barely hear any sounds indicating life. A morose silence fills the backstage, or something that used to be a warm home, with an eerie mist, as if it has been haunted by voice-stealing creatures who devour all radiance and vigour from the fellow actors.\nThe Harbinger Prize\nShort Story Competition\nThe Harbinger Prize Competition 2021\nSubmit a short story, no longer than 2,000 words, on the subject line:\nCreate the perfect villain.\nWith the sun already set, you lose track of time. Who allowed the consequential “tik-tok” of the futile wrist-watch, which by now engraved itself into your wooden side table, to cease all work, and allow the hours to reshape and become more of a slack guideline for when the haunted church bells were meant to ring? No-one. There is no-one around, but you. You and the book you were meant to finish two months ago, your pet begging for a walk, and the Netflix opening sound, which seems to be the only divertisement for the sedentary quiet which had begun to force a white hum into your ears.\nWith the world asleep, you should have found peace. Yet, you find yourself anxiously snacking on the week-old bag of crisps, the origin of which you’re not certain. The social media feed becomes repetitive, and your brain forms into a brownish slug, slowly treading in search of something moist to subsist its livelihood. All to no avail.\nIt’s to the melody of your computer, the chirping of your phone, and the slight stench which settled in your claustrophobic cave, that you find the arms of Morpheus. He seems to be the only one who is never disappointing; As he slowly rocks you to and fro, you too settle in the melancholic pit, where, as a hibernating bear, you shall remain until the next day, when the whole show repeats, with the audience amused as ever.\nYou dreamt a dream – someone is bending over you. Shaking frantically, your parents decide to wreak havoc on your disastrously disorganised room. As she forces you out of bed, your mother shouts, piercing her sharp voice deep into your eardrums – you’re late again. Lackadaisically, you throw on whatever was on the chair yesterday, put on the same old jewelry, which by now has acquired a suspiciously green hue slowly transfering onto your finger. Just as you leave your room, the grey clouds outside the foggy window express their sorrow for you – their fat raindrops almost form a maleficent laughter, baptising the ground which you will haunt on your way to the same place which strips you of any creativity and will to pursue every, single, god-given day.\nBack and forth, awkwardly encountering other people’s backpacks and shoulders, you sway, becoming one of the thousands of zombies who had decided to plague the metro system this gloomy morning. Look up! In the glass window of the subway door you see something – the image is convoluted, unclear, as if a milky mass passed through the mirrored creature’s eyes.\nBack bent unnaturally, black under eyes, and a socially awkward smile you put on especially for strangers – this view greets your eyes, rather unenthusiastically. You arrive, finally, yet you must fight your way out of the train station, together with taboons of fellow zombies, never sharing a collective consciousness, yet all having acquired the same goal – get. to. work. Having treaded through constellations of puddles and mazes of curbs – you arrive, at last, fifteen minutes late. Sitting at your desk your body loses all energy, yet is fueled by everlasting anxiety, which will probably run out sometime around five o’clock in the afternoon, when you will be gratefully allowed to repeat the commuter’s track all over again. Next morning, the same screaming, same clothes, same green hue, rain, metro, strangers, work…\nYou woke up sweating. It was only a nightmare.\nThe five o’clock sunrise reminded you of where you were. Yet the day doesn’t begin – it doesn’t exist. The wrist watch stopped working; Who is there to tell you “You must get up now!” The sun slowly increases the pace with which it greets you, rising out of its shy initial position, now fully illuminating your sweaty face. Yet despite its swift apparition, the day still hasn’t arrived. At any stage during the 24-hour realm, on which the population commonly agreed, do you decide to move, do something, feel anything. As you rest in the fetal position, you not only now share the responses of a child, you also physically resemble one. And so you will remain, for yet another show to commence.\nAs the light peeked through the juicy, green leaves, the warm summer breeze grazed your cheeks, and the soft chirping of birds filled your ears with an uplifting mantra, the world seemed to be giving little care about whether it’s comforting you.\nWhether you like it or not, the world runs on recurring elements – your state as of now, the elementary-human position of your mind and body, your entire being, has become a part of this vicious cycle, which recently began to accelerate with further encouragement to antagonise the outside world.\nAt this point, the shape of a trolley problem forms: will you keep going down the track of destruction and lead yourself to an inevitable end? Or, will you switch lanes of the speeding trolley and expose yourself to elements you fear, which you aren’t aware of, which have so far forced you to stay crouching, trying to protect yourself from the unknown?

{"id": "434", "text": "The Douglas Hotel building has been a stable of the scenery of downtown Urbana in one form or another for almost 200 years.\nAnd now, after more than a decade of sitting empty and much debate among community leaders through the years about what to do with the historical structure, the Douglas Hotel is prepping for a new chapter.\nThe Douglas Hotel and the former North and South Elementary Schools are part of a collective renovation project to save the historic buildings and transform them into affordable senior living options.\nIt all started with some local leaders reaching out to Duane Miller, the president of F&C Legacy Place - a branch of Flaherty & Collins Properties - and a developer who has dedicated much of his career to saving and renovating historical buildings across the country.\n“I look for these kinds of historic projects,” says Indiana-based Miller. “It all started from a lead that there were some historic buildings that needed saving in Ohio.”\nConversations led to many meetings between Miller, Flaherty & Collins, the City of Urbana, the Champaign Economic Partnership (CEP), Urbana City Schools' administration and board of education, and Resident Supports and Services, Inc. (RSSI), which is a local non-profit that provides housing for seniors and adults with developmental disabilities.\nThe 17 units that are being built within the Douglas Hotel weren’t enough to secure the funding Miller wanted for the project. So he began looking to include the former North and South Elementary buildings as well.\nWith another 24 housing units to be available between the two schools, Miller says the total of 51 units was more of the scale of what he was hoping for to get the project off the ground.\nThough shutdowns because of the COVID-19 pandemic caused some delays in processing paperwork and funding early this year, Miller says the community-focused group of supporters pushed forward. The project was able to secure $13 million in financing, including federal and state Historic Tax credits, low income housing credits, an Ohio Housing Finance Agency loan, and a construction loan.\n“That’s really how this got pulled off,” Miller says. “This is totally a community effort – kudos to all those who were involved in helping.”\nCEP Executive Director Marcia Bailey says she almost had to pinch herself when work officially started on the buildings because it was like a dream come true after so many years of collaboration and work to get the project started.\n“Today, it looks like ‘ants’ in every building,” Bailey says. “There are construction crews in there, and you can see where they’re working from outside by building by the different lights on in different windows every day.”\nBailey says that though people driving through downtown Urbana won’t see much of a difference outside the building’s front, that behind the building is full of crews working hard to make all the updates to the interior.\n“The Douglas Hotel was the anchor of the Southwest corner of downtown,” she says. “Some thought it should be torn down and others wanted to save it because of it’s history. This is the perfect mix of both; it will be revitalized into something new.\n“The building finally is going to be use. It’s going to be a beautiful building again and not an eyesore with boarded up windows. Just that ambiance of what it’s going to look like, let alone the income that’s going to be generated in the downtown by the merchants – it’s going to be huge.”\nWith more updates to be done to the Douglas Hotel than to either school building, Miller says the plan is for renovations to the school to wrap up in May and for the Douglas living spaces to be ready by the end of 2021.\nHe says lease options will open about 90 days before each project’s completion.\nOne of the things both Bailey and Miller say is most exciting about the projects is the uniqueness that will be offered in each unit.\nBecause the buildings are pre-existing and historic, there won’t be any “cookie cutter” designs. Units will be different sizes with different layouts and designs.\nAnd, some special historic features will be left in the buildings so the flavor of what makes them historic won’t be lost.\nFor example, many of the chalkboards in the school buildings will stay in place and be built into the new living units.\nAlso in the school buildings, the stages and gyms will remain as open community spaces where residents can dance, play bingo, or possibly even watch youth performances. Miller says he’s working with the Champaign Family YMCA to find possible programming and education opportunities.\n“We want to build that community environment,” he says. “You want to create that family and that community feeling.”\nThough Miller himself isn’t from Urbana, he wanted to ensure that the buildings stay meaningful and useful for people locally. He wants them to be a part of the community, and he says the investment from local individuals has been key to the entire project.\n“To their credit, to their teams’ credit – not every community gets in and do what they do,” Miller says. “You need those ‘boots on the ground’ people who care and really get it. You can’t just pull this off just being a developer.

Naturally I spoke with Steven and offered that the Institute would pitch in in any way.\nHe came to Flow through a near-death experience and I through stage performances beginning at age 4. He presented an excellent depiction of Flow with breathtaking pictures of mountain climbers, surfers and other types of Flow state performers well documented and obvious in their beingness in Flow. Surely people can realize that this is another state of consciousness, and will become interested through the efforts of many of us in attaining this state, now that they know we can all do it.\nBut do they believe it? Neither Steven nor I have proven yet that “ordinary people” can become superbeings. Nobody has. Elite military trainers will contend that they do this in a narrow but useful field, and this leads to the larger obvious point that Flow exhibits differently in different people. We all observe it most commonly in sports, which could explain a large part of why sports is such a dominant interest. We see it in great violinists and every other type of musician including those using natural instruments.\nCreatives of all kinds including artists and scientists and improvisational performers experience Flow internally and it is only “seen” to a degree by others around them, who may largely misunderstand, distort and resist the content of the Aha! Vision if it is shared prematurely.\nThe average person when in Flow is unaware of it. It occurs during sex, and in loving communication among human beings all the time. This is the real proof that we can all get into Flow. As we let go into engaging with a loved one without any inner blocks, turned on and driven and focused by love we shift into a state of menschness and rise above every ignoble impulse. We do it out of love. This is ethical Flow, ethics being the instrument we are playing. It is one we can all play.\nThe Aha! Moment is in fact the one “gene” (component, method) that Steven and his colleagues shared. The Flow Genome Project leaders correctly state that the creative process leading up to and including the Aha! Moment — which is the natural creative process as manifested in humans — involves four stages:\nStage 1: Absorb the firehose of information about the challenge\nStage 2: Go away and have fun, forget all about the garbled mountain of info now doing things to itself in your subconscious\nStage 3: The Aha! Moment\nStage 4: Organize and communicate, carry through to real-world implementation validation success of the Aha! Vision\nOutgoing ARF CEO Bob Barocci opened the third day’s session by reporting a conversation he had with Steven. I’ll relate that in the next post. Before I go however I want to say that Bob has done more for the ARF than anyone else. His predecessors were all giants in that field of applied communications psychology we call marketing, advertising and media research. Bob is a Renaissance Man.\nHis predecessor Jim Spaeth had opened up the ARF to whole new ways of thinking and Bob took that to a beautiful extreme inspiring a coalescence of researchers from across traditional, digital, and social, putting the ARF on a firm financial footing for perhaps the first time in its long history. Bob’s successor, the former Chief Research Officer at General Mills, Gayle Fuguitt inherits a solid base and forward momentum to guide in the directions she feels are best for the industry/scientific sub-community, and for society.\nWith Flow and authentic social motives on the agenda, the ARF can lead more than the research industry in the years ahead. There’s an Aha! Vision for you.\nBest to all,", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}

{"id": "437", "text": "Presenting opposite views on nuclear energy\nReports on last week’s groundbreaking ceremony for the Akkuku nuclear power plant in southern Turkey made headlines in many newspapers, including Hürriyet.\nOne of our readers, Müzeyyen Huş, criticized our coverage of the ceremony. “You did not refer to any anti-nuclear power views. You also ran a prominent story on the promotional video prepared by the Energy Ministry regarding the plant. Do you not think readers have the right to know what opposing views are?” she said.\nOn April 4, Hürriyet’s front page had a headline reading “Button pressed to complete Akkuyu by 2023.” On other pages the headlines read: “The first layer of a new age,” “Healthier energy,” and “This is a turning point.” Indeed, there was no coverage of anti-nuclear views.\nMüzeyyen Huş was right. Environmentalists have been speaking out against the project ever since it became clear that a power plant would be built in Akkuyu. Particularly following the accident at the Fukushima nuclear power plant in Japan in 2011, the anti-nuclear movement gained strength everywhere, with some European countries laying out plans to close their nuclear power plants.\nHürriyet did not mention those reactions or the anti-nuclear movement around the world. What’s more, the newspaper did not cover the incident that took place on the very same day, when members of an environmentalist group, the Mersin Anti-Nuclear Platform, visited parliament and police prevented them from demonstrating. We also failed to report critical statements made by some NGOs and associations.\nLater, when it reported Prime Minister Binali Yıldırım’s message to “those who criticize the Akkuyu plant,” Hürriyet used the headline: “Let’s keep a cool head.” However, it did not publish the views of those who are against the nuclear power plant.\nWhether pro- or anti-nuclear voices are right or wrong is immaterial. What really matters from the journalism point of view is giving a platform for all views on such a controversial issue, as readers can make up their own minds only if they have complete information. Simply reporting whatever politicians say cannot provide this complete information.\nIn April 2015, Hürriyet reported protests staged against the Akkuyu power plant when foundations were laid for marina structures and the port. This way, we reported both positive and negative views regarding the nuclear power plants.\nIt is clear that sponsorship is part of cultural life, social life, sports and the arts. Many such events can only take place thanks to sponsors.\nThere is also no doubt that a company or an individual gains something when they sponsor an event. Companies become sponsors because sponsorship effectively serves the function of a commercial.\nŞule Kartal, a communication advisor at a local company, recently emailed me regarding the role of the media in sponsorship relations.\n“On your website’s basketball section, for some time the name of Muratbey Uşak Sportif appears only as ‘Uşak Sportif.’ The company Muratbey is the official sponsor of Uşak Sportif and due to the agreement between them the sports club uses ‘Muratbey’ in its name. I kindly request that you make the necessary corrections,” Kartal wrote.\nThe agreement referred to was made between the club and the company, but it is endorsed by the media. The company inked a deal with the sports club, gives money but it is the media that publishes its commercial for free. In the Super League, football clubs make a lot of money from sponsors but the media gets nothing. What’s more, the line between commercial and news becomes blurry.\nMaybe that is why we should perhaps discuss whether the names of sponsors should be used in sports events or for sports clubs, or whether certain ground rules should be established.", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}

Danish academics have resisted possible repatriation, stating the manuscripts are a part of Danish cultural heritage as well.\nSome Icelandic academics have likewise cast doubt on the utility of bringing certain manuscripts back to Iceland. In 2019, professor Viðar Pálsson at the University of Iceland stated: “From a purely academic point of view, if the manuscripts go home to Iceland, I do not know in what way, if any, it would strengthen scholarship there.”\nHighlighting the potential dangers of transporting historical manuscripts, he further stated: “In the past centuries, people defined what manuscripts were considered Icelandic. Many of the manuscripts would fall into a grey area, but virtually all manuscripts that we can say are mainly Icelandic have been brought back. But there are also some manuscripts that we could describe as rather Icelandic than anything else that we may nevertheless want to recover at some point. Of course, there are manuscripts in the Danish archives containing prized Icelandic sagas, but then there were manuscripts containing more prosaic legal material, royal narrative material and so on that originate in Iceland but are not necessarily Icelandic in content.”\nDespite such objections, Minister of Culture and Trade Lilja Alfreðsdóttir has been eager to acquire the manuscripts on behalf of the Árni Magnússon Institute for Icelandic Studies.\nThe manuscripts in question would be displayed with the latest technologies at the new centre.

{"id": "447", "text": "Episode 23: Michael Griffin discusses his tenure as NASA administrator and the challenges of space exploration\n// Oct 25, 2016\nOn March 11, 2005, President George W. Bush announced his intention to nominate Griffin to serve as the 11th Administrator of NASA. He was confirmed by the Senate on April 13, 2005 and served until January 20, 2009. Griffin knew NASA well. He had been NASA’s associate administrator for exploration in the early 1990s, as well as its chief engineer.\nGriffin holds seven academic degrees—a BA in physics from Johns Hopkins University, a Ph.D. in aerospace engineering from the University of Maryland, and a handful of Master’s degrees.\nHe previously served as deputy for technology at the strategic defense initiative organization (SDIO) in the Pentagon. Griffin’s career has also included academic and corporate positions. He was an eminent scholar and professor of mechanical and aerospace engineering at the University of Alabama-Huntsville and space department head at the Applied Physics Laboratory at John Hopkins.\nGriffin was also president and chief operating officer at In-Q-Tel, a private, nonprofit enterprise funded by the Central Intelligence Agency to identify and invest in companies developing cutting-edge technologies that serve national security interests.\nTime magazine named Griffin one of its 100 most influential people in 2008.\nIn his spare time, Griffin enjoys flying and is a certified flight instructor. He’s also a voracious reader and an avid golfer.\nOn August 14, 2012, the Schafer Corporation announced that Griffin would assume the role of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer at the company.\nGriffin has also been a guest lecturer at IHMC in Pensacola, where in 2009, he delivered a lecture entitled “What the Hubble Space Telescope Teaches Us About Ourselves:” https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvMdORG8OyU.\nIn this episode, STEM-Talk host Dawn Kernagis monitors an interview conducted by co-hosts Ken Ford and Tom Jones, both of whom have a long-standing professional relationship with Griffin.\n1:09: Ford calls Mike Griffin “a remarkable fellow.” Griffin’s work has spanned academia, government and industry. He holds six graduate degrees and was working on his seventh when President George W. Bush selected him to serve as the eleventh NASA administrator.\n2:35: Dawn reads a five-star iTunes review from “Meatballs Mom” entitled “Thumbs up.” “I downloaded this in order to feel intellectually superior to my peers. It’s totally working.”\n3:00: Dawn describes Griffin’s career and educational accomplishments.\n5:13: Dawn introduces Mike Griffin, along with hosts Ford and Jones.\n6:03: Griffin’ interest in science was sparked by the first book, called “A Child’s Book of Stars,” that his mother gave him for Christmas in 1954, when he was five years old.\n7:50: “I was already fully committed to a career in math and science and space long before I got to high school,” Griffin recalls, also noting an influential physics teacher in high school who encouraged him on that path.\n8:25: “My career has gone back and forth between and among DOD space, civil space, robotic scientific space craft and missions and human space flight.”\n8:50: Griffin notes that one of the highlights of his career was being chief engineer for the first space intercept mission accomplished against a booster in powered flight as part of early missile defense program under President Ronald Reagan.\n12:08: “Possibly the coolest job that I’ve ever had,” Griffin says, was as President of In-Q-Tel, which he loosely categorizes as the CIA’s venture capital company. “The CIA didn’t have access to the hi-tech of Silicon Valley, so the non-profit was chartered by Congress to allow that access. It was an extraordinarily eye-opening and exciting adventure,” he says, adding that they helped create Google Earth.\n14:22: Griffin had an early hunch that he would work for NASA, which he did four different times during his career. “NASA formed in 1958, and I was nine years old. I was already interested in space, and from that time forward, I believed that I would eventually work there.”\n15:20: “When I was very young, I thought that being an engineer/scientist was the highest goal anyone could aspire to.”\n16:10: Early in his career, Griffin was also spotted for managerial talent, becoming the youngest group supervisor at the jet propulsion laboratory.\n17:04: Griffin says that he managed NASA, a 20-billion-dollar organization, just as he would a much smaller organization. “What you are doing is trying very carefully to select a great team of people who can complement your own skills, but who are not the same as you,” he says, adding that managing a large organization is not substantially different than a small one—only there are more layers.\n19:50: “Dealing with official Washington” was also challenging during his tenure at NASA; in other words, the organizations that have a stake in what NASA does. And dealing with Congress.\n20:20: Space exploration is one area that can elevate a nation’s profile in history. “I contend that a nation that does not explore frontiers of time is consigning itself to the backwaters of history.”\n21:15: “I believe the values of Westerners are superior to those which have evolved previously or elsewhere. Space is a human frontier, and some humans somewhere at sometime will open it up and settle it; and we will use the resources of the solar system to our benefit. Decisions will be made by nations that show up. I want my nation to be in the vanguard of those efforts.”\n22:25: Griffin explains the Columbia Space Shuttle disaster that occurred in 2003, in which all seven crew members were lost. “It was brought about by the unintended release of a large piece of foam… which impacted a wing at high speed; and broke a hole in the thermal insulation tiles that protect the shuttle on entry, and because of that the vehicle and the crew were lost.”\n22:54: “There was never supposed to be any foam release,” Griffins says, adding that there were continual foam release events that were not understood. “When I took over, I chartered a group of people to study that issue.”\n24:00: The mentality changed from “always three months from flight” to “We’ll fly when we understand why this is happening and can fix it.” They realized they were never going to completely mitigate foam release, but they could have some control over the size of the pieces and when they came off, as well as the damage statistics to the orbiter. Jim Peters of NASA Johnson Space Center was influential in reading statistical properties of foam release and damage.\n26:50: President George W. Bush and Congress supported finishing the space station, but there were “deep divisions of opinion within Washington bureaucracy on whether to do that…. I took it as my most important mission a plan by which we would finish the station.”\n28:04: “We went to our European and Russian partners and outlined a plan by which we would finish the station (by minimizing the number of utilization flights—for scientific experiments—and maximizing assembly flights.) The goal was to get the project finished and utilize it later.”\n29:49: Commercial break: STEM-Talk is an educational service of the Florida Institute for Human and Machine Cognition, a not-for-profit research lab pioneering ground-breaking technologies aimed at leveraging human cognition, perception, locomotion and resilience.\n30:46: “In the immediate aftermath of Columbia, only shuttle flights would go to the space station. If there was another Columbia-like incident, you could park the crew at the station until a rescue shuttle could be used to get them off. Other missions were deemed too risky.”\n31:32: Griffin disagreed with that pronouncement, arguing that there are only a small percentage of things that can go wrong with an orbiter on ascent for which space station is the answer to the problem. The other thing was that there were ways around having a rescue mission (without having an available space station).\n32:40: After joining NASA, Griffin says he “got smart folks from the Johnson Space Center” looking at how we could arrange a safe Hubble repair mission.\n34:00: When the Columbia shuttle was lost, any use of another orbiter for a Hubble-type mission put a delay in the space station completion schedule.\n34:53: Ford recalls the “STS-125 as the highlight of the shuttle program. The afternoon of launch, looking at two shuttles gleaming in the sun, sitting at the ready on their pads…that was an awesome sight.”\n36:10: Jones asks about the inability to launch astronauts to the space station since the shuttles retired in 2011.\n36:50: “The plan was to return the shuttle to flight, finish the space station and construct a new system capable of going to the station and to the moon. It was a U.S.-led international effort to develop a lunar base.”\n38:56: During the [George W.] Bush administration, we opened up a gap between the last shuttle flight and the first flight of a new system. That gap was supposed to have been two years, and it became four.\n39:30: The space station was a 75-billion-dollar endeavor. “I thought we should be doing everything in our power to make sure that it was sustained and used properly. And to do that, you needed to be able to visit the station at least a couple times a year.”\n40:45: Griffin talks about the U.S. government’s increased reliance on commercial space companies, which he says was misguided.\n43:27: Companies developing these capabilities on government funding are saying 2018 is the earliest successful crew deployment from U.S. shores.\n45:18: Griffin calls exploration and science “closely allied enterprises.” “Many explorations in history also yielded important scientific results. But the careful planning of scientific experiments, their conduct, is quite substantially different.” He adds that science is critical to good exploration.\n47:37: “Human space flight is replete with opportunities for life science to advance itself. The two enterprises are synergistic.”\n48:33: “When I took over NASA, the advisory council seemed to have no really useful end. We had a host of individual advisory committees on specific topics.”\n51:40: Griffin organized a NASA advisory council first under Harrison Schmitt and then Ken Ford. All advisory committees reported up through the principals on the NASA Advisory Council who were selected for their expertise in different specialties. “That brought order to discussions/allowed the advisory council to come forward with actionable requests of the NASA career staff; and to shape the budget in ordered/intelligent ways to make better use of the science budget from Congress.”\n53:38: “If we have our wits about us, we will be using robots to augment human exploration and humans to augment robotic exploration in every reasonable way that we can do.”\n55:04: “No one wants people on Mars more than I do, and I believe the best path to do that is through the Moon, which will in and of itself be fascinating.”\n55:45: The vast majority (70 percent) of the U.S. pop supports NASA and its goals. What is missing, Griffin says, is the translation of public approval into coherent policy that can go from one administration to another.\n57:15: Griffin calls space exploration “hobby entertainment for newly elected political leaders.” Their stance towards the Marines, or Air Force, for example, is vastly different.\n1:00:22: Deep space exploration beyond Mars is very difficult without nuclear propulsion systems.\n1:08: Maintaining crew health in closed environments is going to be very difficult. “When we can put a crew on an international space station for 6-7 months and let them de-condition and send them to the moon for a year, back to the space station and then bring them home—then we’ll know we’re ready to go to Mars, and not before.”\n1:02:47: Commercial break: STEM-Talk is an educational service of the Florida Institute for Human and Machine Cognition, a not-for-profit research lab pioneering ground-breaking technologies aimed at leveraging human cognition, perception, locomotion and resilience.\n1:03:30: “We must have a long-term, carefully structured, coherent policy on what the U.S. will do in space, why we will do it, who we will do it with; and how that will be consistent with the funding that we supply.”\n1:06:00: Griffin looks back at Apollo, which “barely succeeded in the political sense.” The White House was cutting the NASA budget during Apollo 11. “’While success was being had, cancellation was occurring,” he says, adding this was “a huge lost opportunity.”\n1:07:27: The success of Apollo was partly due to President John F. Kennedy’s succinct declaration of what was to be done: “Land a man on the moon, return him safely to the earth, do it before decade is up.”\n1:08:00: The U.S. at that time was also in a battle with the USSR for the hearts and minds of the non-aligning nations of the world, he adds. “We felt it was important to be ahead in space.”\n1:08:35: “Apollo probably benefitted from Kennedy’s assassination. It is unlikely we would have been able to go forward had not a martyred president stood behind it.”\n1:12:50: One of the problems across the aerospace industry is that people are not entering the profession. The average age of the NASA work force is in fifties. During Apollo the average age was the twenties. “We need a combination.”\n1:15:12: Griffin wrote a lengthy paper for the 50th anniversary of Sputnik saying that it would have been better to use the hardware infrastructure they had developed during Apollo and repurpose it for other things.\n1:18:12: Griffin paraphrases Wayne Hale, a former shuttle program manager, and space shuttle flight director, in a speech last October in which Hale said that he was tired of the controversy about whether or not we should build a heavy lifter (versus an orbital assembly of smaller pay loads.) “You cannot prove that you would not have been able to do the Berlin airlift with a large number of piper cups, but the logistics would be forbidding… The laws of physics don’t prevent an in-orbit assembly of very large machines to go to Mars by using many smaller launch vehicles. But it is logistically forbidding. It is likely to be much more expensive and time-consuming.”\n1:19:28: “To believe otherwise—that we would not want the largest transportation capability that we could put together—is to single space flight out from all other modes of transportation that humans have ever used.”\n1:21:10: “If we are serious about space exploration, we need a heavy lifter.”\n1:22:22: Griffin says that during the next trip to the moon, we should mine the lunar crust for oxygen. “The lunar surface is a good source of oxygen, and extractable for solar energy. As an industrial process, I believe that’s one of the first things we’ll do.”\n1:23:45: Griffin elaborates on his views regarding the possibility of a commercially-developed space transportation system capable of Mars missions.\n1:29:56: The U.S. partnership in space with Russia and other European nations has been a really good thing. We’ve learned a lot from Russians in space, and they’ve learned a lot from us.\n1:33:38: Ford asks Griffin about his passion for flying. “I’ve been flying for decades, as a general aviation pilot. Flying is consuming. When you’re departing/arriving other concerns don’t weigh on you in that moment. I enjoy that feeling of commitment.”\n1:37:06: Griffin is also a voracious reader. During the period in which the interview was conducted, he was reading “The Innovators” (about the development of the computer industry), as well as “Into the Black,” about the development of the space shuttle. He also likes “junk fiction,” science fiction, The Economist and Science News.\n1:38:30: Another hobby: “I do love golf. It appeals to people with an analytical mind set.”\n1:39:00: Ken and Tom thank Mike for the terrific interview on STEM-Talk.\n1:39:50 Dawn and Ken talk about the interview, direct the listener to the episode’s show-notes, and sign off.", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}
{"id": "448", "text": "Chicago almost hits bottom rank of 150 cities for high cost, poor services\nOut of 150 cities, Chicago came in almost at the bottom when the quality of city services and the total budget per capita were ranked, confirming what most Chicagoans already knew.\nTaxpayers have been asked to pay more for water and sewer use, 3 cents a gallon more for gasoline, rideshares, and other taxes, fines and fees. Chicago’s 10.25% sales tax is the nation’s highest combined rate for a major city. Even listening to Spotify or watching Netflix is hit with a 9% amusement tax.\nThen there are property taxes. On average, from 2000 to 2019, residential property taxes in Chicago rose by 164%. They rose $543 million just during former Mayor Rahm Emanuel’s term and Mayor Lori Lightfoot in her current budget added $94 million in property taxes, plus created automatic annual increases tied to inflation.\nSo when the cost of city government was compared to the quality, Chicago ranked 141 out of the nation’s 150 largest cities, according to researchers at personal finance website WalletHub.\nWalletHub based its rankings on a combination of the quality of city services and the city budget per capita. It measured city efficiency – whether city residents were getting a good return for their tax dollars. Low costs and great services ranked high, while high costs and poorer services ranked low.\nIn addition to an overall score, WalletHub provided individual scores for quality of services and for total budget per capita. Chicago did poorly on both measures, ranking 136th for cost per capita and 140th for service. Washington, D.C., took the bottom spot overall, but even though its costs per person were the highest in the survey it services ranked relatively high in quality at No. 30. Detroit offered the worst city services, with costs ranking at 99th.\nChicago’s heavy tax burden would be less of a problem were taxpayers getting value for their money. High costs in Seattle, Washington and New York City translated into high quality services, WalletHub found.\nSo where is Chicago’s money going?\nChicago’s pension debt is largely to blame for the city’s high expenditures crowding out the public services taxpayers expect for their money and that can protect housing values.\nThe problem will get worse without meaningful pension reform.\nFor fiscal year 2022, the city projected its pension contributions will balloon to $2.25 billion. That amount may underestimate the problem because Chicago recently adopted actuarially-based funding. This would represent, at minimum, a $375 million increase. That amount exceeds the city’s yearly expenditure on City Development, which includes the Department of Housing, Department of Cultural Affairs and Special Events, and Department of Planning and Development.\nIf the yearly increase in pension payments exceeds amounts spent on alleviating homelessness, promoting sustainable growth and providing affordable housing, the city and its residents have a problem. That problem is expected to grow.\nAnnual contributions to city pension funds were already projected to rise by $1 billion during the course of Lightfoot’s first term in office. Even after the $375 million increase expected in 2022, the city’s projections in the budget, which run through 2026, show ever-escalating annual pension contributions.\nDespite Chicago’s rapidly rising taxpayer-funded pension payments, it is unlikely they will be sufficient to meet Chicago’s obligations. The city’s eight pension funds – including the four funds to which the city contributes directly and four funds for related entities funded by the same taxpayers – have accumulated nearly $47 billion in debt, more than 44 U.S. states. Those pensions are only 34% funded overall, meaning they have 34 cents saved for every $1 in future promises. Pension experts consider plans below 40% funding to be past the point of no return and on the path to insolvency or major cuts.\nThe money to fund these pensions must come from somewhere, and keeping up with this growing financial burden is a core reason Chicago taxes have increased in recent years. For the most part, recent city tax hikes have not been implemented to provide better roads or sanitation or to reduce the violence plaguing the city. Rather, taxpayers have seen their burdens increase largely in order to fund pension systems.\nLocal politicians understand runaway pension debt is an issue, yet little has been done to address the problem. Lightfoot herself has sent mixed messages on pension reform, often acknowledging the depth of the problem and calling for change while failing to provide specifics. She has criticized 3% compounded post-retirement annual raises as “unsustainable,” but has not publicly endorsed a constitutional amendment, which is the only way to change them. In contrast, in his last months in office, Emanuel called upon Springfield to send a pension reform amendment to the ballot for voter approval.\nIn addition to being primarily responsible for Chicago’s increasing tax burden, pensions have also begun crowding out core government services.\nThis trend has been particularly noticeable at the state level, but it has also begun manifesting itself at the local level. Since 2011, Chicago’s inflation-adjusted pension payments have increased by 239%. At the same time, city spending on services has increased by just 18%.\nIt is this dynamic that largely prevents Chicago from providing services on par with its high-tax peers in New York and Seattle. Both cities levy high taxes, but in the absence of crushing unfunded pension debt they are able to direct those taxpayer dollars back toward services for their citizens.\nCity leaders know the rapid rise in pension costs has hurt Chicago’s ability to invest in the core services valued by residents, yet meaningful reform has remained elusive. Rising taxes and declining services can be expected until the state amends the Illinois Constitution to allow for the control of future government pension growth.", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}
{"id": "449", "text": "Seeing a new continent, country or city can be overwhelming and exciting, even for regular travelers. Before you get your flights booked and bags packed, take a minute to read through the following tips to help you minimize travel stress and maximize your vacation enjoyment.\nIf you have children traveling with you, make sure you have a current, color photo of them with you, in the event they become lost. Losing track of a child can be very frightening. The fact remains, however, that it is not unheard of. If you have a picture of your child on hand, it can really help to locate him or her in a crowd more quickly.\nPlan ahead if you want to travel by air. Most airports are close to major urban areas, making them difficult to get to at busy times of day, like rush hour. Do all of your packing the day before. Get your preparations ready before you fly. It feels terrible to miss your flight.\nWhen vacationing in a foreign country, be careful what you eat. If you do have an allergy, you will need to have a good handle on the language of the country you are eating in. You’ll be able to tell waitstaff in restaurants about your allergies before there’s a problem and you have to explain to medical professionals.\nLook at your alarm when you get to a hotel. You do not want to be subject to the alarm needs of the previous guest. Make sure you check the alarm clock and make sure it’s set for a time that is good for you;, otherwise, you might find yourself off to a terrible start on your vacation.\nWhen it comes to planning your trip, choose a digital camera that is in sync with your trip and its needs. If you want to go backpacking, you’ll want to pack a rechargeable battery. In nearly all cases, a digital camera with an that focuses quickly is best to avoid missing that perfect shot.\nIncrease safety at hotels by bringing along a door stop. You may not have access to the type of security that you think is acceptable. If you don’t find a chain or deadbolt on the door, put a small doorstop beneath the door at bedtime.\nWhen flying on a plane, you should plan ahead because an airline won’t always be able to meet your basic needs, even when the flight lasts for many hours. Be sure to bring a blanket, headphones or pillow if you think you’ll need them. You may also want to purchase a snack before boarding the plane.\nMake sure that you have clothespins with you on your next vacation. They can be a useful item when you go on a trip, even though they are not something someone thinks to bring with them.\nSign up for a travel price watcher. This is a feature many travel sites use, and allows you to enter the destination you want and it will watch for deals for you. When the hotel or airfare price drops by the amount chosen, the site ends you an email alert. This takes the work out of your needing to check the prices everyday.\nWhen to travel by plane or car with a toddler, make sure you have enough fun things to keep them occupied. Pack some of his favorite games and toys. It is also a good idea to buy a new toy just for the trip, as it will provide a little novelty and help keep a small child’s attention.\nWhen you are going to some type of attraction, print online tickets in advance. Even if there’s a fee, it is very much worth it to be able to skip the long lines for purchasing tickets at the venue. Also, parks sometimes offer timed entry, and if they do, you can use your tickets to get right to the admission line.\nWorkout at the gym the day before you take your flight. Long flights are taxing on your body and nerves. Not to mention the effects sitting for long time can have on your body. You can have more energy at the end of your flight when your warm up and stretch before takeoff.\nBring a business card with you at all times. This will help you get directions from locals if you get lost. It is particularly useful for those who haven’t mastered the language.\nConsider buying bottled water once you arrive or melt the hotel ice to get filtered water for making coffee. Rather than drinking tap water, put ice in the ice bucket and let it all melt overnight. In the morning, you will be able to brew a better-tasting coffee with this water.\nYou should be aware of the insurance policies available from your credit card company and their particular policies involving foreign countries. You might be already covered for cancelled flight that get charged to the card. It will be worth it to do this research prior to your trip.\nFind out as soon as possible whether you require a visa to enter the country you are travelling to. Visas often have a lengthy processing time so you should apply for them as soon an you are thinking of travel. If you do not have a visa and your destination requires it, then you will not be able to enter.\nWhen making a hotel reservation, ask if the hotel is doing any renovations. There are few things more annoying than waking to the sound of construction equipment while you are enjoying a vacation. Avoid staying in a hotel that is undergoing construction.\nIf you use traveler’s checks, make sure the cash them prior to dining or shopping. Traveler’s checks are generally accepted at most places, but they are a hassle. Rather than using these, get local currency to spend.\nDeserts have great views and interesting plants and animals. Visiting the desert for the first time can be an especially exciting adventure; it’s something you should do at least once during your lifetime, just to experience the awe and wonder of the desert.\nIf visiting National Parks is in the cards for your vacation, consider purchasing an official National Park Pass. It’s only $50 annually, and it covers your entry to all the national parks.\nSometimes, the best way to deal with a red-eye flight is to have a sleeping pill to take once you are settled on the plane. Many people find it difficult to sleep on an airplane, between the unfamiliar surroundings, uncomfortable seats, and passenger and aircraft noise. If you want a surefire way to make it through your flight, try taking a sleeping pill in order to relax, calm down and sleep through it. Don’t take any pills until after the plan has taken off. If there is an issue or delay you would be sleeping in the terminal!\nIf you plan to hit the road with a small child, take breaks every two or three hours on the road. Breaks give you the chance to stretch out and go to the bathroom. If you get your kids away from the car now and then, you can keep them from getting motion sickness. Your trip might get longer, but you will appreciate the drop in stress.\nDocumentation is key, so be sure to discover what kinds of visas you will need to enter any countries you will be traveling to. Acquiring a visa can be a lengthy process, so do not wait until the last minute to apply. If you don’t have the correct visa, you won’t be allowed to enter some countries.\nAny great vacation can go awry if proper research time is not used in the planning. Search the Internet for travel reviews from people who have already been to that location. Their experience can help you avoid staying in a dangerous town or seedy hotel.\nUse environmentally responsible services to ensure your vacation is eco-friendly. You can save money on electricity by not overusing the bulbs. Car rental companies, tour operators, restaurants and other service providers are implementing ways that allow travelers to be able to travel green.\nThink about what type of transportation you’re going to use. The bus has changed a lot over the years. You can get affordable tickets on buses that are clean, have free wireless Internet and even electrical outlets. You might find bundle deals from some bus lines that will make your planning simple.\nPack a couple of travel candles for your hotel stay. Scented candles can eliminate offending mystery scents in hotel rooms. Candles are relaxing, give off a wonderful glow and are romantic. You can buy these candles in miniature sizes, and they are usually drip free.\nIf issues arise with regard to travel plans, it can be quite frustrating. Flights are cancelled and rental cars disappear. In these predicaments, the only two who can handle the problem are the agent and you. You may get frustrated while trying to sort out the problem. Stay calm and be polite. You can get more accomplished this way.\nFind the service stops on your journey while driving. You never know when you are going to hit a long, isolated stretch of highway. When planning your route, look for possible service stations that will be able to service your vehicle. Keep the numbers handy in case you need to use them.\nKeep flight delays to a minimum by booking a flight as early in the morning as you can. Airports are typically filled to capacity; if the first plane is delayed there is a domino effect, because each plane must wait for the last one to fly out and make room at the gate. Morning flights have less chances of being delayed.\nActivities help take the boredom out of road trips. Rather than just taking meal and bathroom breaks, the trip will be more entertaining. Give your kids an itinerary of your route so they can focus on that destination en route to the main location.\nIf traveling abroad, write out some cards that contain dietary restrictions in the language spoken by locals in your destination country. If you are a vegetarian or a vegan, you can use this idea to let your servers know what you can and can’t eat. This information can help to ensure that all your dining experiences are enjoyable on your trip.\nIf you don’t like flight delays, get the earliest flight you can. Since airports are usually filled to their capacity, if one plane is delayed, more then likely the plane after that will be delayed, too, since it has to wait for the gate to open up. The first flight during the morning is very limited with delays.\nMake certain to pack your medicines. When a person is preparing to leave for a trip or vacation, they sometimes forget to pack the most important items, including medications. Your destination location may not have the ability to fulfill your prescriptions, especially through your insurance plan.\nDon’t forget to pack your child’s car seat when you hire a rental car. The car seat that you own is probably better than the one a rental company would supply, and your seat is one that your child is comfortable with.\nDo not use the airport to exchange currency. It is very convenient to do it there, but the rates are typically sky high. You can avoid having to do this by searching out nearby banks and exchange centers prior to embarking on your travels.\nWhen you go on a trip, don’t forget your contact lens case. If you are only using a small bit of these products, carry them in one of these containers.\nBe sure you have enough time when it comes to checking out of the hotel. A lot of hotels will charge you steep fees if you don’t manage to check out of your room by the time that they specify. You definitely always want extra check out time.\nWith these tips in mind, your next trip could be the journey of a lifetime. No matter your level of travel experience, you can look forward to a great trip.\nMake sure contact information listing your name and telephone number is on a label which can easily be found inside your luggage. If you lose your belongings, someone might return them to your address. The more times you see your luggage, the more chances you have in preventing losing your belongings.", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}

The following advice has been well-tested and can go far in helping you succeed.\nBefore you start working in a room, decide the kind of mood you want the room to present. The mood of a room can range from calm and soothing to exciting and outrageous. Deciding on the mood of the space beforehand will have a big impact on the choices you make and will help to give the space a cohesive feel.\nMix patterns and textures to create a sophisticated design in any room. These textures help to draw the eye and add interest to otherwise boring items. If you are trying to make your room look better, you have to mix up your colors and patterns.\nKeep art at eye level to maximize the effect of your investment. Hanging a piece of art too high or too low throws the balance of your room and can even make the room look smaller and more disorganized.\nLower the costs of your interior decorating projects by seeking out the same high quality designs from mass merchants. It is not always necessary to pay designer prices for the high end designer look. Only purchase the designer brands when you cannot find a comparable, inexpensive alternative.\nKeep your room as uncluttered as possible when you are making changes to your interior’s design. Using too many pieces of furnishings, the room can look smaller and cramped. Use only a select few pieces of key furniture, and keep plenty of open space.\nWhen choosing furniture to place in a small room, look for pieces that have versatility. For example, use an ottoman in lieu of a sofa or chair. The ottoman not only provides seating but can also be used as a table, making use of the small amount of space you have. Using things that have two purposes could help you maximize a small space.\nWhen you are decorating, keep the room’s purpose in mind. You should think about who may be present in the room and whether or not there is ample space. Keep family and friends in mind while designing your living-room, however focus on you and your mate when designing the bedroom.\nWhen working on the room of a child, think of everything from a little kid’s perspective. Small children do not view their room in the same manner that you do. It’s important to use furniture and items that are made for a child’s height and easy to access with their small hands. Look at the things from the child’s point of view to avoid doing anything hazardous.\nWallpaper only a portion of your wall to save money. It can be very expensive to redecorate your walls. Therefore, just put wallpaper on half the wall in order to save some money. Coordinate the wallpaper with a border that’s bold then choose a paint color for the rest of the wall. Your home will show a touch of class while your wallet takes less of a beating.\nOnly half of the wall could be wallpapered. It can be very expensive to redo the walls. To save some money, apply wallpaper to half a wall only. If you put a border between wallpaper and paint it creates a interesting look. This can help you save money while maintaining the style that you desire.\nDo not try to save money by choosing a lower-quality paint. Cheap paint not only wears away, but it can damage your walls and cost more in the end. Buy paint that will last in your rooms.\nHave a style in mind when designing your rooms. Things should be attractive when you have company, but you are the one who will spend the most time in your home. Regardless of what others may think, do what makes you happy. If you find that you feel too bold, you can always make changes with time.\nLighting is very important when you are thinking of remodeling a room. This is because lighting creates a certain mood. Kitchen and bathrooms require adequate lighting in order to function properly. In contrast, though, bright lighting can spoil the effect you’re shooting for if you want to make a room feel calmer and more subtle. Dimmer lights are great for bedrooms, living rooms and other rooms meant for relaxing.\nMany people have smaller rooms that they wish appeared to be bigger. Apply a light colored coat of paint to make your smaller spaces seem larger. The general design rule is the darker the paint color, the smaller a room will appear.\nBe open to painting options that do not only use solid colors. You can find some great tutorials online if you want some amazing designs. With a creative feel from these online tutorials you can figure out how to truly improve the interior of your home.\nStep outside your comfort zone when painting an area of your house. You can find some great tutorials online if you want some amazing designs. Get creative when choosing wall paint designs to create a stunning look room.\nIf you have the desire to increase the amount of light in a room, add mirrors so that they are across from your windows. As long as the mirror is big enough, it will reflect light back into the room, almost creating a second window. The room will appear brighter and lighter.\nUpdating your home’s accessories is a great interior decorating tip. Change out accents and light fixtures in the room. Matching tea towels can create a personalized look to your living space too. Not every room will need major changes and you do not need to spend a lot of money.\nWhen you are looking at brightening up a room with a fresh coat of paint, it is best to use white on your ceiling. Ceiling white is a specialized, high-gloss paint that reflects light well. When you use it, you will notice a huge difference in the room’s lighting.\nIn the living room, all your furniture does not need to face the television. Placing chairs in a different part of the living room can be a great idea. You can sit down and relax with a friend while enjoying a cup of tea.\nHow long do you want to live in your current home? If you plan on leaving before five years, you may want to stick to neutral designs. While you may appreciate the look of vivid purple carpeting, there’s a good chance that your tastes may not be shared by the next person.\nFor a smaller space, a great trick for broadening the feel is to incorporate plenty of mirrors. Mirrors make a room appear larger than it is, which should help make the room look better. Try buying a mirror or two to use in your new design scheme.\nBe careful of hanging newly acquired art too low or too high on your walls. Between 8 and 10 inches above your sofa is the ideal height for any art in your room.\nEliminate clutter and over-sized furniture from small rooms. Consider obtaining good storage for the items that typically clutter your room. Put all of the miscellaneous toys and papers sitting around into storage. Bins and cabinets take up less space than clutter.\nArrange storage boxes in your child’s playroom within his reach. This lets children keep their own space neat by storing and sorting their toys themselves. A well organized toy room can double as an office or a guest room.\nWhenever you are repainting a room, use “ceiling white” to paint your ceiling. It’s a popular color that designers use to help reflect light to make a room look different than it really is. This will add drama to your room and make the ceiling appear higher.\nLight colors like white or cream help to brighten and open up a room. This can do wonders for cramped quarters. Utilizing the right types of colors can add an instant sense of space.\nGive some thought to traffic patterns in the living room as you place furniture in it. Your goal is to fit the furniture into the room and still give people enough room to move around. You want to avoid the occurrence of a traffic jam.\nIf your bathroom features white tiled floors, opt for a bright, colorful shade for walls. You can use a bright green, bold blue, or a deep red to really accent the tiles. This gives the appearance of brighter looking tiles. You can also easily change it later if you want to.\nIf you want to incorporate a green design in your bathroom, salvaged materials might be just what you are looking for. You can find materials from antique tiles to sinks that have all been recycled. A combination of recycled and new materials add an interesting design to your room. You can have a great looking room while saving money and being eco-friendly.\nIf you have children in your home, you may want to consider using slip covers. Slip covers are very versatile, as you can match them to the colors of your furniture. You can even change the pattern with the seasons to make things more fun.\nWhen working with a smaller space that has many different rooms, you should make the designs fit together seamlessly. Purchase bar stools that match your dining room set if the two rooms are together. So, when shopping for pieces of furniture in this situation you should try and get pieces that go well with both the dining and living area. Shopping for both spaces at once is a great idea. Try to find pieces that coordinate.\nUse a ceiling paint that is two shades brighter when compared to the room walls. If you don’t, over time the entire room can start to feel much smaller than it is. Having bright ceilings will expand your room.\nUse baskets to give your small bathroom more storage space. There are many different kinds of baskets that will suffice. Baskets can be used to hold magazines or bath towels. They can also be suspended from walls or placed beneath a vanity.\nDecorating with light neutral tones of white and cream can help a small room seem airy and spacious. This can help improve the look of a smaller room that feels congested. Make sure to select a color that complements the design and available space in the room.\nThink about how many people will be using a room when you are designing it. Is your social life small and intimate, or big and exciting? Remember, each room in your home needs to be approached differently, depending on the rooms needs. As you can see in your home, not all rooms are designed in the same way. With these ideas in mind, you can better design your home.\nMake sure all sconces are strategically placed. Let the piece have its own personal space. It all depends on the size of the mirror, but step back and give it a good look before you doing any hanging.\nA really good interior design tip is to always use consistency when decorating throughout a home. After all, there is a big difference between an eclectic style and one that is all over the board with little rhyme or reason. Knowing this difference can make or break the success of your projects.\nYou don’t have to have overpriced professionals and tons of design magazines in order to do your interior planning. You can learn everything you need with a little research and some honest thinking about how you want to use your space. The preceding advice can get you started on the path to design.\nA great interior design tip is to make sure your blinds and drapes go with the rest of your room. If your blinds do not match, they will stick out like a sore thumb and take away from your overall presentation. You also have to make sure they match other things in the room, such as the sofa or bed.\nmattress and box spring encasements, however, they are not always aware of how to do so on their own.

{"id": "452", "text": "Published on July 25th, 2019 | by Scott De Lacy\nNight Call PC Review\nSummary: Great for a single play-through, but no incentive to replay.\nOne shot wonder\nThere is a killer on the loose in Paris, and somehow you managed to get caught up in the middle of it. You, a simple taxi driver find yourself responsible for investigating and tracking down the killer, and must do so only by driving your cab and speaking with your passengers.\nWell, it is a fresh take on this genre and as a concept, almost ground-breaking. The story starts with very little introduction to your character; you have a short prologue and learn you have been shot, waking up in hospital, having your life turned upside down, the events begin to unfold, whereby you are then tasked by the detective to start investigating the killer.\nThe gameplay style is entirely in black and white and uses striking contrast shadows and shading in a pseudo comic book style of fixed foreground scenes with 2-3 point fixed character animations and moving non-descript background scenery of the road, that are triggered during different dialog. Most of the game takes place inside your taxi, and as you drive along you occasionally see transitional scenes of the taxi in 3rd person perspective, and scenes of the city of Paris. In true fashion and expectation, it is a very romantic theming that is wrapped in mystique and is at first very striking and complimentary to the game, which draws you into the story instantly.\nSurprisingly the passengers are very diverse and each has their own character and biography. The dialog in the game is unique to each character and there is a sense of ‘finger on the pulse’ with each viewpoint and political perspective. This aspect of the game is actually quite well thought out and the characters really are interesting for the most part, but there are of course exceptions.\nThe game play is really simple, you have to do your day job by driving the taxi during the night shift and earning enough fares to cover your fuel and bosses cut. Of course, you only have a limited time during your shift to earn money, gather information and interact with your passengers. The gameplay difficulty is based on the ability to earn money. Story mode makes it easier, where as you can make it near impossible to earn money. The catch of course is that if your bank balance goes to the negative, you will be fired and therefor can’t investigate the crime. Game over.\nUnfortunately, the first few days of playing this game was next to impossible. There was constant freezing, black screens, unclickable areas, passengers that ended all choices in the game etc. After about 4-5 Steam client updates that were released over 3 days, the game became playable; but a few bugs still existed such as some passengers that caused an unrecoverable state of game play with absolutely no possibility to advance. Also the map showing the Taxi’s movements also failed constantly. Looks like Steam has again, blessed this game with additional ‘features’.\nDespite this, there are 3 stories in the game, each with a different level of difficulty. I played the first one and I was impressed with the story. It was well written, very interesting and enjoyable. Then I started the 2nd story, and it included all of the early dialog of the first story. After 20 minutes of constantly clicking away the repetitive text that I have already experienced, including passenger dialog, I decided that was enough for me. Keeping in mind, that yes you can skip the dialog, but the story started the same, the dialog was the same, the passengers were the same, the antagonist was the same and it was the same interaction with your character.\nThere is little doubt that at some point the story would offer some unique content; it was just too excruciating to continue playing to get to that point. It is sad, because the stories offered by the game are no doubt well written, but it feels like a bit of a cheat to offer 3 stories that utilise the same dialog, without so much as a twist or hook to recapture the audience.", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

Invited to the conference organized by Gruppo Sanpellegrino on October 6, the five-star chef from Modena, owner of the famous Osteria Francescana di Modena, he spoke of the Made in Italy brand. A speech on the communication of the great values of our country, to export along with the sentiment of Italian entrepreneurs, especially those of the micro excellence sector.\nIn order to promote the Made in Italy brand and disseminate it even more effectively, we must look at ourselves in the mirror and not lose ourselves in routine, in everyday problems, but look at it from a distance. At that point you get a defined and clear image of what Italy is and you can become an ambassador yourself of what represents the greatness of our country.\nStarting from this assumption, what is Italy’s true problem? It is to be able to communicate in a truthful manner what exactly is its greatness, biodiversity, microclimate, and the strength of its diverse locations. For me Italy is all this, an incredible agriculture and food producer, ample coasts in the middle of the Mediterranean, mountains of the north rising above all the other European countries. Italy is the mist in the Padania plains which allows us, with a little poetry in our hearts, to see it as something essential for producing balsamic vinegar, for curing the culatello or seasoning Parmigiano Reggiano.\nItalians must rediscover within themselves that sense of poetry that has always been in their DNA. Our entrepreneurs have always been great dreamers. Their enterprises, which, compared to French, American, Chinese or Japanese ones are “micro” enterprises, however, still express emotions. We have always been on the forefront of micro enterprises of excellence that have represented our strength and I believe this has been our strength and backbone: we have to start again from there. The secret that allows us to rebuild a great Italy is found in the Renaissance store.\nby editorial staff", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

Such quick sales are almost always at a steep discount.\nSolves the Problem of Insurance\nMost insurance is sold to provide for the surviving spouse or for the children of the parents in the event that both die.

They'll go off at 11:38 a.m. ET on Thursday and 8:42 a.m. on Friday.\nHow to Watch\nThe Masters is known for having some of the skimpiest TV coverage of any major sporting event.\nESPN will have live TV coverage from 3-7:30 p.m. ET on both Thursday and Friday.\nThose sites will also have coverage from holes 15 and 16 from 11:30 a.m.-7:30 p.m. ET.\nFitzpatrick hasn't played his best golf of late. He was eliminated in the group stage of his last start, the WGC Dell Match Play, and has yet to pick up a top 10 on the season. But it's not his first time around Augusta, which is a sizable advantage; the course tempts players to take risks and first-timers typically struggle. Fitzpatrick has some experience and will have a game plan as to when he wants to attack and when he'll play it safe.\nThat being said, don't expect too much from the young Brit. Augusta typically favors long hitters and many holes call for a left-to-right draw shape off the tee. Fitzpatrick doesn't hit it short by any means — he averaged 286 yards per drive on the European Tour last year — but his strength is his accuracy and his short game, and he prefers a fade off the tee. At least on paper, Augusta doesn't suit Fitzpatrick's game to a tee.\nWith that being said, he's a quality, quality player. You don't get to the top 50 in the world at just 21 years of age by accident. And at the Masters, anything can happen. Don't be surprised if Fitzpatrick puts together two solid rounds and gives himself a chance to post a solid finish.\nVegasinsider.com has Fitzpatrick at 250/1 to take home the green jacket.", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}
{"id": "470", "text": "It’s no secret that subway tiles are hugely popular at the moment. In fact they have been for a while now but there’s no sign of this trend disappearing any time soon. We’ve been looking for some subway tile inspiration for our latest project, and thought we’d share some of our favourite styles to help with your next project.\nThe Diverse Tile Style\nPart of the enduring appeal of subway tiles is that they can work in virtually any setting, whether you’re looking for inspiration for a modern bathroom or a traditional kitchen, there’s a subway tile and grout combination to suit your project.\nThis kitchen uses a basic white subway tile in an interesting way by tiling right up to the ceiling. Where your room is too small for wall units or lacks the head height, a couple of open shelves on a fully tiled wall can make an interesting feature in an otherwise potentially bare space.\nIn a completely different setting, these gloss grey subway tiles prove their versatility by blending the divide between the modern wood effect on the upper wall with the traditional mosaic pattern on the floor of this bathroom. They really are suitable for any design scheme, even when that scheme involves both new and old elements.\nIf you’re looking to make a bold statement with your kitchen or bathroom, then again subway tiles are ideal given the huge range of colours they come in. Take these bright red gloss tiles as an example. Matched against simple white kitchen cabinets they are a much more cost effective way of creating an interesting space than opting for more expensive cabinets. Add a few complimentary accessories and you can create a really impressive visual effect.\nIf bright red isn’t your style, this bathroom shows a much more traditional look created with a fern green tile that adds a splash of colour and brightness to this en-suite without being overpowering. There seem to be two schools of thought in the investment market at the moment regarding colour. One is still stuck in the world of magnolia, whilst the other (particularly in the HMO world) is embracing bright feature walls. I find this middle ground a much more appealing look that will attract a much wider audience without being too garish.\nWhite grout is the go-to answer for most tilers who aren’t told otherwise. Whilst it can create a bit of a boring result, when used in the right way the effect can be striking. Coupled with the grey subway tiles, the white grout pops out and makes the brick bond pattern in this bathroom really stand out. This is a great example of a contrast grout used without adding too much personal taste to a project.\nFlipping the colours on their head can have an even more striking result, like in this example of a high gloss white tile alongside a really dark grey grout. In this case it adds to the traditional feel of the dark shaker cabinets but can equally work in a modern setting.\nFinally, you can really push the boat out with virtually any coloured grout you can imagine. Most tile shops now offer a wide range of grout colours, with some specialists able to mix any colour you want. Whilst this particular example would suit a vibrant house share/HMO, I also think it would make a flip or single let aimed at young professionals really stand out in a boring, vanilla market.\nIf you’re considering subway tiles but want to do something a little more creative with them, you can also look at changing the way they are laid. Typically laid in a straight horizontal or brick bond pattern, this can start to look a bit dull after a while. Simply rotating the tiles 90 degrees can completely transform the look, like in this minimalist bathroom. A horizontal pattern would look fairly traditional, whilst this vertical arrangement reminds me of something almost futuristic.\nIf you’ve got a competent tiler you can trust then even more creative patterns can be trialled, like this herringbone style wall effect using subway tiles. The staggered edge along the top is so unusual and adds a really special feature to this kitchen that I haven’t seen before, particularly when you add dramatic contrast with the paint as well.\nUsing Multiple Colours\nYou might argue that black and white aren’t technically colours, but you know what I’m getting at! Combining two or more different subway tiles can add real interest, particularly if you plan on tiling full walls as it can help break up a room. This simple example uses a black stripe almost like a picture rail to add more character to a traditional style bathroom.\nAt the other end of the spectrum you can really go to town and use a whole range of different colours to create a bright and energetic display, laid in a random pattern like this wall or used to create a large scale mosaic. When you start to combine different coloured tiles the options are endless, as long as you’re brave enough to create it.\nWhether your investment strategy is single lets for families or HMOs for students, serviced accommodation for travellers or flips for high-earning professionals, subway tiles can be used in any setting to create an amazing effect in both kitchens and bathrooms.\nHopefully we’ve given you some inspiration on how to use subway tiles in your next project, and we haven’t even mentioned using them on the floor yet… Follow us on Instagram for more interior design and property investment inspiration.", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

{"id": "477", "text": "For Valentine’s Day, Talend published a fun infographic, “Use Big Data to Secure the Love of Your Customers.” It lists data quality as the second leading challenge with Big Data, but perhaps more striking is the $13.3 million annual financial impact caused by data quality problems.\nI’m not entirely sure from the graphic which research group provided that stat, but a 2013 Gartner research paper put the cost higher, at $14.2 million a year.\nActually, there’s no shortage of scary statistics and numbers on the high cost of bad data. For instance, this infographic by Lemonly.com and Software AG notes that bad data:\n- May cost businesses as much 10-25 percent of an organization’s revenue each year. (Ovum Research puts it higher, at 30 percent of revenues, according to Informatica.)\n- Costs the U.S. economy over $3 trillion a year.\n- Adds up to $314 billion to health care costs.\nNumbers like that are impressive, but perhaps overwhelmingly vague. What does it mean to say data quality “costs” an organization 10-30 percent of revenues? How is that determined? And will fixing it cost more?\nA recent piece by Dell Boomi CTO Michael Morton puts some specifics to data quality’s cost by looking at how bad data changes a hypothetical direct mail marketing campaign.\nIn his example, you’ll spend $20,000 each month on a campaign to “a highly targeted set of 100,000 customers in a specific market.” Even if you exclude employee time and operational costs, the mailing requires $240,000 for the year.\nIn previous years, this mailing has generated revenue of about $500,000. So, you’re profiting $260,000 each year from sales.\nHow does poor data quality change the equation? Morton assumes an error rate of 50 percent, which he notes is not uncommon for enterprise sales and marketing departments. That’s bad data in the form of duplicate entries, incorrect addresses, outdated lists and other errors.\nBecause 50 percent of your mailings are lost, you’ve cut the revenue in half — making your profits for that program a mere $10,000. Add in employee time and other operational costs, and you’re most likely losing money, he adds.\nSo, it’s easy to imagine how the average company could waste “$180,000 per year simply on direct mail that does not reach the intended recipient because of inaccurate data,” as Lemonly.com claims.\nThat’s just looking at one small area, but it’s not hard to imagine how that might create problems with customer service, safety recalls or suppliers.\nData quality can also add costs to IT systems such as Configuration Management Database (CMDB) and content management systems, according to a recent blog post by vendor Effectual Systems. The vendor estimates that these systems contain between 50-75 percent junk data. Fixing it manually can add up quickly, even if you’re only dealing with 1,000 changes a month. In their example, that can cost IT $600,000 and 12,000 man-hours per year.\nIf you’d really like to pinpoint the cost of bad data at your own organization, Gartner’s Ted Friedman offers more specifics in this IT Business Edge interview, “How to Measure the Cost of Data Quality Problems.”\nLoraine Lawson is a veteran technology reporter and blogger. She currently writes the Integration blog for IT Business Edge, which covers all aspects of integration technology, including data governance and best practices.

{"id": "478", "text": "IBM Cuts Prices on Power 740 Storage and Smartie SSD and Servers\nDecember 6, 2010 Timothy Prickett Morgan\nIt looks like some customers are balking at the prices that IBM is trying to charge for storage chassis and a new solid state disk-PCI-Express RAID controller bundle that aims to boost the throughput of Power7-based machines.\nJust before the Thanksgiving holiday and just after I had already went to press with the prior issue of The Four Hundred, IBM said in announcement letter 310-295 that it was cutting the price on the feature 1135 integrated storage controller by 13.3 percent. This device is not a storage controller, but rather a 2U chassis with two dozen 300 GB disks that supports IBM i 6.1 or 7.1, as well as AIX or Linux. (The chassis does have integrated RAID controllers.) The price on that chassis, which comes populated with the disks, is now $32,441, or $4.51 per GB. The price was also cut on the Smart Analytics System SV2 model for the same chassis, which is built from Power 740 server nodes and which runs a collection of InfoSphere Warehouse, Cognos, and SPSS software to do business analytics processing. The Smartie machines are clusters based on x64, Power, and mainframe servers.\nSpeaking of the Smartie SV2 boxes, IBM also chopped the price of the PCI-RAID disk controller and solid state disk bundle used with this particular machine. I told you all about this bundle back in September, which pairs a PCI-Express 2.0 SAS controller with lots of bandwidth with four 177 GB SSDs made by SandForce for a total of 708 GB of storage and 120,000 I/Os per second of performance. IBM has a low-profile feature 2053 bundle for Power 710, 720, 730, and 740 servers that costs $20,654 and a regular-height version that costs $27,052. When IBM announced this back in September, knowing the costs were very high for SSDs, the company offered a package of that put together five of these controller/SSD bundles together for a 27.5 percent discount. Well, the Smartie box customers apparently said they wanted this price for onesies, and now IBM is selling single-units of these bundles on the Power 740-based Smartie SV2 clusters at the discounted price. That works out to $14,981 a pop, or $21.16 per GB, as you can see from this table:\nYou’ve known me a long time now, so what I am going to say next? Right! If customers buying Smartie boxes are getting the deal on onesies of the RAID/SSD bundle, then all customers regardless of platform should be getting that price. And it shouldn’t matter if they are getting the low-profile version or the regular version–the price should be the same.\nIBM also announced that the Power 740 server nodes used in the Smartie SV2 box, which have two processors with a total of 16 3.55 GHz Power7 cores activated and 128 GB of memory, had their prices slashed by a stunning 30.4 percent, from $72,828 to $50,708. So what am I going to say here? Right again! A Power 750 running IBM i 7.1 is a smart system too and it is a preconfigured box too, and that means if you acquire one using those very expensive eight-core Power7 chips spinning at 3.55 GHz, then you deserve a wonking 30.4 percent discount before the negotiations even start, too.", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}
{"id": "480", "text": "The journey of selling a home can be a rollercoaster of emotions and expectations. When your home remains on the market for an extended period without attracting offers, it can be frustrating. Here, we look into the main reasons why homes don’t sell and offer comprehensive solutions.\n1. The Pitfalls of Overpricing Your Property\nSetting the Right Price from the Start\nOverpricing is, without question, the leading cause behind homes not selling. When a home enters the market with an inflated price tag, it immediately faces numerous challenges:\n- Buyer Deterrence: A price significantly above the market average can deter potential buyers from even considering the property.\n- Lack of Competitive Edge: In the real estate market, your property competes against others in its category. An overpriced home lacks the competitive edge necessary to stand out.\n- Financing Hiccups: Even if a buyer agrees to the high asking price, financing issues may arise. Lenders often hesitate to approve mortgages for properties priced above their appraised value.\nHow We Address Pricing Challenges\nTo sidestep the pitfalls of overpricing, we leverage Comparative Market Analysis (CMA). This analytical tool helps us evaluate how your home compares to similar ones in the vicinity.\nBy understanding the local market dynamics and the price points of recently sold homes, we position our offer for your property competitively.\n2. Enhancing the Appeal of Your Home\nFirst Impressions Matter\nIn the property market, first impressions significantly influence buyer decisions. A well-maintained home resonates with potential buyers, signaling minimal future maintenance.\nSimple Home Upgrades with Big Returns:\n- Fresh Paint: A fresh coat of paint rejuvenates a home’s interior and exterior, offering a clean slate to prospective buyers.\n- Flooring: Flooring impacts the overall aesthetic of a space. Ensure all flooring, whether carpet, hardwood, or tile, is in prime condition. If it’s worn out, consider a refurbishment or replacement.\nBuyer’s Perspective: Ready to Move In\nWhen buyers view a home, they envision their future in it. Properties that appear move-in ready are often more enticing. By ensuring all repairs are done, and the home looks presentable, we increase the likelihood of capturing buyer interest.\n3. Energizing Your Marketing Strategy\nIn the digital age, a dynamic marketing strategy is pivotal. Traditional methods like yard signs and MLS listings, though foundational, are no longer enough.\nStrengthening Digital Presence:\n- Online Listings: We ensure your property is prominently featured across prominent real estate platforms and websites.\n- Interactive Tours: Incorporating virtual and 3D tours allow potential buyers to experience the property from the comfort of their homes.\n- Engaging Content: High-quality photos and engaging descriptions provide a comprehensive view of your property, attracting more potential buyers.\n4. Ensuring Seamless Property Access\nBoosting Home Showings through Accessibility\nAccessibility is critical. When real estate agents have easy access to your property, it increases the chances of frequent, even spur-of-the-moment showings.\n- Lockboxes: These secure devices store your home’s key, allowing verified agents to access and show your property even in your absence. Homes with lockboxes often receive more viewings.\n- Flexible Viewing Hours: Broadening the time slots for property viewings can accommodate a larger pool of potential buyers.\nSelling a home is a strategic process that requires meticulous planning and execution. We at Iwillbuyyourhouseforcash.com are dedicated to providing tailored solutions, ensuring your property stands out in the market and attracts the right buyers.\nWith our expertise and commitment, we aim to facilitate a swift and profitable sale for your home.

I can understand why some would want to ban this kind of literature from schools.\nHowever, being a white privileged woman, reading this only helped to make me understand yet another layer of historical prejudices and make me feel—truly feel—how horrible human nature can be.\nI was so heartbroken to be reminded about how the trial against Tom Robinson, a black man falsely accused of rape, ended. I cringed every time the “n” word was said, and the ignorant comments made by white society.

{"id": "489", "text": "After being exiled, Rabbi Levi Yitzchak and Rebbetzin Chana’s first home in the village of Chi’ili, Kazakhstan, was a single room in the dwelling of a crude Tartar couple who had a young child. The room had no door and was damp, muddy, and filled with swarms of mosquitoes. They lived in extreme poverty and discomfort, with no privacy. Though they never discussed it, pangs of hunger tormented them. Once, they did not taste a piece of bread for an entire month.\nWith World War II ravaging Europe, many refugees and displaced people ended up in the region where Rabbi Levi Yitzchak had been exiled. Rabbi Levi Yitzchak soon became well known among the Jewish refugees. Large groups of men and women, especially those women whose husbands were taken away for the war effort, would visit the esteemed rabbi and his wife, seeking counsel on various matters.\nWith meager resources at their disposal, and facing a constant threat to their very lives, Rabbi Levi Yitzchak and Rebbetzin Chana heroically reached out to their brethren in need, helping in every way, materially and spiritually.\nIn 1944, as Rabbi Levi Yitzchak’s sentence was nearing its end, his physical condition began to deteriorate. A serious illness was severely weakening him. Meanwhile, friends in nearby Alma Ata resolved to secure the rabbi’s release. They contributed thousands of rubles, giving of most of their wealth, to acquire proper permits for his relocation. After six weeks fraught with setbacks and obstacles, they were finally able to obtain the release documents. Immediately after Pesach, Rabbi Levi Yitzchak and Rebbetzin Chana left Chi’ili and arrived in Alma Ata. In this large city, their living conditions improved and they worked more vigorously to help others in need. Yet through the summer the Rabbi’s illness grew worse. A young friend made a special trip from Leningrad to Alma Ata, together with a well-known doctor. The doctor did not have a good prognosis for the rabbi.\nRabbi Levi Yitzchak and Rebbetzin Chana endured those heartbreaking days with exceptional strength and fortitude. Despite the dire conditions, they continued to welcome any depressed or broken person into their home, attending to his or her specific needs and providing food when necessary.\nOn the 20th of Av, Rabbi Levi Yitzchok’s condition turned critical. Although he was no longer able to speak, he continued to murmur words of Torah or Psalms. That evening, Rebbetzin Chana took a short rest so that she would have the strength to continue caring for him; when she awoke, she found the house filled with people. Her husband had returned his pure soul to its Maker.\nDuring his years as Rabbi of Yekatrinoslav, as well as while in exile in Chi’ili, Rabbi Levi Yitzchak wrote thousands of manuscripts of Torah encompassing and intertwining, in his unique style, Talmud, halacha, Kabbalah, and Chassidus.\nUnfortunately, most of these manuscripts were destroyed by the Communists and the Nazis. However, when Rebbetzin Chana escaped Russia in 1947, she managed to smuggle out some of the manuscripts that Rabbi Levi Yitzchak had written during his years of exile.\nAt the behest of the Rebbe, these manuscripts were published in a five-volume set under the title Likutei Levi Yitzchak. In his father’s memory, the Rebbe would also explain a passage of these Kabbalistic teachings at many of his Shabbat farbrengens.\nTo this day, Likutei Levi Yitzchok remains one of the most unique works on Kabbalistic thought from the last century.\nIt is now the custom of hundreds of chassidim, from all over the world, to be in Alma Ata for Chof (20) Menachem Av.

{"id": "494", "text": "Kawa Akrawi – Director\nKawa Akrawi is a Kurdish filmmaker who has been committed to documenting social justice issues through film since 1995. After the fall of Saddam Hussein, Kawa co-produced and directed two powerful documentaries, \"Saddam's Mass Grave\" and \"Chemical Ali\", which were filmed during his extensive travels through Iraq. \"Saddam's Mass Grave\" premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival in New York, earning critical acclaim for its raw and unflinching portrayal of the horrors committed by the Baath regime.\nKawa's more recent documentaries, including \"Kuljo: My Heart is Bleeding\" and \"One Yazidi Family vs ISIS,\" have been broadcast worldwide on BBC World and Al Jazeera. As a field director and D.O.P, Kawa brings his unique perspective and empathy to these projects, capturing the struggles and resilience of marginalised communities in Iraq with great sensitivity and depth.\nGulan Akrawi – Producer\nGulan is a Kurdish journalist and TV producer with a remarkable career in promoting Kurdish culture and media. She gained recognition as the head of the cultural center HYS in Turkey, where she worked for many years before moving to Belgium to work at the Kurdish TV station STV, where she now serves as the head of broadcast. For over a decade, she has collaborated with filmmaker Kawa Akrawi on several documentary projects that highlight the experiences of the Kurdish people. These projects cover a broad range of topics such as Kurdish history, politics, and culture.\nMaking The FilmAfter completing a film about a Yazidi family fleeing from ISIS massacres in Iraq in 2014, I felt a strong urge to investigate the roots of ISIS and understand the reason behind this Islamic jihadi group's hatred towards humanity. This journey took me to Rojava, a region in Northeastern Syria, where I visited the areas ISIS controlled and talked with detained ISIS fighters, their families and the local people. Here I realised that the ideology of this horrific movement is still alive and that this terror group was not operating alone.\nDespite facing numerous challenges and constantly moving for security reasons, we were determined to shed light on the critical situation in Syria through this film. I want the viewers to see what is happening here and why they should be concerned about a region that may seem far from their doorsteps. For example, one particular scene that stood out during our filming was our visit to the Al Hol camp, where we witnessed the devastating effects of the conflict on innocent children. We were disturbed to hear children of European parents singing Islamist fight songs that glorified death and violence. It was a stark reminder of the far-reaching impact of the conflict in Syria and the urgent need for international co-operation to find a solution.\nCrucially, many people abroad may not be aware of the extent of Turkish intervention in the region. Turkish military drones are active in the sky of Northeastern Syria, and they are not targeting the Islamic jihadi terror fighters but rather innocent civilians and vital infrastructure.\nThe situation in Syria is complex and volatile, and it is essential to understand the roots of the conflict and the various actors involved. Through this film, we aimed to provide a platform for the voices of those affected by the conflict and to encourage Western countries to engage in finding a solution.\n– Kawa Akrawi, Director", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}
{"id": "495", "text": "“Don’t worry, your time is coming…keep praying, keep preparing, keep planning.” These words stood out to me as I half-heartingly scrolled through the plethora of emails in my inbox. I read the words a few times, hoping they would be infused into my spirit and mind, as there seems to be a continual raging war between those two things within me as of late.\nWhen the season is daunting and you want to give up, or in my case, want to ignore the vision that lacks recent confirmation. God allows something as simple as a few words to show up in my inbox to penetrate the dormancy of the vision as a reminder to keep going, and a nudge to keep hope alive. My faith challenges me to believe it’s a love tap from the Lord that lets me know He’s not finished yet, so I shouldn’t be either.\nKeep praying. The Bible has a lot to say about prayer. So, with confidence, you can be assured that praying is the preferred method of the Lord for us to reach Him. Prayer is the means that enlightens us to understand His ways and His Word. With that, I want to focus on prayers that were answered in the Bible. From the beginning of creation prayer has been in existence. Imagine, the vastness of God that He hears the prayers of His people. WOW! We can reach the Father’s ear and He is kind enough to reply to our words or tears. Yes, tears are wordless prayers.\nIn the Bible, we read of testimonies of answered prayers. In 2 Kings 20:1-6, Hezekiah was very sick, and the prophet Isaiah came to tell him, “Dude, with all due respect, you’re not gonna make it out of this sickness.” The King prayed by turning his face to the wall and reminding God of their relationship and how he was with him from the time of his youth. He asked God for additional life. God answered his prayer and gave Hezekiah another 15 years of life.\n1 Samuel 1 gives us another answered prayer testimony. This time, it was Hannah who was in despair and needed hope. She was childless and her “sister wife” wasn’t. Apparently, the other wife seemed to find great pleasure in rubbing Hannah’s empty womb in her face. Yet, Hannah continued to be faithful to the Lord be going up to the house of the Lord yearly. Fast forward, God heard her tears and answered her prayers to have a child. God is a prayer answering God! Always keep praying.\nIf you’re vision isn’t happening, it appears your prayers aren’t being answered, and your faith is wobbly, keep praying. I'd like to share with you that I think praying puts you in a position for God to answer your needs, desires, dreams and so much more. So keep praying.\nBack to the original email that sparked this blog. It read keep praying and keep preparing. I take this to encourage and instruct me in the middle of the nothingness, I’m not to get lazy and do nothing. In the “it’s not happening” of the vision, that’s when you prepare even more than if something was happening. Think about it, when things do start happening, you won’t have time to prepare, and you’ll be unprepared. So, thank God for the time to prepare. It’s difficult and counterculture to prepare for something when nothing is happening. But that’s faith in action!\nIt's in the no movement that you’ll need to be creative and innovative in your preparing to stay motivated in your preparing. But preparing yourself will benefit you when it’s time! Being prepared allows you to fully engage in the arrival and ride of the wave when it happens.\nThe third directive listed in the email to keep your vision and passion alive is to keep planning. Planning is different from preparing. Preparing is conditioning so that you are ready. Planning is action. What you will do when it happens, what’s next, step by step. Your preparation will impact your plan and vice versa. While these two things are distantly related, they are unique in their impact.\nThis last directive is one that I added to help myself. Keep pressing! Pressing is left up to one’s own interpretation and one’s own capacity. My most committed pressing might be mild in your scope of pressing or vice versa. So, figure out how you press and to what capacity in your own life.\nPressing denotes consistent work and effort. Press on! Keep going! Keep the work moving. In Luke 8 and in Mark 5, we read of the woman who kept pressing. She had a debilitating condition and she heard about Dr Jesus! Due to the culture of that time, her condition hindered her from having a normal life. Despite, she pressed! She pressed through the crowd to get to Jesus. Not even to see Jesus’ face but to get close to his feet, specifically the hem of his clothing. Her pressing involved groundwork. She pressed until she got behind Jesus in the crowd confident that her contact with Him would be all she needed. Jesus answered her prayer. Her pressing paid off. Interestingly, I don’t know her name, as she was only referred to as the woman with the issue of blood, but she pressed, and Jesus answered her prayers.\nToday, keep praying. Today, keep preparing. Today, keep planning. Today, keep pressing. Just for today. Then if the Lord wakes you up tomorrow, repeat until it’s your glory time and you are seeing Jesus, face to face!\nJeremiah 29:11 For I know the plans I have for you, declares the Lord, plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future.", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

{"id": "504", "text": "The new documentary “On the Record,” available on HBO Max, explores multiple rape allegations against music mogul Russell Simmons.\nMuch of the film centers around Drew Dixon, one of the first women to go public with such allegations. In 1995, when Dixon was 24, she thought she had landed her dream job at Simmons’ record label Def Jam.\nOne night, she says, Simmons lured her to his apartment, supposedly to listen to a CD of a new artist. Instead, she says, he raped her.\nThe film shows Dixon as she debates whether to go on the record with her allegations against Simmons, as she ultimately did in the New York Times in late 2017.\n“On the Record” also features the accounts of several other women, including writer and domestic violence activist Sil Lai Abrams. (The Business host Kim Masters wrote about Abrams’ rape allegation against Simmons for The Hollywood Reporter.)\nSimmons, who denies wrongdoing, has sold off his businesses and moved to Bali — which does not have an extradition treaty with the U.S.\nThe directors of “On the Record” are Amy Ziering and Kirby Dick, veteran filmmakers who have tackled sexual assault in their documentaries “The Invisible War” and “The Hunting Ground.”\nFor much of the time they spent making “On the Record,” Dick and Ziering thought they had secured the backing of Oprah Winfrey, who had agreed to be an executive producer on the film and secured them a deal with Apple.\nZiering and Dick say they worked in close collaboration with Oprah, sending her cuts along the way and getting her enthusiastic approval of a rough cut in June 2019.\nBut on January 10, just days before “On the Record” was set to debut at Sundance, Oprah withdrew her support, saying she wanted the film pulled from the festival because it needed revisions.\nThe filmmakers say they still don’t know exactly what led Oprah to pull out. And they say she informed them of her decision in an email that they received just 20 minutes before she went public.\nOprah has maintained that she believes the women in the film. Her statement when she dropped out partly said that the film needed more work “to illuminate the full scope of what the victims endured.”\nDick and Ziering describe the shock of that setback and explain why they decided to go to Sundance anyway, where their film was greeted with multiple standing ovations and found a new home at HBO Max.", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

{"id": "510", "text": "The colors selected by the artists had a direct bearing on the characters portrayed. According to ancient texts, there are three broad qualities assigned to superhuman, human, and sub-human beings, viz. Satva (the noblest), Rajas (the active and middle principle) and Tamas (the dark and destructive principle) respectively.\nTo represent Satvic quality, green and shades of green were used. Characters of the Rajasic quality were portrayed in red or golden, and the Tamasic nature of the gods were represented not by black but in white, while demons and demonesses were represented by black.\nAmong the subjects, Vishnu and his Satvic incarnations, Parvati, Sridevi, Arjuna, pious beings like Prahlada and Markandeya were always painted in green. Bhoodevi (Goddess Earth), Ganga, Ganesa, and the four-headed Brahma were [typically] painted in red. Vishnu was [also] painted in different colors according to his attributes.\nIt is true that the figures of the murals have the external likeness of men and women; but the divine, or the supra-human aspect is also obvious in [virtually] every detail. The creators of these pictures had no doubt undergone rigorous mental disciplines, or sadhana.\nThey had the creative skill to fill every available space with as many details as possible, and also the skill to pinpoint one or two essential details and leave the rest to our imagination. The painting in the Mattancherry palace of Krishna holding the Govardhana aloft for example, is a typical example in which minute details of the wooded mountain are elaborately depicted. This tendency to detailed elaboration is also a characteristic feature of the Koodiyattom, the ancient temple theatre of Kerala. Another later, but frequent characteristic of the murals of Kerala are the beaded or decorative outlines, not only around each panel but also around individual figures.\nDuring the 15th and the 16th centuries, when the Bhakti movement swept through Kerala, many were the excellent murals that were painted. It is also highly probable that the leading names of the movement like the eighteen and a half poets of the Zamorins court, Ezhutachan, Melpathoor, Poonthanam, and the venerable sage Vilvamangalam could have been instrumental in reviving this popular tradition of religious art.\nThe decay of this tradition that started in the late 18th century, gained momentum with the Mysore invasion of Malabar (1766-82) and the take-over of the Travancore temple trusts by the then British Resident (1811). The final blow came when the portrait style of painting of Raja Ravi Varma (1848 1906) gained fame and popularity.", "scores": {"score": 3, "score_transform_1": 5, "score_transform_2": 5, "score_transform_3": 0}}

{"id": "515", "text": "Have you recently had a new furnace set up and are now having an unusual smell? You’re not alone, because plenty of other homeowners also have this happen at first. Let’s review what’s leading to this smell, and when you can anticipate it to go away, as well as three other furnace smells you shouldn’t disregard.\nWhy Your New Furnace Smells\nThere are two explanations why a new furnace might reek.\nYour furnace has a special coating on certain parts to keep them from rusting. This may include the heat exchanger, which safely removes gases such as carbon monoxide naturally created during the heating process.\nWhen your furnace operates for the first couple of times, the coating may release a burning smell. This is normal and the smell should dissipate the more your furnace heats.\nTo be on the safe side, you’ll want to call a heating and cooling company if the smell lingers. A burning smell that lingers can mean the motor is too hot or there’s an electrical problem, among other issues.\nDust accumulates inside your furnace when it’s idle in warm weather. That dust will burn off when you turn on your furnace in the fall, producing a burning smell. This smell should go away within a few minutes.\nOne way you can reduce or prevent this smell is by having furnace maintenance done every single year. This is necessary to keep your valuable manufacturer’s warranty valid, plus it keeps your furnace clean and ensures it will run smoothly during the upcoming heating season.\n3 Other Furnace Smells You Shouldn’t Disregard\nWhile it’s less common for a new system to need furnace repair, it happens. Here are three other odors you should keep an eye out for and what they might mean.\n- Burning plastic or rubber. If your furnace smells like burning plastic, you might have an electrical difficulties. Electrical wiring is coated in plastic to avoid shocks, and this smell is a signal that heat is melting this precautionary coating. To prevent a fire, turn off your furnace as soon as possible and have it checked out by an HVAC technician.\n- Gas or rotten eggs. Gas companies include sulfur in natural gas to signal you when there’s a leakage. If your furnace smells like gas or rotten eggs, shut it off right away, leave your home and call 911. Exposure to natural gas can make you ill, plus it’s highly flammable and explosive.\n- Musty. If your furnace smells musty, you might have mold and mildew developing in your ductwork. We advise having your ductwork inspected and cleaned if necessary.\nNow that you understand which furnace smells are normal and which ones aren’t, you’re well-equipped to take care of your new heating system. If you’re worried about an odd odor, our Kirkfield Heating & Air Conditioning HVAC technicians can assist you. Give us a call at 204-272-8128 to schedule your appointment now.

{"id": "533", "text": "Dodgers’ Clayton Kershaw will start NLCS Game 4 against Braves\nDodgers left-hander Clayton Kershaw, scratched from his scheduled Game 2 start because of back spasms, will start Game 4 against the Atlanta Braves on Thursday, manager Dave Roberts announced after Game 3 Wednesday night.\nKershaw’s back issue flared up after Saturday’s bullpen workout and forced the Dodgers to start Tony Gonsolin in Game 2—an 8-7 loss to the Braves—on Tuesday. Kershaw had “a pretty aggressive” bullpen workout before Tuesday’s game in Globe Life Field and received treatment Wednesday.\n“He was letting [the ball] go, and he came out of it great,” Roberts said before Game 3. “Every day it’s been better. … I talked to him briefly [Wednesday]. He’s in a good head space. I just know that we’re in a better place than we were [on Tuesday]. What that means, I don’t know quite yet.”\nKershaw threw eight shutout innings, allowing three hits, striking out 13 and walking one, in a 3-0 win over Milwaukee in Game 2 of the wild-card series on Oct. 1. He allowed three runs and six hits, struck out six and walked none in six innings of a 6-5 win over San Diego in Game 2 of the division series on Oct. 7.\nThe Dodgers use a record, 11-run first-inning scoring frenzy to rout the Atlanta Braves 15-3 in Game 3 of the NLCS.\nRoberts said he does not expect Kershaw’s start to be shortened in any way.\n“My expectation is that he’s going to go out there and make a start and help us win a ballgame,” Roberts said.\nKershaw’s return will allow the Dodgers to start Dustin May in Game 5 and Walker Buehler in Game 6 if necessary. If the series goes seven games, Tony Gonsolin would be available to start the finale on regular rest.\nBryse Wilson will start Game 4 for Atlanta, marking the sixth time in nine games the Braves will start a rookie pitcher this postseason. The 22-year-old right-hander spent most of 2020 at the team’s alternate training site. He went 1-0 with a 4.02 ERA in six big league games, two of them starts.\nAsked whether he could have imagined over the summer that he’d be starting Game 4 of the NLCS, Wilson said, “Uh … no, not in a million years. Obviously, this is a goal of mine. For it to actually be coming true. I’m just super thankful.”\nWilson, a Hillsborough, N.C., native who was a fourth-round pick out of high school in 2016, mixes a two-seam sinking fastball that averages 94 mph with a slider (88.8 mph), changeup (87.1 mph) and an occasional curve (78.8 mph).\nThe Dodgers tore up the MLB record book with their 11-run first inning and 15-0 start in Game 3 of the NLCS against the Atlanta Braves.\n“I really liked what I saw his last few starts,” Braves manager Brian Snitker said. “He’s starting to take a step forward and figure things out. I liked how he attacked guys and used his fastball.”\nWilson threw a six-inning, 88-pitch simulated game last Friday after Atlanta’s division series sweep of Miami, so he’s “ready to go as long as the team needs me to,” he said. Wilson will be the third straight rookie to start in the NLCS, following Ian Anderson in Game 2 and Kyle Wright in Game 3.\n“You watch video and you just have to kind of go as the game goes,” Dodgers right fielder Mookie Betts said. “You’ve never faced them, so there’s no way to calibrate how it comes out of his hand and what his pitches look like. But it is what it is. It’s new for him. It’s new for us.”\nSeager, Trout named Hank Aaron Award finalists\nDodgers shortstop Corey Seager and Angels center fielder Mike Trout on Wednesday were named two of 14 finalists for the Hank Aaron Award, which is given each year to the best offensive player in each league.\nSeager led the Dodgers in RBIs (41), tied for the team lead in average (.307) and was second on the team in OPS (.943). The performance was one of the best of his career. But it remains to be seen if he did enough to rival National League batting champion Juan Soto, who hit .351 with an MLB-best 1.185 OPS.\nTrout won the Hank Aaron Award in 2019, a few weeks before being named American League MVP for the third time. A repeat in 2020 might be difficult. He batted .281 with a .993 OPS. He didn’t lead the American League in any notable offensive categories — though he did finish tied for third in home runs with 17.\nFans will decide the fates of Trout and Seager. Ballots for the award can be cast online at MLB.com/hankaaronaward.\nTrout was also nominated by his peers for the outstanding player award in the AL. Betts received the same honor in the National League. Freddie Freeman, Juan Soto, José Abreu and DJ LeMahieu are the other finalists.

{"id": "535", "text": "How the ‘Great Resignation’ will impact those in-house\nThe supposed mass exodus of professionals from their jobs in the coming months will likely impact upon law. What will happen in the corporate legal space?\nThe ‘Great Resignation’\nTo continue reading the rest of this article, please log in.\nCreate free account to get unlimited news articles and more!\nEarlier this month, Lawyers Weekly reported on the likelihood of a “Great Resignation” in Australia’s legal profession, following research from tech giant Microsoft revealing that over 40 per cent of the global workforce is actively considering leaving their employers.\nAs Keypoint Law CEO Warren Kalinko noted, there will be “pent up demand” for change from lawyers of all stripes, especially now that the nation’s major cities are emerging from extended lockdowns.\nLegal People partner Sharon Henderson added: “I am hearing from many [candidates] that they are burned out in their current role and set to start looking once 2021 is over.”\nMoreover, Burgess Paluch Legal Recruitment director Paul Burgess noted, “low-interest rates, strong demand for employment and an economy highly supported by government COVID-19 support could be providing fuel for a storm once restrictions are eased in the major employment markets of Melbourne and Sydney”.\nIt is critical to consider whether this “Great Resignation” will come for those in-house, as it appears it will for those in private practice.\nAs Winc group general counsel and company secretary Troy Swan puts it, highly skilled and talented lawyers are in demand and highly employable and transferable.\n“They stay in roles not because they need to, but because they want to,” he warned.\nThis means that law department leaders must create an environment that resonates with a team and “not only meets all their basic hierarchy needs but goes above and beyond to create a special environment and be an employer of choice”.\nIs it coming in-house?\nLawyers Weekly spoke with four general counsel to examine the extent to which law department leaders anticipate such a wave of turnover in-house.\nFor Mr Swan, it “seems real”.\n“This trend serves as a timely reminder of the importance of ensuring our teams are being well recognised, well rewarded, provided with opportunities and increasingly given the ability to work on things that matter,” he proclaimed.\n“There are increasing examples across many industries of people reassessing their values and opportunities as a result of the pandemic. Any material IP loss is a risk to any business and function, particularly a loss of that knowledge within a legal team which poses an even bigger risk.”\nFreelance general counsel and legal influencer Anna Lozynski notes that if the “Great Resignation” is happening across business industries, one has to presume it will also affect the legal profession.\n“I know that I have witnessed an influx of in-house roles hit the market at a rate not seen before. The pandemic has served as a wake-up call for many departments, workplaces and, of course, individuals across many levels,” she said.\nNaturally, she submitted, the workplace needs to evolve.\n“The pandemic has facilitated us having deeper conversations with team members, beyond mere career aspirations and job-related tasks. While resignations are not always convenient and easy to accept, for the most part, they create opportunities for fresh thinking, and new hires inject a new energy into the team.”\nWiseTech Global general counsel Katrina Johnson noted that she “observed very much attrition or movement taking place in the in-house legal community, particularly among tech companies”, which she puts down to employees having placed a “much higher premium than ever before on flexible and individually tailored working arrangements, and this mode of working generally tends to align more closely with in-house legal environments compared with law firms”.\n“For example, many in-house legal teams had already adopted flexible, remote and hybrid working models as part of their business-as-usual operations prior to the pandemic, and our employer organisations likely have had more experience than law firms when it comes to managing and responding to the needs of more diverse employee populations,” she said.\nThese factors, she surmised, might provide in-house legal departments with some advantage over their private practice counterparts when it comes to meeting emerging and shifting requirements for employee preferences.\n“That said, in-house leaders certainly can’t afford to be complacent, and I think they should always be actively focused on attraction and retention of talent,” Ms Johnson added.\nTelstra general counsel Craig Emery suspected we might see a mixture of resignations, transitions and migration – the latter of which will be especially relevant, “as the days of where you work dictating where you live rapidly dwindle”.\n“If you don’t have a strong employee value proposition, and if you don’t have a strong bias to flexibility, you’d perhaps be right to be concerned,” he warned.\nMore flexibility needed\nMr Emery does not believe that the age of coronavirus has dramatically altered what in-house lawyers value in their roles.\n“People want a place where they feel valued, see purpose and meaning in their work, can grow their skills, are fairly compensated and rewarded, and have work-life balance,” he mused.\nWhat the last 18 months have brought into sharp relief, however, is the elevated need for flexibility, he said.\n“People have experienced what it is like to work full-time from home. Some will want to make this their predominant ‘way’ of working, using the office rarely, if at all. I’ve heard it said that flexibility used to be a differentiator, but COVID-19 has now meant it is standard across the board.\n“Personally, I think time will tell if that is true.\n“I believe those companies that maintain complete flexibility, and don’t resort back to being in the office as standard, with working from home acceptable only on occasion, will have an edge in terms of both recruiting and retaining talent.”\nMs Lozynski agreed, saying that law department leaders must allow for flexibility “in droves”.\n“Working remotely or in a hybrid fashion requires greater accessibility of leaders, organising things differently and more consciously. If communication is not a team strength, then that’s a good one to address and transform, ensuring it’s a mix of 1:1 time and team connection,” she argued.\n“As humans, who also happen to be lawyers, we want to be seen, heard and valued. That means there is no ‘one size fits all’, but rather a customised approach for each staff member – that’s a direct contradiction to ‘company culture’ as we have known it.”\nFor example, Ms Lozynski pointed out, employees with the ages of 18 and 25 reported in Microsoft’s research that they were more likely to struggle balancing work with life (+8 percentage points) and to feel exhausted after a typical day of work (+8 percentage points) when compared to older generations.\n“For Gen Z’s, feeling a sense of purpose and connection is essential to feel satisfied at work, but remote work makes this more challenging, especially for those new to the workforce,” she said.\nBetter workplace culture and wellness support\nMoreover, Mr Swan said, legal leaders should “always be mindful” of the culture and environment they are creating.\n“Building purpose-driven, highly capably tight teams that understand the business, have the relevant relationships and matching skill sets and importantly can navigate an organisation to help the business achieve its desired outcome, does not happen overnight,” he outlined.\n“It is generally the result of many interactions and building relationships during times of difficulty when parties are forced to work together to achieve a common outcome.\n“Trust is built during war,” Mr Swan went on.\n“Members of a legal team are generally some of the most important across an organisation because of the knowledge and value they bring to a problem and the business. We need to create an environment where people actively want to be part of the team and want to come to work.\n“This means team members must be well rewarded and recognised for their work and must be given opportunities to explore their own areas of interest within the requirements of the business.”\nThis also means, Ms Johnson said in support, being more focused on idiosyncratic wellness needs and then being responsive to those idiosyncrasies of individual team members.\nI believe that legal leaders should be more focused than ever on the wellbeing and engagement of their teams and in doing what they can to be responsive to the needs of individual team members.\n“We’ve all asked a lot of our people over an extended and challenging period, and we owe it to them and to our teams to ensure we’re focused on their satisfaction and retention. I think it is important to start by asking your team members what they need (rather than assuming what that is) and actively seeking their suggestions as to the types of support you can provide that would be most helpful to them,” she advised.\n“Not everyone will have the same needs, and a ‘one size fits all’ approach won’t work. Leaders shouldn’t presume to know what each of their team members will need at any particular point in time, but should instead be conscious that needs will continue to shift over time.”\nTherefore, Ms Johnson continued, it is important for leaders to keep checking in with their team members and actively soliciting their feedback while also ensuring they are responsive to and action that feedback.\n“Some other ways that leaders can demonstrate tangible support range from small things like asking team members to take their 1:1s or team calls while out on a walk (so that you deliberately prompt them to take a break and get out of their home working environment) through to providing ‘bonus’ days of additional leave as a thank you, and prioritising investment in their learning and development.”\nOpportunities for in-house leaders\nThis all said, the coming months present myriad chances for employers to improve their value propositions for in-house counsel.\nMs Johnson: “Employee expectations are evolving, and I anticipate that lawyers will increasingly expect and seek out environments where they are afforded maximum flexibility and individualised support from leaders who are genuinely empathetic and caring, who encourage collaboration rather than competition within their teams, and who are actively responsive to the needs of their individual team members.\n“I think the servant model of leadership is also likely to become more common in future in response to these changes. In-house leaders who embrace these qualities will likely be well-placed to attract and retain talented individuals into the future.”\nFor Ms Lozynski, the key will be for leaders to continually adapt.\n“Experiment with new ways of connecting with staff. Keep communication high, at an individual level but also at a team level. Encourage staff to pursue their passions outside of work – side hustles, networking, seeking other qualifications,” she said.\n“Think outside of the box – is it possible to apply all or part of a learning and development budget not only towards pure work-related items but say on a yoga teacher training course or personal coaching if that’s going to serve that team member and develop them as a human (rather than purely as a lawyer on the job).”\nAnother option that must be considered, Ms Lozynski continued, is connecting with ALSP models and freelancers in the case of looming staff shortages.\n“Traditional law firms may not always have the resources to support secondments, and so it is important to have a varied network in place to call on when a resourcing need arises,” she identified.\nOrganisations that do not authentically value the contribution made by key members or their changing needs, Mr Swan advised, will ultimately see a negative impact on their performance.\n“This will provide opportunities for peer set organisations to access high performing people that may not otherwise be available or seeking a shift. The increasing war for talent, particularly in-house, is exacerbated as a result of global phenomena such as this, and reinforces the basics of teams and leadership and the value they create to an organisation,” he detailed.\nPerhaps just as important, Mr Emery suggested, will be the opportunity to evaluate one’s leadership and value proposition in the face of staff movement.\n“Where people do leave, seek to deeply understand why, and adjust accordingly. Equally, look to understand why people leave places other than yours, and reflect on whether you’re exposed in the same way.”", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

It’s not uncommon to feel uncertain and scared. Having the comforting hand of a competent provider lawyer to guide you will reduce stress, protect your rights and minimize negative impact on any children involved. For as little as $24.95/month, a LegalShield legal plan gets you access to a team of experienced lawyers, so you can resolve the issue correctly and legally, and move on with your life.\nYour personal legal plan allows you to contact your lawyer to get legal advice, letters and calls, document review and more for an unlimited number of personal legal matters related to family law.\nEven if your divorce is uncontested and relatively low drama, making long-term decisions should not be rushed or taken lightly.\nTo make good choices, it’s important to understand how the divorce process works, how long it takes and your rights and responsibilities. Divorce can require you to assemble financial information, file documents in the proper jurisdiction, negotiate with your spouse and a slew of other potentially overwhelming tasks. You don’t have to go it alone.\nWorking with a divorce lawyer that can answer questions, guide your decision making and help you prepare documents can make your life much easier. A LegalShield membership allows you to speak with a family law lawyer for a fraction of normal legal fees and they can relieve much of the burden by handling an uncontested divorce on your behalf.\nIf your divorce involves children, the stakes are high. Making sure child custody and child support are fair to both parties and represent the best interests of your children typically requires help from an impartial third party. For the sake of your kids, you need to get this right.\nAlso, modifying existing child support or child custody orders post divorce can cause anxiety. Rather than wrestling with confusing forms and getting into arguments with your former spouse, you can dramatically reduce your stress by having a family law lawyer handle the situation for you.\nWhatever your circumstances, having access to a LegalShield provider lawyer for child custody, child support, and related family matters can help you rest easier.\nAdopting a child can be one of the most rewarding and special steps a person can take. Trying to get through the paperwork and procedures, not so much.\nDeciding to change your or your child’s name is a big decision.\nEliminate all stressing and guessing by getting a LegalShield legal plan. For one small monthly fee you can have access to a provider lawyer to help with adoption, name change and more.\nFinding solutions to your legal issues doesn’t have to be stressful, complicated or expensive. LegalShield puts the power of legal representation within reach of any individual, family, or business. We work hard to make it easy, simple, and affordable to get the legal help you need, when you need it.\nInstead of paying a lawyer by the hour, you pay a small fee (starting at $24.95/month) and have access to an independent lawyer that will provide a huge variety of legal services without a huge legal bill. Services like consultation with a lawyer, document review, drafting of debt collection letters and defense at civil trials are included as standard benefits. Using the plan just once can save you literally thousands of dollars.\nUsing the plan is as simple as signing up and contacting our team. Once you’re a member, customer support will connect you with an independent lawyer in your area who specializes in the specific legal issue with which you need help. Also, you can download our super-simple app to quickly access your legal benefits and member perks anytime.\nYou can use your plan as soon as your membership application is reviewed and your account is set up. The review process takes 12-24 hours (or less) from the moment you purchase your plan (on regular business days). Once accepted, you can be in contact with a lawyer and begin to use the plan benefits and member perks outlined in the membership agreement right away.\nThe average lawyer in the U.S. charges between $150-$400 per hour. If you use your membership for even just a few hours a year you could easily save over $1,000. If you have a bunch of small legal issues or one rather complicated issue, you can easily save multiple thousands of dollars over hiring a lawyer directly. Not to mention the stress you’ll save by having a lawyer on call instead of trying to handle legal issues yourself. Also, the lawyers in our network often help our members recover thousands of dollars of damages or avoid thousands of dollars in fees over what they would have experienced had they tried to resolve the legal issue themselves. Obviously, every member and usage situation is different, but when used correctly, your membership can easily save significant amounts of money. Not to mention savings from our member perks.\nOur Personal Plan is really a family plan. You, your spouse or partner and your dependents living at home are covered under one membership.\nThere is more information about this on the personal plan coverage & pricing page.", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

{"id": "542", "text": "WHAT IT’S GOING TO TAKE, Part 2\nI need your forgiveness. It has been rightly said that whenever you put an adjective (a modifying word) in front of the word justice that justice no longer means justice. This is why ‘social justice’ actually distorts the word justice. Thus, because I am forced to entitle this second instalment, True Justice (so as to distinguish it from all of the other modified versions of justice), I must seek your forgiveness – but I hope that the content of what I am going to manifesto will compensate for my literary violence. In this second instalment of my manifesto for how our society can experience and enjoy the divine blessings of happiness, security, wellness, fulfilment, enlightenment, and prosperity, I am going to challenge those who are called to arena of justice to fulfil their calling just as I did for those called to politics and government in the first instalment.\nO LORD, You hear the desire of the afflicted;\nYou will strengthen their heart;\nYou will incline Your ear\nto do justice to the fatherless and the oppressed,\nso that man who is of the earth may strike terror no more.\nWHAT IS JUSTICE?\nJustice is primarily about what is right and true. It involves reasonable fairness based on what is right and true. (This is why we must be careful using the term social justice because it invariably involves positive unfairness.) Because it is grounded in what is right, it is unavoidably linked to the work of legislators who are responsible for codifying (writing in Law) what is right. This is why words matter. And this is why grammar matters (including pesky little things like commas and apostrophes which can inadvertently change the entire sentiment of a law).\nGive justice to the weak and the fatherless;\nmaintain the right of the afflicted and the destitute.\nThe Scriptures speak a lot about the need for those people of influence to defend those less fortunate from abuse and oppression. The need for justice is viewed in Scripture as especially needed for the vulnerable – widows, fatherless, disabled, and the destitute – who are most susceptible to have it denied to them. In the late 17th century in England, a person could be imprisoned for missing a repayment on a loan, or, even if it was only alleged (even falsely) that they had committed an offence, and there was no judicial process for them to get justice – and no release from their imprisonment – until they had paid the jailer for their time in remand. One of the reasons we should all thank God is for a legal right called Habeas Corpus which was introduced by the British Parliament in 1679, and has since been adopted by most western countries. It now means that someone cannot be imprisoned unless they have been charged with a crime and had their case heard in a court of law. Habeas Corpus is fundamentally grounded in a Christian worldview which regards all people as being equal under the law and entitled to reasonable justice. Sadly though, there are too many nations today where this is not the case and people can be held in prison – and even tortured – without being charged with an offence or the due process of having their day in court. Saudi Arabia is one of the worst such human rights abusers of any nation according to Amnesty International. Obviously they are not the only nation which do not recognise Habeas Corpus as a human right. China, Yemen, Syria, Iran, North Korea, Venezuela, Russia, and Turkey, each fail to provide reasonable justice to its citizens. Because I regard the unstoppable light of the Gospel through Spirit-empowered Christ-ambassadors to the transforming force for good in the world, I expect that eventually each of these nations will succumb to the message and influence of the Gospel and that they will subsequently embrace a Christian worldview in the justice systems. I therefore expect that there maybe teens reading this whom God has called from birth (they would have already become known for their keen sense of justice and concern for human rights globally) to become lawyers, or barristers, or attorneys, or judges, or justices, who will play a role on the international stage of diplomacy by using their trained legal minds to become the agents of such national transformations.\nHow blessed are those who promote justice,\nand do what is right all the time!\nPsalm 106:3 NET\nWHY DOES JUSTICE MATTER?\nJustice matters for three important reasons. Firstly, it is the express will of God our Creator and an expression of His heart of love for all mankind. To promote true justice is to invoke God’s blessing (Psalm 106:3; 112:5). Secondly, it fulfils the second of God’s two great commandments for all people – to love your neighbour as yourself (Matt. 22:39). Thirdly, it becomes the framework for the Gospel to be understood and heightens men’s consciences to their unworthiness and need for a Saviour (Rom. 7:7).\nHave you sensed the call of God on your life to be a minister of justice? I’ve already mentioned lawyers and judges as ministers of justice, but there are also those who serve as police and in the military. In addition to these public service roles, there are other ways to minister which you may not be familiar with and while some of them are ‘front-line’, many are invaluable behind the scenes roles. For example –\nThe International Justice Mission – works to free slaves around the world by working with local law enforcement. IJM Officers are usually seconded from experienced ex-Police and Military personnel. They rely on public donations for their vital work. Did you know that there are more people in slavery today than at any other time in human history?\nCompassion Australia – is a Christian based organisation which is working to break the cycle of poverty in the Two-Thirds World. On their website they state, “Worldwide, 385 million children live in extreme poverty. Poverty robs children of their basic rights to learn, play and grow. In its ugliest form, poverty can lead to exploitation, child labour and even death. It’s unacceptable. That’s why our Child Sponsorship Program exists. Because more powerful than poverty is the hope of Jesus, the care of a local church and the encouragement of you: a loving sponsor.“\nWorld Vision is possibly the world’s largest child sponsorship ministry. In Australia, under the leadership of Claire Rogers, they have made a significant re-mission focus back toward being a Gospel support ministry.\nThe Alliance For Defending Freedom is based in the USA and has a team of attorneys who take up the legal cause of Christians who are being ill-treated because of their faith in Christ. There are moves afoot to launch a similar ministry in Australia.\nWHAT IT’S GOING TO TAKE\nFor those called into the frontlines of the judicial system as lawyers and barristers, and for some of you, as justices, your pathway necessarily involves you reading the classics and studying history, theology, English, philosophy and rhetoric – before you embark on your law degree studies. Chances are, that if God has already called you into the legal fraternity, you have already met practising lawyers and law students. Your road ahead is going to hard. It will require you to become highly self-disciplined and determined. You might be surprised how God will use you once you have qualified as a lawyer – it may not be in the courtroom where He will use you and your training!\nIn recent times in America, and in other countries, radical social change has taken place when just one unelected judge made a ruling that changed the law and thereby the course of history! We need lawyers and judges who fear the Lord and understand the Christian worldview is not about imposing religious ideas, but about upholding reasonable justice and th truth for all – especially the most vulnerable. For those of us, and that’s most of us, who are not called into the frontlines of administering and ensuring justice, we can play our part in three vital ways:\n1. At the ballot box – don’t waste your vote! If any political party or candidate promotes injustice (especially where the most vulnerable will be abused) do not vote for them! No political party or candidate is perfect, but whenever a party scandalously boasts about having a policy where they will fund the termination of a person’s life – whether it be a baby in the womb, or grand-parent in a nursing-home – do not vote for them!\n2. Over coffee – whether it be catching up with your girlfriends or mates, or even around the water-cooler at work, when injustice is innocently and ignorantly promoted in conversations, be prepared to offer a winsome, reasonable, correction. This might be in the form of two questions- “Do you believe the unjustified taking of an innocent human being’s life is wrong?” “Did you know that without exception, those who work in the field of Human Embryology all regard a foetus in a mother’s womb as a human being?”\n3. On your knees – those in the political and justice spheres often feel that the Christian community are not fully behind them – and often feel that many in the Church simply do not care about the big issues confronting our society. As someone who is frequently the beneficiary of other’s prayers, I well know the difference between having people praying for you and no-one praying for you. It is my desire to inspire and help many more Christ-followers into politics and law, and it is equally my desire to muster people who will pray for them to be strong in Christ and His Word, and filled with courage to do what is right.\nCan I count on you to do these three much needed things? If you are one of the few whom God has called into the sphere of Law, you are destined to play an important role in defending the rights of the vulnerable, and uphold the reasonableness of the Christian worldview. And this is a role we need more lawyers and justices who know the love of Christ to fulfil.", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

{"id": "548", "text": "You have no items in your cart. Want to get some nice things?Go shopping\nPromise yourself: If they catch you, you’ll deny it. Decide that you will play dumb. Practice seeming confused, insisting genuinely to an invisible supervisor that you were looking for a different file, one that you were asked to get. Realize while laying in bed after your fourth day of work that if you end up doing this, you should do it within the first month, so it’ll be more believable if you do get caught. Reach for your phone on the nightstand and look up Virginia state laws for accessing unauthorized medical records. Read about a podiatrist named Zhang Liu Jie. Wonder how you would do in prison for four months. Start Googling whether prisoners are allowed to have tampons. Fall asleep with the thought that probably you should just avoid it altogether.\nLate at night on Wednesday of your second week, spend hours flinging yourself into different but equally ineffective positions on your bed. Feel at least two itches on some part of your body at any given time. Become uncomfortably aware of your breathing for what feels like a solid hour. Open your eyes and stare up into the darkness. Make a face like you are looking at someone who has chosen intentionally to piss you off. Get up.\nHave a glass of wine at the kitchen table from a mostly-full bottle in the fridge. Have another. Take the bottle back to bed without a glass and finish it, knowing that this was what you planned the moment you got out of bed to open the fridge in the first place. Fall asleep around four or five in the morning. Wake up at your last alarm at 6:25am, absolutely still drunk. Put on a brown dress with a high collar that makes your neck itch. Don’t put on any makeup. Call a cab. Get to work and walk through the hallways staring at the floor. Try to focus your vision enough to see the thin silver lines that divide up a white speckled desert of linoleum tiles. Get to your desk.\nLean down over the side of your chair and squint to confirm that yes, the silver lines are there after all. Straighten up. Turn on your monitor. Listen to the quiet of the building, since you’re here actually rather early after not showering or putting on eye-shadow. Log in. Settle into the scratchy neck of your dress. Idly open the hospital mega-database network icon. Idly go through three more login screens. Peer doubtfully at a black line blinking at the beginning of a long white text bar.\nLook up a name.\nIf you type in “Mallory Dunn,” open a page with the correct birth year listed and let your eye wander down a table of dates and doctors and pronouncements of the body given in capital letters, strange abbreviations and unknown terms. Bounce off a few words that are staring out from the mass of black-on-beige text, each one like a hostile yet familiar face in the crowds of a foreign market. Like the assassin in a 50s movie you watched once in a dim hotel room. He painted himself orange as if it would disguise him among Moroccans, and chased the man who recognized him down alleyways to send him staggering out into the sunlight, a knife unreachable exactly in the center of his back. Realize just how drunk you still are.\nClick print for the one crowded page of the summarized file before you can think about how stupid that is. Rip it from the jaws of the printer. Stuff it dramatically in your bag. Spend all day sobering up and ruminating on horrors of the abdomen. Feel like each woman around you knows by heart a history that is only hers, the details of a long-term relationship, with first occurrences made into legends and knock-down drag-out fights and hard-won victories and silent burdens and the bitter pride of old battle scars. Find yourself stealing glances at shirt fronts: the blank wall of loose blue scrubs, a gentle suggestion of hill and belly-button through pink cotton, rolls of fat jiggling smoothly under a skin of teal jersey. Give up. Sit on the bus without your headphones and listen to your silent abdomen.\nOnce you get home, remember one Halloween that she spent talking to a tall man in a dapper black coat with a large, elegant nose. Cut out everything but the nose until she is talking up to a tired literary reference. For some unknown reason, go looking for the hat you wore that night. Find it in a downstairs closet at the bottom of a box of gloves, its cheap white fur faded grey, small round ears permanently crumpled. Put it on. Tie the sides under your chin. Sulk, and unknowingly do a pretty good impression of how you looked most of that Halloween. Have a flashback of explaining to the nose that you and a friend (who had left the party) were dressed as characters from a cartoon.\n“Is the character a bear? A small white bear?” he wondered.\n“No,” you said, “He’s a boy.”\n“Did you maybe put on the wrong costume?” ran the nose.\n“No, he’s just a boy who wears a hat with ears on it.” No one knew what you were.\nSit at your desk on Friday and repeat under your breath a Biggie Smalls lyric you can’t get out of your head, as you send out some tedious office-logistic-type emails. Sing it as, “I know my mother wished she got a fuckin’ smishmortion.” Tell yourself you’re singing it like that because it makes you laugh. Imagine you and her, still in love, walking to the zoo with a perfect three foot-by-two-foot shmishmorted Biggie. You are each holding one of his hands.\n“I’ll make your motherfuckin’ brain warm!” he sings happily as he swings between the two of you. Wonder how much attention that might attract on the streets of San Francisco. Plan to get the whole family discreet wide-brimmed hats. Wonder what the rent is like in her neighborhood. Look up on Google maps how far away the west coast is. Change the route to “Walking” and drop the little orange street-view man at the beginning of a 3,079 mile line stretched across America. Click “begin route.” Stare down a blurry, pixelated arbor of trees.\nIf you do not type “Mallory Dunn,” type “Louisa Gurman.” Know the exact date of birth because it is an annual source of guilt. Click the only possible file and skim through relatively bare sections until finally you get to a long list of ophthalmologists, the last one from a visit a few months ago, near her current listed address, in Maine. Scroll through a column of appointment dates aligned with a column of myopic prescription diopters that decline against each other in a pattern as exact and unchanging as the glide ratio of a crashing airplane. Stare dumbly at the staggering cost listed for the first two weeks of guide-animal training. Note that, at the very least, her astigmatism has still not shifted since she was fourteen.\nThe next day at work, walk past a woman wearing a thin tortoiseshell headband. Turn to look at it. Get an odd glance in return. Get to your desk and think suddenly of the smell of new paint and the cold draft from a window blowing directly onto your left side as your sister showed you her first pair of glasses, which were striped bright green and yellow, a child’s tortoiseshell, with bendable rubbery frames so they would not be broken by anyone as small as both of you. Remember a twenty-two-year-old miracle: being handed the glasses unprompted, her uttering, “Put them on.”\nLook up at her. Put them on wrong. Sit still when she tells you to, and try not to flinch away as she puts them on for you and then smooths your thin toddler hair out from under the ear hooks. Feel alien weight on your face and look out into twin basins of a warped and sharp-cornered world. Remember how precious and rare it was to be even in this madhouse version of her room. Stare at the space between your computer monitor and your keyboard, the whole world undone under a blur of wine and exhaustion. Picture blinky brown eyes behind increasingly thick glass. Push your tongue into the gap tooth you developed right after she got hers fixed. Wonder what her hair looks like now.\nHave a song stuck in your head. Get as far as, “I know my mother—” Put some headphones in and listen to the Talking Heads instead.\nRe-check her current address after lunch. Panic when you realize how close she could be to fleeing up into Canada. Picture a black stone house on a hill with a smoking chimney, half-buried in snow. Picture a polar bear creeping bare-toothed up the expansive white towards the house. Never quite realize that you have pictured a cartoon polar bear. Remember what she looked like wrapped up in winter garb, stamping deliberately out into a blizzard, curly hair flying from the sides of her hood. Feel nostalgia for a hard-fought childhood in Alberta together that never happened. Picture her aiming down the sight of a rifle. Make sure each movement is practiced. Keep her hands steady. Leave a squint ambiguously as either anger or concentration. Throw the arrangement of four black lines and a nose that is now the polar bear into an open roar. Place her finger on the trigger. Wait for her to fire. Wait.\nIn a box of junk from the last room you shared with her, find a photo that has slid sideways in a nickel frame of clunky filigree hearts, and immediately start crying. It is early-ish digital and the details are slightly grainy and wrong—in one spot the pixels have failed to delineate where an incisor disappears into an upper lip. Hold the frame in your lap like a crystal ball and look down into it. Witness your sister at seventeen leaning back against the rail of a boat, the bow cutting pure-white against waves a mess of every possible blue, the island of Crete like a painted tile behind her and her skin more deeply olive than it ever was with you and your parents at home. She is half-smiling. She is wearing a pair of dark sunglasses.\nWear real pajamas to bed that night. Spend the next day doing everything you’re supposed to do for your superiors. Get lunch with some nurses your age. Work in that office for seven years, and get pretty good at your job. Look up only the names of strangers, given to you by other people. Drink wine early enough in the evening that you are never drunk by morning. Befriend a cardiologist named Bill, and eventually name him as the godfather of your son. Never think about small rubber glasses, or a white boat off Crete, or the charging speed of a polar bear up an incline. Work on a computer all day. Never find yourself staring down an arbor of blurred trees. Never map a trail up to Maine.\nAnna Bernstein is an undergraduate student at Macalester College where she studies English and Arabic.

{"id": "551", "text": "My name is: Mahesh Natarajan.\nMy stomping ground is: Delhi, India, with all the hustle and bustle of a big Indian city. I’m lucky to be in a quieter neighborhood with large public parks providing a welcome break. And, as often as I can, I’m on property at Ananda, which is a four-hour drive or a 40-minute flight for some rest, reflection and healing.\nI’m known for being: I am the Chief Operating Officer for Ananda, one of the world’s most holistic wellness retreats, located in the Himalayas in India. Besides broader business responsibilities, I lead and am actively involved in our wellness programs, design, research and future growth.\nI’m talking about: Our Dhyana Meditation program, which is a deeply immersive approach that guides guests through pratyahara (withdrawal of the senses from the mind), dharana (focusing of the mental awareness) and awareness of the journey towards the experience of dhyana (continued meditative awareness).\nYou can find it at: Offered throughout the year at Ananda.\nBefore I started this mindfulness work, I was:\nMy career began in the early 90s as a luxury hotelier and then across several industries as a brand and marketing strategist. Now, for the last 15 years, Ananda’s healing journey and my own are reflective of mindfulness and emotional healing which is of critical need today.\nMy interest was sparked when:\nAs a holistic retreat, our approach has always been to arrive at a harmonious balance between mind, body and soul. Physical well-being is targeted through Ayurveda to balance each individual’s bio energies through therapy and food as a medicine. The energy or prana and mental well-being are addressed through a combination of traditional yoga, breathwork and meditation. But the beginnings of the idea to create a deeply immersive program came a few years ago when I started to see a significant shift in the needs of our guests. Most of our clients are living fast-paced lives as leaders of industry, as entrepreneurs and in the corporate world, but, increasingly, this success is not translating to a sense of balance and harmony. There was a need to explore a much more spiritual journey rather than just experience this at the surface. Following a traditional meditative mindful journey, personally mentored by yogis with a wealth of experience, and being able to bring this into one’s daily life, was the answer.\nHow it works is:\nThe various concepts of Dhyana (meditation) and its practice originated in the Vedic era and have been influenced over the ages by various schools of study including Buddhism and Hinduism. The practice of meditation is one of the key tools that helps harmonize the mind and also taps into the full potential of the higher mind. By overcoming negative tendencies, it helps harmonize the whole personality and gives an overall sense of calm.\nTopics related to the philosophy of yoga, the structures of the yogic system, the yogic and meditative lifestyle, the positive effects of mantras (sound vibrations) and self-study are discussed during these sessions. Daily personalized pranayama sessions promote breathing techniques that lead to control of pranas (energy) and the mind. Personalized yoga sessions focus on asanas accompanied by an awareness of one's energy. Soothing and healing therapies complement the mindful meditation and yoga sessions.\nWhat makes it different is:\nThe yogic system has referred to the mind not just as “mind,” but as the “mental body.” Because there is intelligence in every cell of the body. When your mental state is in balance, you feel a connection to your sense of self and your mind. Your behavior is confident and aware; you are by nature inquisitive and intelligent. You take ownership of your actions. However, when your mental state is out of balance, the tendency to become self-obsessed and egotistical takes hold and your behavior becomes insecure and unsure. Your sense of self either becomes too strong and you constantly put your own needs ahead of others, or it becomes too faint, creating weakness and insecurity.\nAnanda’s unique Dhyana meditation program harmonizes the physical, mental and spiritual faculties, balances chakras leading to spiritual enlightenment, stimulates reflex points to restore energy flow in the body, reduces stress, boosts immunity, improves memory and normalizes sleep patterns.\nMy favorite lesser-known detail is:\nMantra meditation is such a powerful part of the mindfulness journey. It relieves the mind from its own obsessive nature. Mantra’s highest power is in its vibrations which impact the mind in several ways. In Kundalini Yoga, chakras are centers of energy. Each chakra is in the shape of a flower, with a different number of petals. We can also think of these chakras as an entire microsystem of nerves and impulses. Each of these nerves plexus are impacted by certain sounds or vibrations. Each petal has a certain “seed” mantra, which activates it. For example, the om (aum) mantra either on its own or when part of a larger practice is what activates the agya chakra or the third eye.\nIn the early morning, the mind is rested. When we recite mantras in the morning, the resolve goes deep and positively influences the emotions, thoughts and actions throughout the day. So at Ananda the Mahamrityunjaya mantra is chanted each morning specifically for well-being. After that is the Gayatri mantra for creative power or energy. It’s my favorite element of the mindful journey. And, along with our yogis, we go deeper into understanding and teaching the intricate nuances of this ancient wisdom.\nI hope our guests walk away feeling: More connected with their positive mental state, balancing emotional as well as spiritual growth. The program teaches practices that can be incorporated into daily life back home to ensure continued, long-term results. It does require effort and, for the true effects of a mindful, conscious journey to be reaped, three essentials are regularity of practice, practice for a sustained period of time and, lastly, faith in your own ability to transcend challenges to lead a fulfilled and blissful life.\nMindfulness is so much more than a trend because:\nMindfulness has been in practice for more than 5,000 years in the vedic system in India. The mental body is a retainer for all of the patterns we have accumulated, all the ways that we go about living our lives based upon our experience and upbringing. These patterns can propel us forward or hold us back from attaining full potential. So, a mindful journey is not a brief experience or a trend. With life getting increasingly fast-paced and digital advancements making us more disconnected in society, it is only by creating an authentic, lifelong journey of such practices that we can see true difference.\nOne moment when mindfulness helped me was:\nThe first time I started mantra meditation, it was a revelation. Each chant took me deeper into a very subtle part of my being. This was a time when I was navigating through several issues both on the work as well as personal front. I remember each mantra chanting practice creating so much clarity of thought, connection and belief in myself. It really helped me and has been helping me ever since.\nThe words I live by are:\nThe best gift I can give to myself and to everyone I am connected to is to create purpose and contentment. The answer lies in small everyday steps, whether spiritual reflection, chanting or immersion in uplifting classical music, which is a personal favorite.\nOne truth that is so important, but people don’t always realize is:\nThat mindfulness is a journey and not something to jump on and master like a competitive sport or a business deal. From becoming self-observant to focusing attention on a single point, extended periods of concentration naturally lead to meditation and ultimately to a state of being keenly aware without focus. At this stage, the mind has been quieted and, in the stillness, it produces few or no thoughts at all. While this may seem like a difficult if not impossible task, remember that all of this journey is a process. Even though we may not attain the picture perfect pose or the ideal state of consciousness, we benefit at every stage of our progress.", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

While the automobile is our most-reported mode of transportation, attention is shifting to the socio-economic value for Niagara of building a seamless region-wide transit system linking efficiently to provincial GO transit.\nThings We Are Doing Well\n- Diverse groups in Niagara are working to inform planning for seamless regional transit, linked to GO train and bus service with capacity to connect Niagara to the GTA and New York State.\n- Significant steps were taken in the fall of 2014 to advance toward a seamless, sustained regional transit system supported by regional government, local municipalities, post-secondary students, and poverty reduction and economic development networks in Niagara.\n- Awareness is building about the value of planning for Active Transportation by looking through lenses such as economic development, Age-Friendly Community principles, accessibility, health and wellness, recreation, tourism and the environment.\n- Niagara’s iconic waterways draw domestic and international traffic, for both recreation and business. A total of 8 marinas on the Great Lakes in Niagara draw significant boat traffic during spring and summer. The Welland Canal portion of the St. Lawrence Seaway allows large lakers and ocean vessels carrying bulk cargo to navigate to and from the heart of North America\n- Multi-faceted linkages between transit availability and accessibility in Niagara and economic development, poverty reduction, wellness, employment and education are being described and quantified.\n- We are gaining increased awareness about students’ and tourists’ role in financially supporting and utilizing public transit in Niagara, along with the economic benefits of making transit available and accessible for them.\n- Growth in our cycling infrastructure and Active Transportation (AT) assets are geared toward creating a viable transportation network that keeps people involved in AT and motorists safe. Niagara’s cycling assets are increasingly being promoted to and appreciated by tourists.\n- The “Getting There” initiative is exploring centrally-dispatched access to health and human services for Niagara’s most vulnerable people.\n- Action to address environmental sustainability and alternative energy through transportation is apparent. Examples include ride and car sharing programs; the existence of 17 Electric Vehicle (EV) charging stations around the region; and promotion of the comparative fuel efficiency and low carbon footprint of marine transportation for shipping bulk cargo.\n- Some efforts are underway to reduce border crossing traffic congestion in Niagara by addressing complex issues around completing secure truck pre-inspections at the Peace Bridge crossing, to reduce overall truck and auto congestion, and improve traffic circulation.\nSuggested Action Steps\n- Increase our understanding of how students, tourists and people going to work utilize transit in Niagara, as important context for transit’s value to the region.\n- Advocate for increased prioritization and funding of transit initiatives across the Region by local municipalities in partnership with the Regional Municipality of Niagara, to create a seamless and viable regional transit service. Further encourage the provincial government to continue to increase funding outside the GTA for transit capital and operating enhancements to meet emerging AODA legislation and the needs and expectations of riders across Niagara.\n- Continue to focus on the economic and quality of life benefits for Niagara of being a “cyclist/biking friendly” community.\n- Apply a healthy community lens in planning to develop walkable, transit supportive and universally accessible communities for all individuals’ enjoyment and participation.\n- Support business model research being completed by the ‘Getting There’ working group, to build a practical strategy for centrally-dispatched access to health and human services for Niagara’s most vulnerable people.\n- Cost of Gasoline\n- Impact of Regional Transit on Rider Quality of Life\n- Student Investment in and Use of Public Transit in Niagara\n- Use of Buses and Public Transportation\n- Development of a Model for Centrally-Dispatched Access to Health and Human Services for Niagara’s Most Vulnerable People\n- Commuting and Distances to Work\n- Active Transportation and Cycling in Niagara\n- Public Electric Vehicle Charging Stations in Niagara\n- Canada-US Border Crossings\n- St. Lawrence Seaway in Niagara: the Welland Canal", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}

The 1972 Aston Martin DBS was discovered in a barn in Surrey, England, in February 2015 and went on to fetch £45,000 ($69k) at a Coys auction in London.\nThis 1960 Jaguar XK150 S had sat in a barn since 1996 after its owner had lost control of the car on a \"wet day\" and crashed it into a tree. Owned by the same person since 1969, its owner has since passed away and the car came up for auction this May. Incredibly, it sold for $127,552 (£90.3k), six times its estimate, even though the car is in need of expensive repair. The high price is down to a combination of a booming classic cars market and the rarity of Jaguar XK150s, especially of the high-performance S model.\nIn 2007, antiques dealer Jeff Bidelman of Rare Collectibles was asked to look through an abandoned house by the late daughter's owner, who heard rumours in her childhood that treasure was buried in a hole in the wall. It turned out the rumours were spot on. Bidelman discovered a haul of old coins worth a very respectable $200,000 (£101k).\nNot only do these two rare Pontiac Firebirds date back to 1967, they were the first two of the classic cars ever to be made, used as a prototype so that the manufacturers could decide if they wanted to produce it. Found in a Connecticut barn in 2014 by Richard Rawlings, the host of Discovery Channel's Fast N'Loud, they were restored and sold for $650,000 (£389k).\nWorkers renovating a winery building in the Champagne region of France got the shock of their life in 2012 when they chanced upon 497 gold coins minted between 1851 and 1928 which were worth a total of $980,000 (£615k). In a surreal moment of discovery, the coins literally rained down through a hole in the rafters, drenching the astonished workers in gold.\nBelieve it or not, this 300-year old statue, estimated to be worth £1.4 million ($1.9m) in 2016, was being used as a doorstop when it was discovered. The bust, created by French sculptor Edmé Bouchardon in 1728, was discovered in 1998 on an industrial estate in Balintore, Scotland by Councillor Maxine Smith. In 2016, it was reported that the former doorstop sculpture would be going on display at the Louvre. Talk about going up in the world.\nWhen Connecticut-based artist Francis Hines passed away in 2016, he left behind hundreds of works of art in a barn he used as a studio. Known as New York's wrapper – he famously wrapped the Washington Square Arch in 8,000 yards of synthetic fabric in 1980 – Hines worked until his death aged 96. The pieces were discovered in 2017 by mechanic Jared Whipple, who received a call from a contractor who thought he might be interested in the works that featured painted car parts. Whipple spent four years researching Hines' art and has been told the collection could be worth \"millions\", with some individual pieces worth up to $22,000 (£16.7k) each. He's been given permission to keep and sell the artworks by Hines' family but plans to keep the majority.

Unsurprisingly, the rare magazines fetched a whopping $3.5 million (£2.9m) at auction in New York in 2012.\nDo you own any of these valuable modern comics?\nAn unsuspecting French heir got a bigger inheritance than he'd bargained for in 2016, when the rickety house he'd inherited turned out to contain a huge stash of gold.

It consisted of 5,000 pieces, two bars and 37 ingots of gold.\nNow read: The largest gold nuggets ever found\nSpeaking of unusual wills, a family who inherited a garage in Newcastle-upon-Tyne, England, were shocked to discover it contained this super-rare car. The 1937 Bugatti 57S was discovered in the garage in 2007, after the passing of 89-year old Dr Harold Carr, along with a Classic Aston Martin, a Jaguar E-Type and a Type 57S Atalante. To the family's delight, the car sold for a staggering £3 million ($4.3m) in February 2009.\nBetween 1985 and 1988, workers in the Polish town of Środa Śląska uncovered a hoard of gold and silver coins and precious jewels during a renovation project on an abandoned telephone exchange.

{"id": "562", "text": "Looking for the perfect Siberian Husky dog name for the newest addition to your family? Adopting a new furry family member is as exciting as it is stressful! Not only will you need to buy the right toys for your Husky, but you’ll also need to get them the perfectly-sized Husky harness and feed them a properly balanced Husky dog food. As if this is not enough to think about, finding the perfect name for your pup is often one of the things a new dog owner frequently struggles with.\nIf the dog you’re adopting happens to be a Husky, you have the added pressure of choosing a name suitable for both their heritage and their personality. If you’re not one to stick to what everyone else is doing, that’s okay. There are plenty of other sources of names for your new Husky friend. You can look at popular culture, books, movies, TV shows, music, and more. You can also look into the heritage of the Husky breed to find the perfect name.\nHuskies are one of the most commonly used dogs in mushing, which can be an excellent source of inspiration for a name. Huskies are also known for their stubbornness, loyalty, and intelligence. They often outsmart their owners and get out of situations that you wouldn’t expect your average Fido to figure out. You can take these things into account when trying out names. Even if you’ve adopted a Siberian Husky mix, many of these names will work just as well for your mutt. Let’s find the perfect name for your Siberian Husky pup!\nPopular Siberian Husky Names\nAn easy jumping-off point for finding Husky names is looking up the most popular options. Similar to naming other popular breeds like the German Shepherd, there are plenty of commonly used names for Siberian Huskies, both male and female. Some people don’t mind if their Siberian Husky’s name is a little more common, especially if it fits their personality.\nHumans often look to the world of music when choosing a name for a new baby, and that same approach can be applied to finding pet names. Choosing a name based on your favorite band or song is a great idea, but make sure that name makes sense with a Husky regarding breed norms. Musicians and their tunes can make a great name for your Husky, provided their personality fits the name. There are endless options for male and female Husky dog names that come from music.\nAs we mentioned with musical names, finding a name in a book that is synonymous with intelligence, class, or stubbornness makes a lot more sense for your Husky than just choosing any old character. Huskies are fierce but also loyal and loveable. Take the personality of your dog into account when selecting a literary namesake. Of course, you can always pick a name from a book or character that means something special to you and share that love with your new Husky pup.\nFilm & TV-Inspired Names\nFilm and television-inspired names are fun and a great way to find unique and nostalgic names for both male and female Huskies. It’s possible that naming a dog after a TV show or movie will result in your pup’s name becoming an oddity down the road, but for some owners, that is just part of the charm. Names from popular, multi-season shows or classic movies are easy to recognize, but there are also plenty of names in lesser-known pieces. Some owners would argue that the most appropriate name on the TV and movies list for your Husky is the last one, given MacGyver’s notoriously quick thinking and ability to get out of almost any situation.\nHuskies are similar to MacGyver in how they think since they are known for escaping their crates, fences, and anything else standing between them and their freedom or doggy dreams. We’ve compiled a list of our very favorite names based on TV and movies to help you name your beautiful pup.\nAlaskan Sled Dog Names\nWhen it comes to naming your dog, it’s sometimes nice to honor their heritage or what makes them popular. Huskies are synonymous with sled dogs and mushing, which means naming your husky after a popular sled dog or mushing term might be a great choice. We’ve come up with 20 names that honor your Husky’s sled dog heritage for your consideration.\nHuman-Inspired Dog Names\nSometimes no traditional dog names sound right for your fur baby, and that’s okay. It’s becoming more and more popular to name dogs using traditionally human names. This trend probably has something to do with our greater societal trend toward treating dogs as full-fledged members of the family, but we can’t say for sure.\nRegardless of the reason for choosing a human name for your Husky, we’ve come up with 20 incredible options to help you narrow down your search.\nMaybe you want to give your talented and intelligent dog a name associated with a true champion. If that’s the case, you can always choose a name from the sports world. The world of sports offers popular inspiration for many dog owners, so thinking through your favorite player or sports team is always a great option. The sports world provides vast inspiration for male and female Husky dog names.\nWolf Ancestry-Inspired Names\nOne thing that makes Huskies unique is how closely they still resemble wolves. You can use that heritage to find the perfect Siberian Husky dog name by looking into names that mean wolf in other languages or relate to wolf characters in pop culture. A wolf-like dog name might be the perfect fit. We’ve come up with 20 names associated with wolves to round out our top 200 Husky names.\nSiberian Husky Naming Tips\nNaming a dog is both a science and an art. You’ll need to understand some basics about dog behavior, but you’ll also want to feel the emotions and see the beauty and strength in the name you choose. There’s a lot to learn before you take on the task of finding the perfect Siberian Husky dog name.\nTip #1: Syllables Matter\nExperts recommend using two-syllable names to add inflections that are more difficult with single-syllable names easily. For example, if your dog’s name is Paisley, you can emphasize the “Pais” portion with upward inflection and then slide your tone down on the “ley” portion to show affection.\nTip #2: Kit Sounds Like Sit\nYou should also avoid names that sound like basic commands. For example, you’ll notice confusion in your dog early on if you choose to name it Cake and then try to teach it to shake.\nTip #3: The Back Door Test\nFinally, we recommend the “back door test” for your Siberian Husky dog name. Narrow down your list of names using other criteria, and then take your favorites to the back door. You’ll literally yell the names out the door to test and see if you like saying them out loud. The back door test helps to eliminate any awkward or inappropriate names before you bring the dog home.\nRemember, Huskies are highly intelligent, stubborn, and loyal. They are working dogs and get bored easily. Try to choose a name that honors their personalities or heritage in some way. Every dog is unique, so you’ll probably want to meet them before settling on the perfect Siberian Husky dog name.\nHusky names don’t have to have any connection to sled dogs or Alaska, but they can if you’d like. You can also base your dog’s name on your favorite activities, sports heroes, or even your dog’s size, which is always fun when naming a bigger dog. Naming your Siberian Husky after other physical traits, like their blue eyes, can also make great names. This is one of the best parts of owning a dog – naming it is entirely up to you!\nNaming a dog is an art in that you can pull inspiration from anywhere. It’s also a science in that there are ways to help your dog respond faster and create a stronger connection. Utilizing both sides of the naming process will help you choose the best name possible for your Husky.\nShare The Infographic Below On Your Site", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

Do not be fooled by the lack of parking space at their location. The German tech shop which had been repairing my BMW for many years would not address the electrical issues to repair the dashboard of my 2001 330i because of the complexities and there were no guarantees they could fix it.

{"id": "567", "text": "DEARBORN, Mich., July 16, 2019 – Ford and Roush Performance today unveil the 2019 “Old Crow” Mustang GT, a charity collaboration project which pays homage to World War II triple ace pilot Colonel Bud Anderson of the U.S. Army Air Force and the legendary P-51 Mustang fighter planes he flew in combat – nicknamed “Old Crow.”\nThis one-of-one Mustang will be auctioned at the Experimental Aircraft Association’s 2019 AirVenture air show on July 25 in Oshkosh, Wisconsin. All proceeds will be donated to support EAA’s youth and adult aviation programs, many of which help prepare the next generation of America’s great pilots.\nBuilt by Roush Performance, the “Old Crow” Mustang GT features a custom paint scheme and badging replicating Col. Anderson’s iconic P-51 Mustang fighter plane. A custom Roush grille with P-51 Mustang badge adorns the front, the words “Old Crow” are written on the hood and an authentic Eighth Air Force emblem badge adorns the decklid panel.\nPerformance in the “Old Crow” Mustang GT comes by way of a Ford and Roush Performance TVS R2650 supercharger, which boosts the 5.0-liter V8 engine to 710 horsepower and 610 lb.-ft. of torque. Other performance upgrades include a Roush Performance cold air induction system and X pipe, plus a custom active exhaust system from Ford Performance.\nThe “Old Crow” Mustang uses Ford’s MagneRide® damping system and puts power to the ground through a set of custom 20-inch lightweight Roush wheels wrapped in 275/35R Continental ExtremeContact sport tires.\nExterior enhancements include Roush rear fascia aerofoils, Ford Performance front racing spoiler, 2020 Mustang Shelby® GT500® rear spoiler, custom heat extractors on the hood and blue rainbow tinted exhaust tips that emulate the exhaust on the P-51 Mustang planes.\nInside the cabin, a fully custom, aircraft-inspired interior features unique military-themed green leather and canvas and red shifter nob and door handles. “P-51” is written on the passenger-side dashboard. The vehicle includes Sparco four-point harness as well as aluminum rear seat-delete.\n“Heroes like Col. Bud Anderson have become true living legends in the 75 years since the Allied invasion of Normandy,” said Craig Metros, Ford design director. “Ford is proud to team up with Roush Performance to honor Col. Anderson and all of the brave servicemen and servicewomen who risked their lives during World War II, all while raising funds for the Experimental Aircraft Association, which helps make flying more accessible to America’s youth.”\nCol. Anderson achieved more than 16 aerial victories in Europe during World War II. He flew 116 combat missions, including a six-hour mission on D-Day. He was never struck by enemy fire or forced to withdraw from an aerial engagement during his career. Col. Anderson’s service earned him more than 25 decorations including the Distinguished Flying Cross, Bronze Star and Air Medal.\nRoush Enterprises founder and aviation enthusiast Jack Roush, Sr. honored Col. Anderson in 1994 by fully re-creating an authentic P-51 Mustang aircraft with the same badging and paint scheme as the Anderson’s “Old Crow” Mustang plane.\n“It is truly special to have the opportunity to honor a great American hero and a truly great friend of mine such as Col. Bud Anderson,” said Roush, Sr.. “My father instilled in me a love of aviation and a deep respect for the brave pilots and airmen of World War II. Building this incredible ‘Old Crow’ Mustang, especially to support the next generation of America’s pilots, has been a very rewarding opportunity and one that we’re proud to share with the world.”\nThe “Old Crow” Mustang GT will be displayed during EAA’s AirVenture show from July 22-28. EAA AirVenture guests can get an up-close look before the car is auctioned on July 25 at the annual EAA AirVenture auction – The Gathering.\nEAA AirVenture attracts more than 600,000 aviation enthusiasts to Wittman Regional Airport in Oshkosh, Wisconsin every year. Ford has supported EAA AirVenture for 21 years, building and donating 11 custom-designed vehicles to help raise more than $3.5 million to date.\nThese include the 2018 Eagle Squadron Mustang, 2016 “Ole Yeller” Mustang and 2015 Mustang Apollo Edition. Ford’s highest-selling vehicle auctioned at AirVenture is the 2008 Mustang AV8R, which sold for $500,000.\n“Ford and Roush Performance are helping build the next generation of aviation through their support of EAA, AirVenture and The Gathering,” said Jack J. Pelton, EAA CEO and Chairman of the Board. “This project not only will be a highlight of The Gathering; its impact will help EAA reach those who are pursuing their own dreams of flight.”\nBidding at “The Gathering” auction is open to all interested parties. Bids can be made in person or remotely online.\nTo learn more about the “Old Crow” Mustang GT and Roush Performance’s full line of vehicles and performance products, visit https://www.roushperformance.com/.

{"id": "577", "text": "Photo: Martin at his desk, March 2009, from the film The Rescuers\n800 words / 4 minute read\nFrom my first days as Churchill’s biographer in 1968 I began to receive letters from people who wanted to tap my imagined expertise. Sometimes I get as many as a dozen such letters a week. Most people want me to confirm a Churchill story or to verify a quotation. This, though seemingly simple, can take hours, even if it can be done at all. Auction houses seek confirmation that a Churchill signature being offered for sale is genuine (it is surprising how often it is not). Many of those who write to me hope that I may be able to date a photograph, or to identify the people who appear on either side of Churchill. Some want to know if Churchill stayed at their homes, or had some connection with their region or their professional work, with a view to putting up a plaque.\nEvery facet of Churchill’s life, from the most profound to the most bizarre, has crossed my desk in the form of queries. The most frequent are about his cigars, his brandy and his cats.\nA few of those who wrote to me claimed to be Churchill’s illegitimate children. Several others asked me to confirm that Brendan Bracken, his friend and wartime Minister of Information, was such a child. In no case did illegitimacy seem at all possible, despite the uncertainty of paternity. I was able to give a decisive reply to the woman who said that Churchill and her mother had had an illicit liaison (Churchill had then been a married man for seven years) on board a troopship in the eastern Mediterranean in the summer of 1915, nine months before her birth. Throughout that summer Churchill had been in London and, at weekends, at Hoe Farm near Godalming, in Surrey.\nThe desire to have some link with Churchill in distant lands was a regular feature of enquiries. When I was in the Crimea in 1989, I was offered a trip to “the grave of Churchill’s father”, killed in action, it seems, during the Battle of Balaclava in 1854, twenty years before Churchill’s birth, and buried within sight of the Black Sea. In fact, Lord Randolph had died in London in 1895, and was buried at Bladon, within sight of the towers of Blenheim Palace. Also in 1989, as the Soviet Union turned from communism to glasnost, the Lvov Medical Institute, a branch of the Ukrainian Ministry of Health, asked the British Embassy in Moscow to confirm that Churchill had gone to the Carpathian spa town of Skole in the 1930s “with the aim of restoring his health”. A new medical centre was being developed there; no doubt the institute had hoped to put up a plaque: “Britain’s war leader took the waters here,” a good advertisement in the changing times. But there was no evidence that Churchill had gone anywhere in Europe east of Munich in the 1930s, let alone into deepest then-Polish Galicia.\nIn 1985 I was approached by the Attorney-General’s office of Alberta, Canada. The province was seeking to put on trial a teacher who, in denouncing the malign influence of the Jews, had quoted Churchill as an authority. The quotation he used was well known to me, and as it was also taken out of context, I was able to provide the court with the full quotation, and an explanation of Churchill’s views.\nAs cited by the teacher, Churchill had denounced the Bolshevik Jews controlling the Soviet regime in 1920, and had likened them to a worldwide “sinister conspiracy” of Jews who worked to undermine democracy. Churchill’s actual article, published in the Illustrated Sunday Herald of 8 February 1920, had set out his thoughts on three very different types of Jewish involvement in national life: the Bolshevik involvement, which he abhorred; the assimilationists, of whom he approved; and the Zionists, about whom he wrote with both fervour and prescience: “If, as may happen, there should be created in our lifetime, by the banks of the Jordan, a Jewish state under the protection of the British crown, which might comprise three or four millions of Jews, an event would have occurred in the history of the world which would, from every point of view, be beneficial.” This was written in 1930. In 1992 the Jewish population of the State of Israel reached four million.\nThe queries of readers, fellow historians, other writers and even schoolchildren stimulate the search and keep the focus sharp. Churchill will always be the object of curiosity and controversy. To every enquiry there is an answer and to every controversy there is a truth. It is the search for truth that has made the quest so exhilarating. I suppose that letters will keep reaching me long after my Churchill pen is laid to rest. I shall certainly not complain if this is so.\nAn excerpt from In Search of Churchill\nRead: In Search of Churchill", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}

{"id": "581", "text": "The year is 1960, and the scene is Great Falls, Montana. A real town which, like Richard Russo’s fictional Empire Falls, Maine, seems chosen for the irony in the name given the story to be told. The protagonist and narrator here is Dell Parsons, a fifteen-year-old boy who is earnest but rootless, with a father in the military whose rank isn’t what it once was, a twin sister who’s light years ahead of him developmentally but lacks his passion for school or chess, and a mother and part-time schoolteacher who is hostage to her lowly and itinerant circumstances. “We were a family who didn’t travel,” Dell tells us, “unless we were moving to a new town.”\nThe general contours of the disaster to come, we learn on page one:\n“First, I’ll tell about the robbery our parents committed. Then about the murders, which happened later. The robbery is the more important part, since it served to set my and my sister’s lives on the courses they eventually followed. Nothing would make complete sense without that being told first.”\nThis is confident, even audacious storytelling—not because it’s showy, but because it refuses to show off at all. In the early going, Ford leaps forward on occasion, teasing out what’s coming, sometimes narrating from the perspective of an earnest fifteen-year-old, other times with the benefit of adult hindsight. Some of this is hardly even noticeable, and all of it works.\nTo some extent the suspense lies in how these crimes will come to be committed. But far more than this, the story is driven by how these events come to shape a young man trying to find his way in a young life; how he sees what is happening to his family and himself; and what he makes of life under extreme circumstances, after he’s driven by his aunt north across the border to avoid becoming a ward of the state. There he lives with shady characters in a sparsely populated backwater that has a lodge where Americans come to hunt ducks and Dell works for his keep. Dell makes of it what he can.\n“It would never be a place with big oak trees and a football field and boys my age to accept me—the way I’d almost had it in Great Falls. This would never be what I wanted. It was Canada.”\nDell’s father, Bev Parsons, is a man burdened by limitless imagination, endless optimism and an astonishing lack of judgment, who finds a silver lining in any omen. When the bank he cased for a heist at nine o’clock one morning turns out to be far busier than he’d seen before on the day in question, he convinces himself all this will serve as some grand diversion. Needless to say, it doesn’t.\nThe first of two or three beautiful endings—at the close of Part One, two hundred pages in—has Dell’s twin sister leaving the house after their parents are jailed and nobody’s yet come to take them away.\n“To concentrate on Berner leaving would make all this seem to be about loss—which isn’t how I think about it to this very day. I think of it as being about progress, and the future, which aren’t always easy to see when you’re so close to both of them.”\nPart Two begins shortly thereafter and just in time, with a friend of their mother coming to take Dell before the child welfare services people descend. She drives him north for hours, crossing the border and dropping him into his new life. He grows up in a hurry, and meets some indelible characters in a once-grand duck-hunting lodge, though the parts Dell lives in are spartan to say the least. The grand character at the center of it, one Arthur Remlinger, owns the lodge and his own mysterious background, which has him living so far from anything that feels like civilization or normal life. Dell will finish growing up here, and one wonders what will become of him.\nIn Part Three we meet the adult Dell has become, a middle-aged secondary school teacher in Canada. We learn what he’s made of all that went on before, and what’s become of his twin sister, who has lived a lowly life and taken their father’s name, Bev, as hers some years back. In the closing portions of the novel, the aging narrator who opened the story reflects back on all this from whatever perspective our lives give us. Wry, dry pearls follow. Like the first five pages, which feature some of the most keenly observed descriptions of a protagonist’s parents in the American canon, these last five pages are worth the price of admission all on their own.\nIn between lies the great American novel of our times.\nMatthew Geyer is the author of two novels, Strays (2008) and Atlantic View (2020). .", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}

{"id": "583", "text": "SAN FRANCISCO, CA — May 1, 2012 – With Mitt Romney now the presumptive Republican nominee for the 2012 presidential election, Maven, the Global Knowledge Marketplace, has released the results of its most recent presidential election tracking survey. The results show the power of the incumbency weighing heavily in Obama’s favor.\nNational polls published last week showed Obama and Romney almost dead even. However, Maven’s fifth survey of political insiders shows Barack Obama with a commanding lead, beating Romney by nearly 40 percent on the queston of who is likely to win in November.\nIn the Maven survey, 69 percent of respondents believed that Barack Obama will win reelection in November 2012, up from 60 percent in the January survey and 48 percent in the October survey. Meanwhile, Mitt Romney, who was neck and neck with Obama in October, slipped to 31 percent in April.\nThe survey’s respondents included political consultants, lobbyists, and government relations professionals from Maven’s extensive microconsulting network.\n“Perhaps the most interesting outcome of this month’s survey is the fact that slightly over half of all respondents indicated that they voted for John McCain in 2008 – and nearly half of them believe that Obama will win this year,” commented Maven Co-Founder and CEO Wyatt Nordstrom. “ In other words, Republican insiders seem to believe that Romney will lose. Whether this is the result of lingering sour grapes over their preferred Republican candidates’ primary losses to Romney or a true indication of serious doubts of Romney’s ability to confront Obama remains to be seen.”\nAs in previous surveys, participants were asked to comment on the reasons for their selections. Highlights include:\n- Respondents cited the power of an incumbent President as the main reason Obama will be re-elected in 2012. One respondent summed it up as follows:\nObama enjoys the benefits of incumbency. He has no significant opposition in his party’s nomination process, and is therefore able to raise money for use in the general election rather than versus primary opponents. Even with the Republican Party’s nomination effectively decided, that party has not yet coalesced around its candidate, and is unlikely to really do so before the fall.\nAnother respondent added:\nThe power of incumbency brings with it percentage points – perhaps 5 – of advantage almost by default. If oil prices go down, economic trends continue to improve, and more troops are brought home, the incumbent is nearly a lock. The presumed challenger does not bring enough enthusiasm, particularly from the most conservative blocks, to sway enough voters to create an upset in 2012 barring unforeseen changes.\n- An additional factor – Obama’s fundraising skills – was cited as a reason for an Obama victory, according to the political Mavens surveyed. One Maven said it this way:\nI believe Obama will have a sufficient money advantage and will once again show his skill as a good campaigner to win reelection. I do not feel the Republicans will field a candidate with the appeal to overcome the Obama ‘mystique.’\nAnother respondent added:\nObama will likely win both the popular and delegate votes. He spends much time and money on campaigning and most of his base will vote in the same fashion.\n- On the contrary, others predicted that Romney will win the general election due to lingering economic and other domestic issues. As one respondent noted:\nThe present state of the economy and lack of recovery will negate President Obama’s popularity… Romney has a more concise energy plan. He understands that we need to develop a comprehensive energy policy…\nThe economic recovery will continue to be sluggish through the fall. Many independent voters are looking for an alternative to President Obama, and will support the challenger if they can be persuaded that he can meet a baseline competence threshold.”\nThis is the fifth in a series of surveys conducted by Maven leading up to the November 2012 election. Results are tracked to illustrate how sentiment among the respondent population changes as events unfold.\nMembers of the news media interested in speaking with the Survey respondents should contact Maven at email@example.com.\nMaven is a global network of industry professionals, thought leaders, and experts who connect, share knowledge, and help each other address business challenges of all sizes. Maven’s proprietary “microconsulting” platform provides instant access to highly qualified experts from every background via paid knowledge sharing interactions, including:\n- Telephone Consultations\n- Electronic Surveys\n- Extended Consulting Projects\n- Intelligence Markets\n- Business Education Workshops & Seminars\n- Strategic Advisory\n- Knowledge Communities, powered by Maven\nMaven – Faster Insights.

This summer we want to run TWO CAMPS !!!\nBoth camps will be for 4 days (3 nights) at Rotbav in the county Brasov.\n- The first is for children (aged 7-11) and will take place between 18th and 21st July\n- The second is for teens (aged 12-15) and will take place between 1st and 4th August\nWhy are we running two camps this year?\nThe simple answer is that there are more children! The work has grown over 5 years! In years gone by we raised money to take children and teens from Bodesti away each summer. While this was great for them, there were children in other places where we work that were not able to go on a camp.\nThe vision this year is to have two age-related camps that each accommodate up to 34 children from Bodesti, Bargauani and Piatra Neamt. This way, all children who come regularly to our weekly programs will have an opportunity to go on a camp.\nWhy do we do camps?\nIt would be far easier to sit at home this summer and relax! Running a camp is really hard work. But we do it...\n- To give poor children a chance to have a holiday (many children in the villages never go away on family holidays)\n- Because the Bible tells us to scatter abroad our gifts to the poor (Psalm 112 v 9), that faith should be accompanied by action especially towards the poor (James 2 v 17), and that Jesus loves children! (Luke 18 v 19)\n- To build relationships between children, between leaders, and between children and leaders\n- To have a unique time in which the Bible message can be shared with young lives\n- To strengthen the ongoing work with children and their families in the places we work\n- To work together (both here in Romania and also with churches and supporters across the globe)\nHow can you get involved?\nIt is wonderful that we can achieve such projects together! Sharing the load makes it easier for the individual to contribute and make a difference! You can share in this project together by helping us with the following:\n- Praying for these two camps, for preparation, leaders, participants, accommodation, travel, activities, finance, welfare etc\n- Giving financially (see below)\n- Inspiring us with ideas of how we can fundraise here as a church on the ground in Romania\n- Sharing this email with somebody else\nHow much do we need to raise and how are we going to do it?\nEach camp will cost about 2,500 Euros. That includes transport, accommodation, food, activities and all the necessary materials. In total, we need to raise 5,000 Euros. How do we plan to do this? There are 4 ways:\n- The money the Church has already received\n- Admission fees. We are going to ask children who can, to contribute something towards their own cost\n- Local fundraising\n- Support from overseas", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}

Notable exceptions are people age 65-80 years for whom shared decision-making is emphasized, and people over 80 years old (or younger patients with short life expectancy) for whom transfemoral transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is now recommended.\n\"Current research and new technology continue to transform the treatment of heart valve disease, as updated lifestyle and medication guidance evolve, and less invasive procedures have replaced traditional surgery for many patients,\" said guideline writing committee co-chair Catherine Otto, MD, of the University of Washington in Seattle, in a press release.\nWith the new guideline, ACC/AHA reviewers incorporated evidence from 2019 that people with severe aortic stenosis and low surgical risk have clinical outcomes that are on par with or even better than surgery. The indication for low-risk TAVR was FDA approved within months of the PARTNER 3 and Evolut Low Risk trial presentations.\nGuideline authors noted that the timing of treatment for aortic stenosis should be based primarily on symptoms or reduced ventricular systolic function. For some with severe aortic stenosis but no symptoms, aortic valve replacement may be reasonable.\nAs for people with valvular regurgitation, Otto's group determined that the indications for intervention are for symptom relief and prevention of the irreversible long-term consequences of left ventricular volume overload.\nOther class I recommendations call for aortic valve surgery in symptomatic patients with severe aortic regurgitation, regardless of left ventricular (LV) systolic function, and in asymptomatic patients with severe aortic regurgitation and LV systolic dysfunction. Aortic valve surgery may be considered in other asymptomatic patients meeting certain criteria.\n\"Thresholds for intervention now are lower than they were previously because of more durable treatment options and lower procedural risks,\" according to the authors.\nAnother important addition to the guidelines is the class IIa recommendation for mitral transcatheter edge-to-edge repair (previously dubbed \"transcatheter mitral valve repair\") to treat patients with chronic severe secondary mitral regurgitation related to LV systolic dysfunction who remain severely symptomatic despite guideline-directed medical therapy.\nSupporting this decision was evidence from 2019's COAPT trial showing quality of life benefits of MitraClip therapy in these patients.\nOtto and colleagues also handed a small boost to mitral transcatheter edge-to-edge repair for people with severely symptomatic primary mitral regurgitation who are at high or prohibitive risk for surgery.\nThe old class IIb (weak) recommendation for this procedure was bumped up to class IIa (moderate) when mitral valve anatomy is favorable and patient life expectancy is at least 1 year.\nThe ACC/AHA guideline was developed in collaboration with and endorsed by the American Association for Thoracic Surgery, the American Society of Echocardiography, the Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions, the Society of Cardiovascular Anesthesiologists, and the Society of Thoracic Surgeons.\nOtto had no disclosures.\nSource Reference: Otto CM, et al \"2020 ACC/AHA guideline for the management of patients with valvular heart disease: a report of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines\" Circulation 2020; DOI: 10.1161/CIR.0000000000000923.", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}

{"id": "589", "text": "Convert Lawn to Gardens\nTired of mowing all that grass? Consider converting a portion of the lawn into a flower or vegetable garden.\nIf you have a healthy lawn, your soil is probably in good shape. Simply edge the area you plan to convert into garden. Use a sharp spade or edger to cut through the grass roots. Then cut the grass you plan to eliminate as short as possible. Cover with several layers of newspaper or a layer of cardboard. Top this with shredded leaves, herbicide-free grass clippings, evergreen needles or woodchips.\nThe newspaper or cardboard layer provides an additional barrier to the weeds. And, as it breaks down and the grass beneath dies and decomposes, they add organic matter to the soil below.\nYou can plant immediately, but you’ll need more effort to dig through the paper layer and freshly covered turf. Or wait a few months for everything to decompose for easier planting.\nA bit more information: You can also remove the existing sod with a sod cutter or flat shovel. Use healthy sections of grass to repair damaged areas in the lawn. Or place it in the compost bin, grass side down.

Vegas’ sprawling tunnel system is home to 300 to 400 people who have built lives for themselves underground.\nIn the 1990s, the city began construction on storm-drainage tunnels to prevent against flash floods. Two hundred miles of flood tunnels were built, and today they house much of Las Vegas’ homeless population. Many of them are veterans suffering from PTSD. Others came to Las Vegas in search of a better life and fell onto hard times. The tunnels are largely ignored by police, and a peek inside shows evidence of life at every turn. One section has been transformed into something of an art gallery with detailed graffiti filling the walls. Another space houses a couple who have fully furnished the 400 square-foot room with a wardrobe, a double bed, and a bookshelf that holds a small library of salvaged books.\nSuch elaborate living spaces become problematic whenever the flood tunnels are used for their original purpose. Rain water can flow through the tunnels and wash away the residents' belongings, which one dweller referred to as “flushing the toilet.”\nAfter journalist Matthew O’Brien discovered the Las Vegas tunnels when reporting a story, he founded the Shine a Light project to provide food, clothing, services, and more to the city’s underground homeless population. Together with HELP of Southern Nevada, they set up people in desperate situations with alternative housing and the attention they need.

{"id": "596", "text": "'Scandal' TV Show: How It Teaches the Benefits Of Loyalty\nLoyalty is in short supply this day and age, as Americans are at each other’s throats as partisanship has spread from Washington into our daily lives\nFor the past several days, I have rifled through a number of episodes of Scandal , an ABC series. It features Kerry Washington as Olivia Pope, a “fixer” of political and personal problems in the nation’s capital. Admittedly, my attraction to the show is partially because of the star character’s beauty and charisma. However, the storyline contains another important theme that most viewers should appreciate: loyalty.\nEvery one of Pope’s employees has a very complex and dysfunctional history including insider trading, domestic violence, black ops, and murder. These people are loyal to Pope, who recruited each one of them during low points in their lives. She is the mastermind of her business, and when she speaks it is gospel.\nPope is loyal to her subordinates to an extreme, a trait that is certainly becoming less prevalent in our society. She loves her co-workers and protects them. Her firm is a well-oiled machine where each employee does his or her job with enthusiasm and great skill. But the most important thing that binds them is loyalty.\nScandal is sensational and unrealistic at times. But, the underlying importance of loyalty to the program is something worth dwelling upon in our lives. And so, here are eight aspects of life where loyalty is important.\nFidelity to one’s life partner is probably the most intimate form of loyalty. It’s what solidifies a relationship between lovers. How can two people share their most private thoughts in an environment devoid of trust? When one party steps over the line, the bond is broken and is forever lost. It is the beginning of a slippery slope that is impossible to reverse. Can a person in a relationship ever forget betrayal? I don’t believe so.\nThere are many among us who are unhappy with our government. Young people today believe they are unique in this regard. Discontent in American history is not a new phenomenon. Nevertheless, most protesters believe America continues to be the greatest place on earth. Loyalty comes into play when malcontents resort to violence to make their point. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. never encouraged physical confrontation, and he was responsible for some of the most important social changes in America. When anyone crosses the line, from peaceful to violent protest, his relationship with this country is marred forever.\nThe bond that exists between a company and its employees is critical to the success of the enterprise. There are very few more important symbiotic relationships. In fact, every company proclaims its workers are its most important asset. Yet, the two have experienced many strained moments since the Industrial Revolution. At different times, the pendulum swings and one group dominates the other. But, when an advantage becomes abusive, unfair work rules or excessive compensation demands, loyalty and partnership are lost and both sides suffer.\nGenerally, if every American strove to be “fair” in their dealings with others, the country would be a better place. However, cheating on taxes, cheating on medical reimbursement, stealing from others, taking advantage of customers, and so on, erodes the loyalty and trust we have for each other. The resultant society is one that is more dysfunctional each year and far less efficient. If medical fraud vanished, the savings would likely be large enough to finance universal health care.\nAmericans must obey the law, if our society is going to persevere. Every misdemeanor and felony weakens our nation and must be dealt with aggressively by the courts. Those that abuse others, create havoc, commit crimes against humanity, etc. must be punished with little mercy. And those who threaten national security are among the worst offenders. They are in effect attacking our way of life and each American’s chances to be happy.\n6. Ethics and morality\nBehavior is also affected by our personal standards. Americans must be ethical and moral. We should make decisions that are righteous and fair, with empathy for others. Standing by and watching Americans starve for any reason is immoral. Not providing an education for all children in America is unconscionable.\n7. Hard work\nAmericans must be able to work. It is the responsibility of the federal government to create jobs if the private sector cannot. Many of the political and social problems we face as a nation have evolved from a system that does not demand that every able-bodied person work. Giving people aid who are not handicapped is a form of enslavement. It is unfair, as the recipient’s dependence grows with each dollar of aid, and it is unfair to working Americans who are taxed to finance inappropriate financial benefits.\nEvery person has a constitutional and God-given right to be happy, so long as it is not at the expense of others. Gay marriage is a perfect example of this issue. There is no public policy benefit to prohibit two people of the same sex to formally express their love for each other.\nOlivia Pope is loyal to her employees, and her employees are loyal to her. It’s a mutually beneficial arrangement. Americans should be loyal and expect it from others in return.", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}

{"id": "599", "text": "When considering window treatments, there is a wide array of choices for homeowners, including curtains, blinds, shades, and drapes. Yet, among these options, the plantation shutter distinguishes itself with its enduring elegance and practicality. Renowned for centuries, these versatile and timeless window treatments have maintained popularity for good reasons.\nAt Mike’s Flooring & Design Center, we collaborate with top-notch manufacturers of plantation shutters to guarantee that the windows in your Ocean Pines, MD home or business exude their utmost charm.\nWhy Choose Plantation Shutters For Your Property in Ocean Pines, MD?\nAesthetics and Versatility\nPlantation shutters, with their wide louvers and clean lines, add a touch of sophistication to any room. Their classic design complements various architectural styles, from traditional to contemporary. Available in a range of materials such as wood, vinyl, and composite, these shutters can be customized to suit the unique character of your home.\nLight Control and Privacy\nOne of the primary advantages of plantation shutters is their exceptional light control. The adjustable louvers allow you to regulate the amount of natural light entering a room, providing a versatile solution for different times of the day. By tilting the louvers, you can enjoy soft diffused light or create a private sanctuary, shielding your interiors from prying eyes.\nPlantation shutters are not just a decorative element; they also contribute to energy efficiency. When closed, they act as an additional layer of insulation, helping to regulate indoor temperatures. This can lead to reduced energy consumption by minimizing the need for excessive heating or cooling, ultimately saving on utility bills.\nDurability and Low Maintenance\nInvesting in quality plantation shutters ensures long-lasting durability. Unlike traditional blinds or curtains that may wear out over time, these shutters are built to withstand the test of time. Their sturdy construction makes them resistant to warping, fading, and cracking. Additionally, maintaining plantation shutters is a breeze; a simple wipe-down with a damp cloth is often sufficient to keep them looking pristine.\nIncreased Property Value\nHome improvements that enhance both functionality and aesthetics can significantly increase the value of your property. Plantation shutters, being a permanent fixture, are considered an attractive feature by potential buyers. The timeless appeal and durability of these shutters can make your home stand out in the real estate market, offering a return on investment that extends beyond personal enjoyment.\nEvery home is unique, and plantation shutters can be tailored to suit individual preferences and requirements. From choosing the material and color to deciding on the louver size, homeowners have the freedom to customize these shutters according to their style and functional needs. This level of personalization ensures that the shutters seamlessly integrate into the overall design of the home.\nFor individuals with allergies, plantation shutters present a practical solution. Unlike curtains and blinds that can trap dust and allergens, shutters are easy to clean, minimizing the accumulation of irritants in your living space. This can contribute to a healthier indoor environment, particularly for those who suffer from allergies or respiratory issues.\nWhat Makes Mike’s Flooring & Design Center the Best Choice For Plantation Shutters?\nIf you’re committed to having plantation shutters installed, come and see us at Mike’s Flooring & Design Center!\n- We have been serving the areas of Delmarva and Sussex County, DE, and Ocean City, MD, since 1996—more than 25 years!\n- We carefully choose the contractors we work with—all of our contracting partners are highly skilled and experienced.\n- We care about customer service, and we will work with you to ensure that you’re 100% satisfied with the job we’ve done.\n- We continue to offer customer support after installation, and we’re happy to help you troubleshoot any problems at any time.\n- We are serious about community outreach and have supported numerous charities and local organizations.\nWhich Manufacturers Provide Products For Your Plantation Shutters in Ocean Pines, MD?\nContact Mike’s Flooring and Design Center For Plantation Shutters in Ocean Pines, MD\nPlease feel free to contact us through our online contact form, call us at 302-537-1899 or email us at firstname.lastname@example.org, and we will be more than happy to assist you with your project.

Made from scratch pasta, perfectly tender meatballs, thin crusted pizzas...need we say more? Minneapolis is home to creative Italian restaurants with superb flavors, beautiful atmospheres and date night deals. Dine at these Italian restaurants to have a *bella notte* in Minneapolis.\nTo make planning your evening easier, we've grouped these restaurants by region in Minneapolis.\nFor a lovely ambiance, dine at Giulia nestled in the foliage-filled and column-lined lobby of Hotel Emery. Giulia’s menu focuses on Northern Italian cuisine and the bar mixes craft cocktails with local spirits and pours Italian wines. While you dine, you’ll get a view of the open kitchen where small plates, fresh pasta and wood-fired pizzas are prepared. Giulia serves decadent brunch on weekends, like chocolatey crepes and pizzas topped with eggs.\nSeeing a show or orchestra performance downtown? Make reservations at Zelo for simple and fresh Italian cuisine. A staple restaurant in downtown Minneapolis since 1999, it’ll be hard to choose between pizza and flatbreads, pasta, a burger or steak. And if you don’t have a ton of time to spare, enjoy a glass of wine at their classy bar.\nFind approachable, delicious and friendly Italian fare in East Town. EaTo is a great spot for dinner before a show at the Guthrie Theater, and the seasonal dinner menu has enough variety to keep you going back for more. Pastas and pizzas are the stars of the menu…the penne alla vodka is a delicious choice as is the funghi pizza, which has a creamy white sauce. Enjoy your bites in the colorful eatery or outside during patio season. (Psst…don’t miss their happy hour! Five-dollar wines, $6 cocktails and $7 snacks!)\n4. Bar La Grassa\nRegarded as one of the best date night restaurants in Minneapolis, Bar La Grassa is swanky and guaranteed to treat your tastebuds well. Headed by James Beard award-winning chef Isaac Baker and Nancy St. Pierre, the menu is filled with unique varieties of decadent pasta, smooth wines and perfect desserts. To be truly blown away, order the gnocchi with cauliflower and orange or the maltagliati with milk-braised short rib and ricotta sugo.\n112 Eatery is sophisticated and elegant with a cozy and homey feel and great service. Expect dimly lit dining rooms, exposed brick and colorful art adorning the walls. Salad fans should order the wilted kale salad for its sweet and salty almond vinaigrette. If you’re looking to splurge, try the gnocchi with lobster and arrabbiata sauce, and the 112 Cheeseburger is delicious if you want a handheld. The menu features frog legs, an Italian delicacy, too.\n6. Red Rabbit\nRed Rabbit is what we would call “rustic-chic” and has neighborhood vibes. With its low lighting, exposed brick and cozy red booths, it’s the perfect place to enjoy a hearty Italian meal. A standout menu item here? Spaghetti and meatballs. We know it’s simple, but this dish is made to perfection. The meatballs are tender, and the flavors of the red sauce are enhanced with herbs and slices of garlic.\nLooking for Italian food with a cultural twist? Visit Chef Daniel del Prado’s Sanjusan for Japanese-Italian culinary perfection. Think Italian dishes with Japanese flavors, like miso pesto, spicy pork, raw tuna and toasted nori. Don’t skip over the yakitori section of the menu. These skewered pieces of chicken, tenderloin, meatballs and more are a great addition to your pasta or pizza.\nNew to the block is Dario, which is becoming popular for its handmade pastas of all shapes, colors and flavors. Stop in for a weeknight drink, a plate of pasta or try a multi-course experience. The menu features four sections: raw oysters, crudo (raw fish-focused dishes), pasta and vegetables. Sharing and mixing and matching is encouraged here. Dine in the main room or the Pasta Room and enjoy the delightfully pink and blue modern interior.\nA neighborhood eatery at heart, ie (Italian Eatery) specializes in Italian dishes made from scratch that won’t break the bank. People flock here for flavorful handmade pasta dishes — like the savory mushroom cappelletti and pappardelle with yam puree, whipped ricotta and honey — but you can’t go wrong with any of the mains either. Try the dry rubbed beef short rib and consider getting a plate of Roman meatballs to share. For sips and snacks, visit their sister space, Un Dito, for a menu inspired by Sicilian seaside street food.\nFor a budget-friendly dinner for two, visit Pinoli by Minneapolis’ Chain of Lakes for some of the best date night specials in town. Their most popular special is a Roman pizza dinner. Choose an anti pasti, two Roman pizzas, a dessert to share plus a bottle of wine for $42. Pinoli’s pizzas are topped with anything from braised mushroom to pistachio and truffle and marinated seafood.\nAt Broder’s Pasta Bar, pasta is served the way it’s meant to be: fresh, al dente and perfectly sauced. The menu is filled with seasonal pastas, but Broder’s is known for the classics. The penne rosmarino is a favorite among customers for its rosemary tomato cream chili sauce. Don’t fill up with just bread and pasta though — save room for the chocolate cherry cheesecake.\nEverything from pasta and meatballs to bruschetta and braised pork is done right at Prima. This neighborhood restaurant has fed locals Italian fare since 1999 and is a go-to spot for many. Order the roasted beet salad to start and enjoy it with a basket of bread. Favorite dishes on the menu are the goat cheese and herb ravioli and the grilled chicken risotto. Dining with kids? They’ll love the simple penne noodles with butter and parmesan.", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}
{"id": "604", "text": "We are in the heart of the city, more precisely at 1, Via San Spiridione, to discover a gem that opened its doors just a few weeks ago. And who could be behind this marvelous and ambitious project if not Walter Gustin himself who, with his 040 Group, counts several venues scattered around the city? From 040 Social Food to...shall I refresh your memory? The list is long! There's DRAW, LOFT, PIER, all the way up to the more recent BOA BEACH.\nYet Walter was missing something. Yup, missing from the roll call was a little place designed for staying in town, where he could welcome guests from outside Trieste. Said and done: he transformed 320 square meters of his property into four suites and two rooms, right in the middle of Borgo Teresiano.\nI had the chance to see them in advance for you and I was happily surprised. The finishes are truly marvelous and follow the common thread that unites all of Mr. Gustin's little places: wood, iron, plants, and the recovery of modern-day furniture revisited and repurposed by turning everything upside down. One example? An old record player can turn into a nightstand.\nSeen that we’re talking about record players, here in every room you will find vinyls, ready to play impressive and intriguing background music. The beauty of this lies in the fact that the sound comes out of super modern speakers, resulting in a clean and crystal-clear sound.\nThe wood of the floor blends perfectly with the warm colors of the walls, from sage green tones to blue ones, to the anthracite gray that characterizes some rooms: they mix in a successful combination with the satin-black bathroom fixtures.\nIn room N1 you’ll find the private SPA consisting of a whirlpool shower and waterfall. Isn’t it crazy? What’s wonderful about this place is that no two rooms are the same, they all differ in some detail. Which is quite tasteful, I might add.\nThe hanging beds give the room a clean and essential feel, yet they still give a sense of great hospitality. A kettle and a coffee capsule machine are the common element of the rooms. Some spaces are even equipped with a hot plate, which is ideal for chefs, who never go on vacation! The courtesy kits are also very well-finished, with super-soft bathrobes 🙂\nThe finishes are refined and never mundane, as I already mentioned: designer lamps alternate with modern antique pieces, and light, white curtains complement a fitting system of interior shutters, the perfect solution for those who sleep in total darkness. As for the silence element, there’s no problem: triple-glazed window frames will not let even the slightest noise in from the busy Carducci and San Spiridione streets. Some rooms have small balconies from which to admire charming views of the city such as the Roman Theater and Piazza della Borsa.\nA parking space for the car? Again, it’s no problem here. The nearby Park San Giusto will be the ideal solution.\nThe rooms are mainly doubles, but some also have a double or single sofa bed.\nI think these shots (taken on a rainy day!) speak volumes.\nAnd now we come to the point of the article. Since this is a brand-new project, the website is not yet active. So if you want to book a room you will have to write an email to: email@example.com or resort to Booking.com by clicking here\nHow much does it cost? Obviously, it varies depending on the season. In November (which is considered low season) the room prices range between 110 and 130 euros per night for two people, a price I think is absolutely in line for a place like this.\nTo recap: you've asked for a few videos on my social medias, you have a small article with photos...I'd say you have no excuse but to go!\nFoto Michele Grimaz", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

{"id": "608", "text": "Time, order, and the ethical in the production of ethnographic knowledge\nby Nathaniel Roberts\nSince coming to Max Planck I have begun to measure my readings in inches. Today I gathered the articles I have read over the last 4 weeks; combined with the pages of hand-written notes I have taken on both readings and seminar presentations, the stack was 4.5 inches high. Without the underlinings and marginal notes I have made, these printouts would soon be useless to me. While I have a good memory for overall arguments and conclusions, the pencil markings I have made are the threads that will lead me back to the empirical details and interesting side arguments. But what to do with the stack itself? If I just pile it atop the previous months’ reading and notes I will become once again lost. The chances of finding a dimly remembered title in which some precious argument was made grows less and less certain as the stack grows ever larger. Nor is any physical filing system adequate to the task. Thematically, any documents will seem to belong equally well in at least two different files. To organize them arbitrarily by author’s surname represents only a minor improvement over the chronological stack.\nThe problem is one anyone who has conducted ethnographic fieldwork will instantly recognize. Collecting reams of data is the easy part, figuring out how to organize it so that the relevant bits can be retrieved at a later date—that is the problem. I once met a fellow anthropologist on the field who told me proudly that he had recorded 200 hours of interviews. On cassette tapes! None of it had been transcribed. He hadn’t even made notes during the interviews to tell him what each tape contained. Poor fellow. So far as I know his dissertation remains uncompleted.\nBattling my own field notes—that was how I spent the two hottest hours of the day, gnawing on caffeine pills and dripping sweat onto my notebooks, as everyone else in my slum enjoyed their midday nap. I was never entirely successful. Often I felt like the aphasiacs described in Foucault’s Order of Things who, “when shown various differently coloured skeins of wool on a table top, are consistently unable to arrange them into any coherent pattern.”1 But though I never hit upon a foolproof system for ordering my data, the consistent effort to do so bore unexpected fruit. I began to amaze slum dwellers with my apparently wizard-like power to recall the details of quotidian events from many months ago. And in the favorite slum pastime of trying to decipher the hidden meanings of other people’s actions (in a milieu where everyone was sure something was being hidden from them—why did she speak that way to her sister? why is she accusing that boy of trying to seduce her daughter when he is clearly innocent?) I became an acknowledged seer, even despite my imperfect command of the language and the fact that privacy concerns meant I could not reveal all I knew. But it was easy. For I had not only heard the same stories told from dozens of different perspectives, but was able to “remember” them in all their every detail, perceive even the tiniest inconsistencies in stories that would normally go unnoticed in the flow of events, and discern unmistakable patterns in the concatenation of minor details.\nThus I smile at the question, of perpetual interest to anthropology students and others who know fieldwork only secondhand: “As an outsider, how can you be sure you really understand the people you studied? How do you know they weren’t just saying what they thought you wanted to hear?” Of course people shape what they say to what they think you want to hear—or to what they want you to think. But what they in fact tell you is not always what they think they are telling you, and is always much more than what they say.\nIt is often said that the special knowledge claims of the fieldworker depend on the immediacy of their physical presence in the field—of having actually “been there.” While some ethnographers may have actually implied such a thing, I do not think this is an accurate or helpful description of what we do. Ethnographic knowledge, like all knowledge, is necessarily mediated. And this is no less true for the ethnographer having “been there.” Nor does the fact that it is mediated through elaborate (and inevitably) incomplete notes and other records make it any less reliable. The ethnographer’s knowledge is always partial, of course, but that is true of all knowledge. And it is also therefore true of the knowledge “natives” have of one another. To ask how an “outsider” can really understand natives is to picture culture as a bounded, internally transparent whole. Before asking how the outsider could understand natives, one should ask how natives understand each other. What we call “culture” does not involve a mystical mind-meld joining insiders but excluding others. It is itself mediated through language and through other publicly observable signs and actions. “Insider” and “outsider” are not neutral categories that simply describe positions relative to some already existing totality. They are themselves signs whose meanings are variably applied within different language games (including that of the anthropologist), and their social salience is not always what North American identity politics would predict.\nThe defining feature of anthropological knowledge is thus neither the spurious immediacy of ethnographic authority, nor the fact that it is in reality highly mediated, but the sorts of questions and concerns it addresses. That and the manner in which it is produced. As my previous comments on sweat and caffeine pills suggest, there is no golden road to science. At the same time, to be freed from the practical struggles of daily life in order to spend all one’s waking moments simply collecting and processing information is itself an immense privilege—as Pierre Bourdieu has reminded us—and one that is possibly only with serious economic backing. Thus although I lost some 20 pounds while living in the slum, this was due entirely to the rigors of fieldwork and not (unlike many of those around me) for lack of sufficient food to eat. And it is by recognizing this difference, I think, that the ethical relationship of the social scientist to those she studies, and to the world around her, is most usefully approached.\nIn the case of my own research, what this meant was attempting to build a picture, not only of these Dalit slum dwellers’ “culture,” but how that culture is produced, what it hides from view, where its fault lines lie, who it helps and who it hurts, and, perhaps most importantly, what can be said about the relations between the slum and the dominant society around it that serve to render slum dwellers so abject. To get a handle on these sorts of questions was not so easy as the parlor magic I described above—mindreading and such. It required me to work long hours, seven days a week for over a year after returning from the field: sifting through and coding data, searching out patterns, trying out one interpretation after another (only to have each bump up against some inconvenient datum, forcing me to abandon it), until finally I hit upon an explanation that really made sense to me. Writing an ethnography need not be so arduous; I recall the late Olivia Harris once advising fieldwork returnees to “write everything up as fast as possible, because it is only when you first return that you understand it all.” It all depends what you are looking for, I suppose… and not all of us possess Olivia’s intuitive ability to synthesize disparate ethnographic data. But even in the case of the fieldworker who “sees it all in an instant,” as it were, this intuitive leap should not be mistaken for immediacy. The road to instantaneous insight is always paved by many months and even years of very hard work.\n* * *\nOh, about the problem of ordering my stack of readings and handwritten notes, with which this essay began. Although the problem here is not fundamentally different from that of ordering fieldnotes, the stakes are somewhat lower; whereas all one’s field data must be accounted for, if I forget an argument in some paper I have read, this will not prevent me from forging ahead with my own arguments in quite the same way. Whenever my stack of reading and notes grows too big, I simply scan the whole batch, and store the resulting PDF files on my computer. Unlike paper files, these can be multiply indexed using keywords within a free bibliographic program like Zotero.

{"id": "612", "text": "Merike Estna has discussed and tested the limits of painting as both idea and action over a long period of time. With her expressive style, the Estonian artist unites an abstract visual language that seems to be taken from our digital age with motifs from myths and folk tales. In her work, an inviting openness converges with an understated sense of humour, examining the tradition-laden structures that have come to be associated with the medium of painting in particular.\nThe painterly medium is allowed to expand beyond frame and canvas, taking over both the exhibition space and the human body. The works occasionally function as props or objects and take the shape of benches, tables, floor or wearable items of clothing. Through social and performative elements, the viewer is coaxed into mutual, at times subtle participation.\nMerike Estna also introduces handicraft techniques, such as ceramics, into her installations. Through her choice of motifs, creative processes, materials and poetic titles, the viewer’s understanding and interpretation is led in several different directions including philosophical, political and personal dimensions.\nIn Merike Estna’s work, painting becomes a living, fluid substance with unforeseen possibilities, and where the spiritual meets the material. Her work seems to be as much about the specific medium itself as the attitude and freedom that permeates both the process and the social structures that come out of it.\nMerike Estna (b. 1980) lives in Tallinn where she is associate professor at the Estonian Academy of Arts. The exhibition at Moderna Museet Malmö is the artist’s first solo exhibition in Scandinavia.

{"id": "618", "text": "Most of the news this year has been dominated by stories about Covid-19. Because of this, some other important news either doesn’t get reported or doesn’t get much notice. One such news item appeared in late March, and it is a report that Arkansas parents need to be aware of.\nA car insurance comparison site conducted an analysis of publicly available data on teen alcohol use and driving behaviors. It then ranked 15 states based on these criteria. According to the report, Arkansas had the highest rate of teen drinking and driving among the 15 states studied.\nThe data analyzed was from 2017, which is the most recent data available. The report found that just over 25 percent of Arkansas teens anonymously surveyed admitted to drinking alcohol within the past 30 days. More worrisome was the fact that 10.7 percent of teen respondents in Arkansas admitted to having driven a car after drinking (within the previous 30 days). This is more than three times the number of adults who drove after having too much to drink (3.1 percent).\nTo be sure, it is very possible that most teens who drove after drinking were not legally drunk by adult standards (having a blood-alcohol concentration at or above 0.08 percent). However, as novice drivers, teens are already at higher risk of crashes. Driving with even small amounts of alcohol in their systems would greatly increase the risk of an injurious or fatal crash.\nAnd from a legal perspective, teens who drink and drive have a much lower threshold for legal consequences. Under Arkansas’s zero-tolerance law, any driver under the age of 21 can be charged with DWI if their BAC is at or above 0.02 percent. In some cases, that can equate to consuming a single alcoholic drink.\nIf you are the parent of a teen driver, please have a serious talk with them about the dangers – physical and legal – of drinking and driving. And if your son or daughter has been charged with underage drinking and driving, contact an experienced criminal defense attorney as soon as reasonably possible.", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}
{"id": "619", "text": "Heading to the market in Orvieto? First, you have to get there\nIn some respects, reaching Orvieto (located in the southern part of the region of Umbria, Italy) is much like visiting an island because it takes some effort to get there. The medieval walled city sits on a high plateau of volcanic ash stone (Tufa) about 1000 feet above the valley.\nAlthough you can drive up hairpin-curved roads leading to the town, the chances of finding a parking spot are iffy and all the discoveries seem to be in pedestrian-only squares and alleys. As a result, many tourists leave their cars in the public lot below and ascend a series of underground ramps, steps and escalators by foot (taking approximately 10 minutes) to reach the top.\nIn addition to being able to see all the town’s architectural, art and crafts treasures, one of the rewards of emerging from underground on a Thursday or Saturday morning is being able to visit the bustling outdoor market held in the Piazza del Popolo.\nSet on cobblestone streets, the square is anchored by the Palazzo de Popolo (The People’s Palace), a Romanesque-Gothic palace that now serves as a conference center.\nWhat you’ll find at the market in Orvieto?\nOn market days, the square and surrounding streets are filled with haphazardly arranged trucks and stands as shoppers weave their way around them. Many cooking classes for tourists also begin here with students shopping with their chefs.\nThe mix of finds at the market in Orvieto\nThis centuries-old market offers a mix of food, vestiti (clothes) and home goods.\nThe region of Umbria has been dubbed the “green heart” of Italy because it is so rich in wine and agriculture; farmers and artisanal producers from the surrounding countryside arrive at the market in Orvieto early in the morning to sell their products. They close up just in time for the lunch hour.\nLike many in Italy, the market in Orvieto is far less manicured (and costly) than those in France.\nUmbrian cooking is characterized as being simple in recipes and technique but made with outstanding ingredients. Walking through the market with all the local, seasonal food products, we only regretted that our hotel room didn’t have a kitchen.\nThe main event\nIf we had to name the one standout of this colorful market, it would have to be the truck just inside one of the alleys leading to the square that sells porchetta. Often sold in roadside stands throughout Italy, porchetta is a boneless, moist pork roast stuffed with herbs and traditionally cooked over wood.\nThe meat is usually eaten as part of a warm sandwich (panino) with a crisp piece of fatty skin adding to the savory taste. Every time we see one of the white porchetta trucks on the road, my husband lusts over this dish that is so popular with working men across the country. Because it was too early for lunch, we ordered two panini wrapped to take home to our hotel.\n- It’s always better to arrive early in the morning when the crowds are less dense.\n- Be sure to have your Italian dictionary and some knowledge of metric measurements if you are planning to purchase fruits, vegetables or nuts.\n- Cash only, of course.\nIF YOU GO\nPiazza del Popolo Market in Orvieto\nOpen Thursday and Saturday mornings from 7AM-12PM\nPreviously on MoreTimeToTravel.com\n- Public markets offer a taste of a city and its culture\n- Tips for visiting public markets\n- Great markets travel bloggers love to visit\n- Market visit – Coquimbo Fish Market in Chile\n- Market visit – Mercado 23 in Cancun, Mexico\n- Market visit – Carnot Market in Lyon, France\n- Market visit – President Wilson Market in Paris\n- Market visit – Saint Antoine Market in Lyon, France\n- Local markets make for perfect Saturday morning getaways\n- Only on Sundays – Marche des Quai", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}
{"id": "620", "text": "For those of you who know me, you know I’m an audio nut, I guess that’s what happens after spending almost a decade at Sonos. Yes, I have more speakers in my house than rooms and more headphones than devices to plug them into. Along with loving music and listening to it just about every minute of the day (yes we have Sonos all over our office too!) I also love good sound for movie and tv shows.\nBut I have something to admit that seems to baffle most of my friends, it doesn’t bug me that Apple removed the headphone jack from their new iPhone. I pre-ordered the iPhone, can’t wait to get it, and don’t think my life is going to be a complicated mess in any way in the absence of a 3.5 mm headphone jack.\nAcross the Interwebs the removal of the headphone jack definitely struck a nerve, here are some examples:\nEither way, the burden was decidedly on Apple to convince users that they wouldn’t miss the headphone jack. And now that we’re a few days removed from the event, we can calmly ask: did Apple adequately justify its decision to remove the headphone jack?\nUnfortunately, the answer to that question is resounding no.\n(Source – BGR)\nWhile it’s tough to make the case that dropping the headphone jack is better for consumers, the benefits for Apple are much easier to see. The iPhone 7 will be bought by tens of millions of people during the next few months alone, and its lack of a headphone jack is going to make many of them consider buying Lightning or Bluetooth headphones. Apple profits from both. (Source – The Verge)\nApple’s iPhone 7 has no headphone jack.\nInstead, Apple wants people to use its proprietary Lightning connector to attach headphones — or, better yet, to buy Apple’s new $160 wireless AirPods.\nIf that sounds like a major frustration to you, don’t worry — there’s a very silly-looking dongle that you can plug into your phone so that standard headphones will work. (Source – Business Insider)\nSo why I am not grabbing my pitchfork and heading for Cupertino? To be honest with you there are three simple reasons why this doesn’t but me at all, and sorry in advance if my reasoning bugs you but here they are:\n- I actually think it will drive innovation and move consumers towards wireless headphones faster. While the act of a removing the headphone jack from a device isn’t innovative, the fact that it got so many people talking about it and thinking about wireless headphones I do think will move consumers away from wired and into wireless faster. Wired headphones have been around for 100+ years, wireless is quickly becoming the norm and the more we can thrust it into the focal point of conversation the faster that transition will take place. Yes, Apple as the owner of Beats headphones and a newly minted “expensive” set of earbuds will benefit in the process but let’s be realistic, there are a zillion other companies that make wireless headphones and the iPhone 7 works with all of them.\n- I do think that Apple will benefit from having more space for hardware inside the iPhone 7 chassis. As someone that spent a great deal of time with microelectronics (I’m an Electrical and Computer Engineering Major) I know that every millimeter of space counts. Simply put, the headphone jack took up space, and without it there’s more space for other more innovative/useful things inside the chassis.\n- The audio quality through the lightning port is higher quality. Like I said, I’m an audio nut, and I like great sound quality, so connecting my wired headphones to a port that provides for higher sound quality is a-okay by me.\nAlso, just one last point and then I’m done here…Apple does include a free dongle that you can use to still plug wired headphones into the iPhone 7 so it won’t cost anyone a penny more to listen to their current wired headphones.\nSo that’s my two cents, what do you think?

{"id": "621", "text": "ALBANY — The Grow NY Farms Coalition has announced that the New York State Association of Counties (NYSAC) is in support of maintaining the current overtime threshold at 60 hours for family farms across the Empire State.\nDuring their 2022 Legislative Conference in Albany, which took place March 14-16, NYSAC passed a resolution affirming the group’s support of the current 60-hour overtime threshold.\nNYS Association of Counties President and Tioga County Chair Martha Sauerbrey said, “New York’s counties are proud to stand with the family farmers and farmworkers who produce the food that fills our grocery store shelves, our school cafeterias and local foodbanks in opposing this change to the overtime threshold. We need to be doing everything we can to support our local farmers as they confront challenges from increasingly erratic weather and rising costs of feed and fuel, not adding additional burdens that threaten their ability to feed our communities and power local economies.”\nNYS County Executives Association President and Dutchess County Executive Marc Molinaro said, “New York’s counties have sent a clear message that we cannot let our farmers and farmworkers lose income, hours, or the ability to continue providing local milk and food to our communities. These multi-generational family-run businesses are essential, and can’t stand by and allow them to go out of business, while their employees leave to work more hours in competing states. Nourish NY, food pantries, local grocery stores, school districts – all of our programs and food hubs depend on our local supply chain. Any reduction in the overtime threshold will only put family farms and New York’s food security at risk.”\nNY Farm Bureau Vice President, and Partner at A. Ooms & Sons Dairy Farm in Columbia County, Eric Ooms said, “New York State’s county leaders have made their voices heard, and we hope that Governor Kathy Hochul is listening. We’re grateful for NYSAC’s support and partnership as we continue to advocate for the viability of New York’s farms and protection of the state’s local food supply. We cannot ignore the more than 70% of participants who asked to maintain the threshold during Farm Laborers Wage Board hearings. University researchers, industry experts, local and state officials, in addition to farmers and farmworkers, have asked to keep the threshold at 60. If we want to protect these family businesses for the next generation of farmers and farmworkers, the threshold must remain at 60 hours.”\nNortheast Dairy Producers Association Chair, and Partner at Ideal Dairy Farms in Washington County, John Dickinson said, “Now is not the time to increase costs for an industry that cannot pass these increases on to consumers. Family farms are having to decide between filling the tractor’s diesel tank at more than $5 a gallon to start planting in the fields, or purchasing feed for their herd which has also skyrocketed over the past year. Any reduction in the overtime threshold is a lose-lose – for our employees, the Nourish NY program, the diversity of the state’s agriculture industry, and the viability of the future of farming in the Empire State. We’re asking Governor Hochul to stay at 60.”\nNew York State Vegetable Growers Association President, and Partner at Reeves Farm in Onondaga County, Brian Reeves said, “Our employees want to work. They understand the need to plant and harvest when Mother Nature allows, and they have a passion for caring for the land, each other, and the fresh produce that results from all our preparation, efforts, and teamwork. Unfortunately, farms are already feeling the unintended consequences of the 60-hour threshold, as employees choose to work for our competitors in order to get the hours they’re looking for. At the same time, our margins are increasingly razor-thin and we’re unable to donate as much food as we used to. If we have any chance at retaining our skilled workforce and continuing to provide to our neighbors and families across the state, Governor Hochul must keep the overtime threshold at 60.”\nClick here to view the resolution online, found on page 14.\nThe Resolution Supporting Maintaining the 60-Hour Work Week for Farm Workers:\nWHEREAS, agriculture is New York State’s largest industry; and\nWHEREAS, the Farm Laborers Wage Board has proposed to lower the farm labor overtime threshold from 60 to 40 hours; and\nWHEREAS, farmers are critical components of our regional economy and are necessary to ensure supermarkets are stocked with food; and\nWHEREAS, New York State is frequently number two in the nation for agricultural products in pounds donated to foodbanks, including the Nourish New York program; and\nWHEREAS, donations of New York-grown products would be negatively impacted as a result of lowering the overtime threshold for farm workers; and\nWHEREAS, from the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic, farmers have stepped up and ensured their operations continued and were responsible for donating thousands of pounds of food to local food banks at a time of significant need; and\nWHEREAS, New York farmers face a tremendous number of challenges outside of their control, including changes in consumer demand leading to price changes, obtaining labor, climate change, land management policies, foreign market competition, and livestock and crop disease; and\nWHEREAS, in addition to the practical issues related to growing and selling food products, New York farmers must contend with government regulations, including changes in wages and overtime threshold; and\nWHEREAS, New York grown agricultural products would be at a competitive disadvantage in neighboring states as a result of increased labor costs associated with lowering the overtime threshold for farm workers; and\nWHEREAS, since the adoption of the 2019 Farm Laborers Fair Practice Act, one of the more pressing issues for the farming community has been mandated overtime requirements which currently grant farmworkers a right to overtime after sixty (60) hours of work each week; and\nWHEREAS, New York farmers are reliant on migratory work forces during New York’s short growing season, as workers are here for only a few months in the spring and summer and have limited hours each year to get the work done; and\nWHEREAS, the Act does not prohibit the wage board from arbitrarily decreasing the overtime threshold again, further increasing costs on local farms and their use of seasonal workers; and\nWHEREAS, the provisions of the Act would negatively impact the farming community by either increasing costs for farmers, who are operating under very tight margins, or will cut into work opportunities for migratory workers and the intended beneficiaries of overtime wages; and\nWHEREAS, cutting budgeted support levels and drastically increasing costs through government interference should be avoided whenever possible; and\nWHEREAS, together farmworkers and farmers oppose the overtime threshold limit, with 70 percent of all testimony opposing any change and most of the testimony provided in the hearing process requesting “NO CHANGE” to the overtime threshold.\nNOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, the New York State Association of Counties (NYSAC) hereby supports the farmers and migrant workers who do not want their hours reduced; and\nBE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that NYSAC hereby supports maintaining the 60-hour work week for farmers and recommends stopping the implementation of a reduction in the farm labor overtime threshold; and\nBE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that copies of this resolution be sent to the counties of New York State encouraging member counties to enact similar resolutions; and\nBE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that NYSAC shall forward copies of this resolution to Governor Kathy Hochul, the New York State Legislature, the Commissioner of Agriculture and Markets, and all others deemed necessary and proper.\nVisit GrowNYFarms.com to learn why family farms and farmworkers are asking Governor Kathy Hochul to #StayAt60.

In October 2019, the BAuA last published the three extended leading characteristic methods \"LMM-HHT\", \"LMM-ZS\" and \"LMM-MA\" and additionally the three new leading characteristic methods \"LMM-GK\", \"LMM-KB\" and \"LMM-KH\".\nThe digital Key Indicator Method was developed to meet the requirements of the load handling regulation and to be able to organize the activities of the employees in a way that is suitable for humans.\nThe digital Key Indicator Method enables an evaluation of the risk in the case of physical stress while manual movements such as lifting or carrying loads, pulling and pushing loads or similar are carried out in the work process.\nFinally, the evaluation of the individual sub-activities is carried out from the assessment of the determined key characteristics on the basis of a characteristic value and the determination of the weightings of the key characteristics, after the final multiplication with the time weighting.\nHidden optimization potentials are uncovered within the scope of Motion-Mining® ergonomics analyses. The solution approach allows an evaluation of manual work, specifically the posture, and movement of employees, using wearables and a deep learning algorithm, better known as artificial intelligence. Work processes are automatically and anonymously recorded, processed by artificial intelligence, and converted into key performance indicators. Currently, we distinguish between more than 60 different movement sequences in our ergonomics analyses. Critical movements such as bending from the back, carrying, lifting, holding, overhead activities are considered in the ergonomics analysis. These movements are recorded in movement intervals, during the ergonomics analysis. In addition to the typical movements, vibrations and repetitions in particular can also be detected. Based on the data from the ergonomics analysis, overloads and permanent stresses can be identified and measures to avoid them can be derived. Methods such as EAWS are used as part of these analyses.\nOn average, the physical resilience of men is about 2/3 that of women. This difference between women and men is primarily due to a wide variety of factors, including different body proportions. In order that, for example, these factors can also be included in physically demanding activities for preventive health reasons, the weighting of loads in the manual lifting, holding and carrying of loads (LMM-HHT) Key Indicator Method is surveyed separately for men and women according to the corresponding LMM table; with the same load weighting, women receive a higher rating. On the other hand, different multipliers apply to the various leading characteristic methods to compensate for the given differences, e.g. LMM-ZS: the intermediate score for men, is multiplied by a factor of 1.3 for women.\nThe digital Key Indicator Method for the ergonomic assessment and evaluation of workplaces and processes makes it possible to provide a precise, generally understandable explanation of the strain on employees at specific workplaces with comparatively little effort. The digital Key Indicator Method offers improvement approaches that can be derived directly from the collected data in order to integrate them into one's own work planning at an early stage.\nThese methods, although initially conceived as analog versions, can now also be carried out and used in digital form (digital Key Indicator Method). Implemented with the latest software development tools, EAWS-digital, for example, can record and evaluate all the information required for the process in a simple and intuitive way.\nHuman simulation (digital human models) is also used in planning for the digital factory to clarify and scrutinize manual activities in 3D as early as the planning phase. In planning, simulation is used to assess manual tasks both in terms of time economy (MTM process modules) and ergonomics (EAWS process). Human simulation for the investigation and optimization of assembly processes, time expenditure, and ergonomics is thus increasingly finding its way into everyday operations.\nFor example, increasing economic competition worldwide and declining population growth in Europe is forcing the economic design of workplaces and process flows to include human performance. A corresponding ergonomic instrument is EAWS (Ergonomic Assessment Worksheet), which includes all stages of the life cycle of goods (developed by MTM and IAD). In cooperation with well-known European companies as users of EAWS, a continuous improvement of the ergonomic assessment takes place. EAWS can be used to optimize the ergonomics assessment with regard to posture, handling forces, manual load handling, load frequencies for the upper limb areas, e.g. in the form of the EAWS quick analysis or the automatic determination of movement data and forces (motion capturing). EAWS ensures precise determination of the holistic stress at the workplace to achieve ergonomic design quality for permanently healthy and productive work.\nThe demands on the industry are increasing due to progressive globalization and increasing digitalization. In order for the industry to keep up and hold its own in global and national competition in the future, it needs innovative approaches to solutions, such as the EAWS method, and continuous adaptation.\nBy using EAWS, the physical loads on the body as well as the upper extremities at the respective workplace can be determined. Based on the understanding gained through the EAWS method, workplaces can be ergonomically designed as a whole.\nSeamlessly integrate our Motion-Mining® hardware into your work processes to capture activity and motion data from your employees and vehicles.

Or you could actually further your film career by listening to a movie-centric podcast.\nWhether you’re into screenwriting, cinematography or special effects (or all three), there’s a podcast suited to your interests. So look upon this list of 10 great podcasts—all of which are available on iTunes—as a starting place. After all, it’s better than sleeping on the subway. People could steal your shoes.\nwww.slashfilm.com/filmcast • /Filmcast snags some pretty big-name directors as guests, including recent episodes with Scott Cooper (Crazy Heart) and James Cameron (do we really need to list his filmography?). In addition to /Filmcast is /Filmcast: After Dark, where the hosts discuss totally unique film-related issues, such as whether DVD special features can be too good and the ethics of theater seat-saving.\nwww.battleshippretension.com • In addition to having arguably the best name of any film podcast out there, Battleship Pretension hosts Tyler Smith and David Bax really know their movies. In a far-reaching discussion of Shakespeare film adaptations they easily move from voicing controversial opinions on Laurence Olivier to the Macbeth adaptation Scotland, Pa., in which the characters fight over a fast food restaurant. The tone of the podcast makes it a really fun listen, too; put perfectly by the podcast’s press kit, BP “approximates the type of laid-back, free-flowing conversation had by lovers of film around the world.”\nwww.creativescreenwriting.com/podcasts/main.html • This companion podcast to Creative Screenwriting sees senior editor Jeff Goldsmith interviewing such scribes as Oscar-winner Mark Boal (The Hurt Locker) and Michael Haneke (The White Ribbon). Gain insight into how some of the most successful screenwriters of today tackle their assignments—whether it’s adapting an existing work (as in the case of Joe Penhall and John Hillcoat, the respective writer and director of The Road) or coming up with new material.\nwww.directorsnotes.com • With the tagline “The What, How & Why of Independent Filmmaking,” Directors Notes doesn’t focus on huge Hollywood blockbusters. Nope, there’s no talk of the latest Michael Bay actionfest here. Instead, independent moviemakers are interviewed about their craft and how they saw their ideas through from conception to production. What makes this podcast unique is that while one episode may feature an interview with a moviemaker, another could feature clips from the film being discussed, so the audience won’t be in the dark if they haven’t seen the film in question.\nwww.film-method.com • Film Method’s first season was devoted to all things development, from networking to financing to cultivating the director-producer relationship. Now it’s well into season two: Pre-production. Featuring interviews with production designers, script supervisors, assistant directors and cinematographers about what their jobs entail and how pre-production should go, Film Method is a valuable resource for moviemakers who want to jump into the moviemaking business with some idea of how to actually, you know, make a movie.\nwww.revision3.com/filmriot • Okay, so I’m kind of cheating on this one: Film Riot is as much a sketch comedy show as it is a lesson in moviemaking—an unlikely combination, true, but one that totally works. As funny as the podcast is, it actually does have useful information for aspiring auteurs, including tips on how to make a believable alien hand and how to make it look like it’s snowing. Another episode offers reviews on cameras that cost under $1,000. Each podcast is relatively short (even with the commercials), making it ideal for a quick lunch break fix.\nwww.filmspotting.net • Each edition of Filmspotting is full of film reviews that really make you think. It doesn’t hurt that hosts Adam Kempenaar and Matty Robinson make the podcast fun to listen to—after all, what’s the point of listening to a podcast if it makes your mind go numb? Top five lists cooked up by the hosts include “Worst Date Movies” (Adam: The White Ribbon; Matty: Antichrist) and “Most Overrated Movie of 2009” (Both: Avatar).\nwww.ifc.com/news/podcast • Hosts Alison Willmore and Matt Singer know a little something about film. They compile lists of films that fall into certain, uber-specific categories. For example, one episode sees Willmore and Singer discussing “Evil Twins, Doubles and Doppelgangers” (the title of the episode), including examples from films as diverse as Mulholland Dr., Psycho II and Spider-Man 3. Other episodes cover subjects like stop motion animation and guilty pleasure movies from the past decade (just to relieve the suspense, yes, American Dreamz does make the cut).\nOn the Page\nwww.onthepage.tv • As the host of On the Page, screenwriting consultant Pilar Alessandra brings in a variety of writers and screenwriting instructors to give useful tips on how to get your ideas… wait for it… on the page.

The mediation is a voluntary collaborative process where the parties in a conflict meet together with the help of an independent mediator in order to discuss the issues, develop options, consider alternatives, and negotiate a consensual agreement or settlement.\nIn parallel, the local communities receive legal advice and training from Legal Aid Cambodia to ensure that discussions with the company can take place on an equal footing.\nThe conflict between SOCFIN-KCD and the local communities from Busra is the result of the allocation of two Economic Land Concessions (ELCs) by the government to SOCFIN-KCD since 2007-08 without acknowledging the rights of the local indigenous communities who were affected in multiple ways by the investment. After years of various attempts to compensate the local villagers and solve their grievances, the company and five communities have agreed to use the mediation to try to sole the remaining issues in a systematic manner. One of the expectations of these communities is that with the conflict resolved, they will be able to apply for the registration of their land under a community land title, and thus secure their land tenure.\nMid 2020 will mark one important step in the mediation with the signing ceremony of an agreement between SOCFIN-KCD and the communities that will settle all claims regarding the recognition of the community rights over remaining communal lands and set the final compensations related to communal lands that have been lost through the development of the plantation.

The Murthy Law Firm was a proud sponsor of this April 11th event, attended by founder and president, Sheela Murthy, attended along with a large contingent of attorneys from our firm.\nThis year’s honorees include:\n- Shireen Alihaji, the daughter of Iranian and Ecuadorian parents, now a Los Angeles filmmaker and musician, whose work explores immigrant perspectives and aims at universal understanding.\n- Suamhirs Rivera, a native of Honduras who was brought to America as a teenager, by human traffickers, and who has become a prominent advocate for abused and traumatized children.\n- Cristeta Comerford, who started her culinary career in the United States after emigrating from the Philippines, and worked her way up the ranks to become Executive Chef at the White House.\n- General Colin Powell, the son of Jamaican immigrants, who has served his country for more than 50 years in several high-profile military and diplomatic positions: his appointment as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff capped a 35-year military career. He served as U.S. Secretary of State under President George W. Bush from 2001 to 2005.\nIn a moving tribute to his immigrant parents, General Powell recounted some of the important lessons they imparted, lessons he took to heart: always work hard, and never – ever – bring shame upon yourself or your family. Looking back, General Powell said, he still finds it remarkable to have ascended the pinnacles of power as the son of immigrants, a public school graduate without family wealth or connections or elite schooling to boost his prospects. And yet, he said, in making this climb, he had a special advantage: the values instilled by his parents and his immigrant neighbors in the Harlem of the 1940s and 50s. These uplifting lessons carried him to the exalted rank of four-star General, and to the most important position in the President’s cabinet: Secretary of State.\nAll the honorees spoke eloquently about their immigrant roots. Their stories testified to the immigrant values that continue to build this nation, and to the unique opportunities our country holds for those who work hard and play by the rules. The common thread? The honorees shared an “attitude of gratitude” for the chance to succeed here – for all the things they never could have achieved in the old country.

Like some beast of legend, people have sought me out, marvelled at me, admired me […]\nIn the 19th century, Wilhelm Hauff was a kind of superstar on the literary scene. He’d become one of German literature’s classic authors. His novel “Lichtenstein” was a major hit, yet it was outperformed by his novellas “The Man in the Moon” or “From the Memoirs of Satan”. However, his fairy tales made less of a splash back then.\nIn the 20th century, attitudes changed. To put it in somewhat polemical terms: Wilhelm Hauff – wasn’t that the chap who wrote all those fairy tales? Swabia’s answer to the Thousand and One Nights. While his novels and novellas are only rarely read these days, most people are probably familiar with his fairy tales: The History of Caliph Stork. Little Muck. Or Long-Nose the Dwarf. The stories are about being an outsider and being different, about tolerance and respect for others. Themes that have lost none of their topical relevance.\nMuch like A Thousand and One Nights, Hauff’s fairy tales are embedded within a frame narrative. They were published in his Fairy Tale Almanac – a three-volume collection. Here’s what Hauff himself had to say about the almanac:\nIt is intended for girls or boys of twelve to fifteen years of age, and offers seven fairy tales appropriate for that age, mostly in the oriental style. I have attempted to make them as interesting as possible, while always ensuring that they observe a strictly moral attitude, yet without allowing the tales to boil down to a practical application or “fabula docet”.\nAs a poet, Hauff knew his target audience well. During his time as a tutor, he’d taught the sons of Ernst Eugen, Baron von Hügel, the Württemberg minister of war. Hauff fondly nicknamed his pupils “sea lions”. He wrote his first fairy tales for them.\nAnd now?

{"id": "642", "text": "A vital charity who work with young people experiencing emotional, physical or sexual abuse have been fighting exploitation in Harrow for 10 years. We discover how the expansion of internet use and cultural barriers are presenting the latest challenges in keeping teenagers safe.\nFor parents, the challenge to safeguard their children is ever increasing as social media opens the door into a world of potential exploitation and abuse.\nOf course, the traditional hurdles that can lead teenagers into danger, self-harm – or even to feel suicidal – still exist: isolation, the breakdown of a family, crime and stress, however the WISH Centre's director Rowena Jaber and her dedicated team have had to adapt to the challenges of the new age in their 10 years of working in Harrow.\nThe charity, based in Peel Road, Wealdstone, works with 200 young people every year face to face who are struggling to cope, and have seen the landscape change first hand.\nRowena recounts several instances of young people being pressured into performing sex acts which are filmed on a phone and then used to blackmail them in what becomes a cycle of abuse. The tragedy: Many of the teenagers which come to WISH for help are girls aged 13 to 15, referred to the charity by their school and in a constant fear of being shamed.\nMuch of what WISH do is try to understand the ways in which young people use the internet as a way of engaging in preventative work which they feel many parents are not always capable of doing.\n\"I think parents do not have a clue about how their children are using the internet,\" Rowena said. \"Kids and teens may be high achievers and do well in school, but when they're upstairs in their room on their laptop they could be doing anything online. That is what we here try to do: keep up with the vehicles that they are using in their lives.\"\nThe core message WISH want to convey to parents is to communicate with your children, because studies they have carried out in the streets of Harrow and Wealdstone have produced concerning evidence.\nThe data, taken this year, showed that 64 per cent know of young people know someone who has met up with someone they know on the internet, and 39 per cent know someone who has been pressured to pose in a sexual manner.\nWISH's lead practitioner for sexual violence, Matilda De Santis, explained: \"When young people do this, they are leaning on sexual attention as a validation and they do not know what to look for in identifying a threat until it is too late. Sometimes, they are not even aware it is happening and they do not know it is abuse.\"\nA primary concern to WISH is that they believe from their work that the cultural make up of Harrow is struggling to reconcile itself with these latest challenges.\n\"The big thing in the media now is that it is Asian men are targeting white girls. In Harrow, it is a different story,\" Rowena added. \"Here you have Asian men targeting Asian girls, because they know and understand the culture, they know how to pressurise and manipulate them into doing what they do not want to do.\"\nRowena's message to parents is to actively communicate with children on the problems in their lives, because there is too much at stake to let them being exposed to a cycle of exploitation.\n\"It's about them not being aware that by their children doing well in school and having a good family with a respect for their cultural values and history, they are also a part of teenage culture and the pressures that come along with that.\n\"Sexual abuse is a taboo subject among the Asian community really. Their community needs to start thinking about this issue and recognising that many of these problems stem from young men in their own community.\"\nWISH are funded through donations from Children in Need, Sport Relief and are launching an awareness campaign called Harrow Shield through funding they have received from the Mayor of London.\nFor more information, visit www.thewishcentre.org.uk.", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}

Their Big Dog saw him first, and – like Big Dogs do – growled and looked quite imposing. His only mistake was – like the rest of us, I suppose – thinking Billy Idol didn’t care. Right as I told the neighbors not to worry about Billy Idol, he launched himself through the air and landed – all four feet first – on Big Dog’s face. Needless to say, chaos ensued.\nPoint being – sometimes you’re the Big Dog, sometimes you’re the small cat and sometimes you’re the small cat named Billy Idol.\nAll-Louisiana Top 12\n#1 Southeastern Lions (20-6)\nMeet the new big dogs of our Top 12…some cats from Hammond. The Lions are ripping through everyone in their path, as the team has won 14 games in a row – the school’s longest win streak. This past week, the team followed two shutout victories, by posting 18 or more runs in their next two contests. The Lions are set to terrorize Nicholls State this weekend, and then head to the Crescent City for a major clash with Tulane next Tuesday.\n#2 Tulane Green Wave (18-7)\nSpeaking of which, the Green Wave knocked a big dog off their shoulder this week, as Tulane beat LSU, 7-1, in Baton Rouge for the first time in nine years. The game included this Play of the Year candidate by Stephen Alemais. Tulane has won six games in a row, thanks, in part, to an improving relief pitching staff (which now includes the surprising addition of Jeremy Montalbano). Major props to freshman pitching ace, Ross Massey, who has been lights out, sporting an ERA of 1.14.\n#3 LSU Tigers (16-8)\nExpectations can be rough, and expectations not met can be downright brutal. There is a lot of handwringing and “whoa-as-me” coming out of Baton Rouge right now, as the young Tigers dropped a series in College Station, and then of course got beat by Tulane in Alex Box stadium. The problem is that the bats have disappeared, and the fan base doesn’t seem to be in the mood to wait for the team to find them.\n#4 New Orleans Privateers (17-8)\nUNO is facing its first crossroads of the season – are they a Big Dog or little cat, the rest of the way? The Privateers suffered through their first bitter weekend series, getting swept by Lamar. My money is on more success coming from Coach Dean’s team. Either way, UNO sports fan, always remember…this team’s combined record over the previous three seasons is 32-122.\n#5 UL-Lafayette Ragin’ Cajuns (16-9)\nLove the name, but not loving what I’m seeing from the team. We’re just too far into the season for them to be this average. The Cajuns are running out of opportunities for big non-conference wins, and recently lost a conference series to Arkansas-Little Rock (12-12). Their win over Rice in Minute Maid Park seems like it happened years ago.\n#6 Louisiana Tech Bulldogs (14-7)\nThe only actual dogs on our list have had a solid campaign. Two early victories over Top 25 teams set the pace, and although its slowed down a touch, the Bulldogs have won five of their last six – including a conference series win over Charlotte, a team that was looking down at the Bulldogs in Conference USA’s preseason poll – a poll which had the Bulldogs finishing next to last.\n#7 McNeese State Cowboys (13-9)\nThe Cowboys swept through Abilene Christian in impressive fashion, and have won five of their last six. In related news, I met a former baseball player from McNeese State at Ancora Pizza on Freret last week. We talked about baseball, and, as always I pretended to listen as he told me about the menu. He was a cool dude, and the Neapolitan-style pizza was superb.\n#8 Northwestern State Demons (14-11)\nThe only All-Louisiana baseball team cool enough to rock a bifurcated tail and forked tongue hasn’t been setting the conference aflame lately. The Demons were picked to challenge Southeastern for the Southland conference title, but the two teams seem to be on different levels so far.\n#9 Nicholls State Colonels (11-15)\nWhile their 5-4 victory over South Alabama (18-7) is encouraging, the Thibodaux posse must still be scratching their heads over the team’s 2-7 start in the Southland conference. And next up? The Southeastern Lions. Gulp.\n#10 UL-Monroe Warhawks (10-15)\nEvery time I say this team’s name, I follow it with an awesome impersonation of an Eagle’s cry.\n#11 Grambling State Tigers (10-14)\nThe only All-Louisiana baseball school too cool to ever update their schedule with scores, which I assume the school paid for that website, so that seems like a waste of tax dollars, to which I say…Thanks Bobby Jindal.\n#12 Southern University Jaguars (8-14)\nThis team is starting to put some wins together. The Jaguars play a series against SWAC-rival Texas Southern, before heading across town to play LSU next week. A game that, if the Jaguars win, will make the LSU fan base’s collective minds melt.\nWhich is exactly what happened to that Big Dog, and my neighbors, that night in East Austin.

{"id": "652", "text": "After more than 18 months of travel restrictions and disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the United States has substantially revised its approach and will no longer restrict entry into the United States based on geography. Effective November 8, 2021, the COVID-19-related travel bans have been replaced by vaccination and testing requirements without regard to physical presence in a particular region or country.\nDespite these less restrictive entry requirements, international travel still poses risks. Due to the limited availability of visa appointments, we continue to advise caution regarding international travel for those who must apply for a visa before returning to the United States. Everyone considering international travel is urged to carefully consider the risks and be fully aware of how ongoing conditions may impact travel.\nThe official Presidential Proclamation making this change can be found here. This new Proclamation relies on U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (“CDC”) guidance for vaccination and negative testing criteria as referenced in the links below.\nThe CDC’s general page for COVID-19 exposure related to travel can be found here.\nThere is also a helpful CDC document with technical instructions to airlines that can be found here.\nThis new Proclamation revamps restrictions for “noncitizen nonimmigrant” international travelers entering the United States. Travel guidance is already in place for U.S. citizens and permanent residents and remains unchanged. The new policy replaces the country-specific travel bans with a policy that applies to virtually all nonimmigrant individuals, regardless of country of origin or physical presence. In exchange for country-specific bans, this new policy will be based on vaccination status and testing negative for COVID-19.\nVaccination Required for Nonimmigrant Travelers\nBeginning November 8, 2021, all nonimmigrant travelers entering the U.S. must be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 in order to board U.S.–bound flights. In limited situations, unvaccinated nonimmigrant travelers may still enter the U.S., but they must meet certain exception criteria and comply with additional restrictions. The new Proclamation’s general rule is that unvaccinated nonimmigrants are not permitted to enter the U.S.\nVaccines accepted for travel to the U.S. are listed on the CDC website and currently include:\nThe exceptions permitting unvaccinated nonimmigrants to enter the U.S. include the following groups:\n- Persons on diplomatic or official foreign government travel\n- Children under age 18\n- Those with documented medical contraindications for receiving a vaccination;\n- Participants in certain COVID-19 vaccine trials\n- Those issued a humanitarian or emergency exception (This category must obtain approval from the U.S. Embassy or Consulate in advance of travel)\n- Those entering on valid visas (other than visitors for business or tourism) from countries with limited vaccine availability\n- Members of the U.S. Armed Forces and their spouses and children\n- Crew members traveling by sea and certain air crew members\n- Others whose entry is in the national interest of the U.S.\nThe vaccine-excepted categories are only those listed above. The prior exemptions to the geographic travel ban for certain family members of U.S. citizens and permanent residences, for instance, do not apply.\nThe CDC Technical Instructions provide details of the documentation required to demonstrate eligibility for each exception category. Those who travel by air to the United States under one of these exceptions will also be required to attest that they are excepted from the requirement to present proof of vaccination. Based on the category of the exception, they may further be required to attest that:\n- They will be tested with a COVID-19viral test 3-5 days after arrival in the United States, unless they have documentation of having recovered from COVID-19 in the past 90 days;\n- They will self-quarantine for a full 7 days, even if the test result to the post-arrival viral test is negative, unless they have documentation of having recovered from COVID-19 in the past 90 days; and\n- They will self-isolate if the result of the post-arrival test is positive or if they develop COVID-19 symptoms.\nBased on the category of the exception, those intending to stay in the United States for longer than 60 days may also be required to attest that:\n- They agree to be vaccinated against COVID-19; and\n- They have arranged to become fully vaccinated against COVID-19 within 60 days of arriving in the United States, or as soon thereafter as is medically appropriate, unless (for children) they are too young to be vaccinated.\nThe CDC website includes a helpful Travel Assessment that indicates travel requirements in response to individualized responses, which can be accessed here.\nNegative COVID-19 Test Result Required for All Air Travelers\nIn addition to the vaccination requirements replacing the geographic restrictions, all international air passengers destined for the United States continue to be required to provide a negative COVID-19 test result in order to board U.S.–bound flights. As an alternative to a negative COVID-19 test result, international travelers may present documentation of recovery from COVID-19, including a positive viral test result within 90 days and letter from a health care provider or public health official clearing them for travel. All passengers must present the negative test result or proof of recovery from COVID-19 before boarding the flight.\nFor vaccinated travelers, the viral test must be on a specimen collected no more than 3 calendar days before the departure of the passenger’s U.S.–bound flight. Unvaccinated travelers must present a negative viral test result for a specimen collected no more than 1 calendar day before the departure of the passenger’s U.S.–bound flight. Note that parents traveling with children may have different testing timeline requirements based on differing vaccination status.\nTesting requirements have been in place since January 2021, and apply to all air passengers traveling to the United States, 2 years of age or older, including U.S. citizens and legal permanent residents.\nReopening of Canada and Mexico Land Borders\nTravel restrictions across the U.S. borders with Canada and Mexico, which barred U.S. entry of nonimmigrants for travel considered “non-essential,” are also being eased. Effective November 8, 2021, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) will begin allowing fully vaccinated travelers from Mexico or Canada to enter the United States at land and ferry ports of entry (POEs) for non-essential reasons. Travelers will be required to have appropriate paperwork that provides proof of vaccination. Individuals who have not been fully vaccinated for COVID-19 will not be allowed to travel for non-essential purposes from Canada and Mexico into the United States via land and ferry POEs. Entry into the U.S. on a work visa has generally been considered “essential” travel and has not been restricted.\nBeginning in January 2022, all inbound foreign national travelers crossing into the U.S. from Canada or Mexico via land or ferry ports of entry — whether for essential or non-essential reasons — must be fully vaccinated for COVID-19 and provide proof of vaccination. This delayed implementation is intended to provide ample time for essential travelers such as truckers, students, and health care workers to get vaccinated.\nThere is no information suggesting that there will be any exceptions to the new vaccination requirements. However, note that this change applies only to entry through land or ferry ports. Air travel from Canada and Mexico would follow the vaccination guidelines for worldwide U.S.–bound air travel detailed above.\nVisa Processing Remains Limited\nThe lifting of geographically focused travel restrictions will substantially ease international travel, but challenges will remain. For those who do not have a valid visa for return to the U.S., either because their status was changed in the U.S. or a prior visa has expired, obtaining a new visa may still prove difficult. Some consular posts are simply not scheduling routine visa appointments, and others are allowing appointments to be scheduled — sometimes months in the future — only to cancel them. From a practical standpoint, unless one is likely to qualify for an emergency or expedited visa appointment, there is a good chance that a new visa appointment will be difficult to schedule. Individuals eligible to have the in-person visa appointment waived stand the best chance of securing visas by submitting application documents to the U.S. Embassy through drop box or courier services. Each consular post determines the criteria for a waiver of the interview requirement. At a minimum, typically, the consular post requires that the individual have already been granted a visa in the same classification.\nThose who need to obtain a new nonimmigrant visa should verify the status of visa processing operations at the consular post where they will apply.\nEntry into the U.S.\nIn addition to the COVID-19 vaccination and test requirements, when entering the U.S. following international travel, foreign nationals should be prepared to answer questions from a Customs and Border Protection officer regarding the nature of proposed entry and qualifications for a designated waiver or exemption. All foreign nationals should carry documentation evidencing status as well as any documentation supporting the individual’s specific exemption from the vaccination requirement. Visit the Mintz Resources page here for details on required documents for travel.\nFollowing entry into the U.S., it is critical for individuals to check the I-94 admission record to ensure that it properly reflects their status and authorized stay in the U.S. We recommend verifying the accuracy of Form I-94 details within 48 hours of entering the U.S. in order to correct any errors in a timely manner.", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}

{"id": "655", "text": "INDIANAPOLIS — It’s a dream scenario that makes way too much sense: Ohio State wide receiver Chris Olave is available with the No. 39 overall pick and the Bears pair him with his former college quarterback, Justin Fields.\nAnd it’s something Olave would welcome.\n“Oh yeah, definitely,” he said Wednesday at the NFL Combine. “Having him in college as my quarterback, I know what he can do on-and-off the field and I know how hard he works. I feel like we're very similar in ways and I feel like we can complement each other if we do end up on the same team.”\nStay in the game with the latest updates on your beloved Chicago sports teams! Sign up here for our All Access Daily newsletter.\nThe tape from Ohio State backs that up. They were a deadly duo, with Olave racking up 98 catches for 1,569 yards and 19 touchdowns in 20 games with Fields as his quarterback.\nThe Bears need a wide receiver like Olave, but recreating a Joe Burrow-Ja’Marr Chase situation in Chicago won’t be easy because it might require trading up to select Olave. With only five picks in the 2022 NFL Draft, that seems unlikely.\nPerhaps Olave falls to the Bears at No. 39, but that might be determined by how well he performs at this week’s NFL Combine. He said Wednesday he intends on doing all the drills and workouts in Indianapolis. Olave knows his 40-time and agility drills will be important, and he witnessed Fields go through it at Ohio State’s Pro Day last year after the 2021 NFL Combine was canceled.\n“I thought he was going to run a fast 4.3, but he ended up running 4.4,” Olave said. “He slipped at his start so I gotta put that in there.”\nOn draft night, Fields fell out of the top 10 and the Bears were able to trade up to select him at No. 11. They’ll probably need some similar fortune if they hope to land Olave too.\n\"Justin is a great player, great dude and I can't wait see his career take off,” Olave said.", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

In a continuing era of personnel shortages for the Catholic church, they seemed among an ever-decreasing number willing to take up a life of service as priests.\nMee, a native of the small Rhode Island city of Woonsocket on Massachusetts' southern and western borders, first heard of the Legion in August 1989.\nConcerned about a shortage of active priests, she asked a friend at her Narragansett parish: \"What are we going to do when we have no more?\"\nThe friend mentioned the order, saying they had a \"lot of vocations.\"\n\"Frankly, I caught fire,\" Mee said of that interaction. \"I thought there must be some priests. So I got home and I called up my banker. I said, 'Find out everything you can about the Legionaries of Christ.' \"\nVisiting the Legion's formation center in Cheshire, Conn., sometime after talking with her friend, Mee liked what she saw.\n\"What impressed me so much was to see a chapel filled with all these young men in their cassocks,\" she said.\nMee's first meeting with Fr. Marcial Maciel Degollado, the Legion's founder and duplicitous con-man who secretly fathered children and sexually abused young boys, would foreshadow a burgeoning financial and personal relationship with the order.\nMeeting Maciel at the Legion's Connecticut facility sometime after first hearing of the order, the priest told Mee that while the Legion was \"in a crunch\" financially, it would \"only ask God for what we need.\"\n\"And the angel Gabriel came down from heaven,\" Mee replied, referencing her first name, Gabrielle.\nThe reference to providence would be just the beginning of blessings the order would receive from the widow.\nAn Aug. 20, 1989, letter from Maciel to Mee thanks her for a $1 million donation for construction of a Legion seminary in Rome.\n\"I am deeply moved and very grateful for this extraordinary gift,\" Maciel wrote. \"You have no idea how much good this act of generosity will produce for the church.\"\nPerhaps sensing Mee's desire for an increase in the number of Catholic priests, Maciel also invited her to come to Rome on Jan. 3, 1991, for the seminary's inauguration, which was to include the ordination of 55 Legion priests.\n\"That the founder of The Legion of Christ has written to me is just overwhelming!\" Mee replied in a September 1989 handwritten letter of response to Maciel, whom she addressed as \"beloved Father.\"\n\"How profoundly soul satisfying are God's blessings!\" she wrote, saying she would accept the invitation.\nThe $1 million gift would be the first of many. By July 25, 1990, a memo from Mee's bank recorded another gift to the Legion of about $3 million in cash and securities.\nAs the head of a charitable foundation and later trust in honor of her late husband, Timothy, a prominent Rhode Island banker who died in 1985, Mee would provide many more such gifts, eventually directing that 90 percent of her and the trust's holdings, totaling about $30 million, be given to the order at the time of her death.\nFor Mee, the focus on Catholic giving arose out of a life shaped by devotional practices common to devout U.S. Catholic families in the 1940s and '50s.\nShe and her husband would say the rosary together \"every night.\" And Timothy, she said, \"never missed a Mass. Never.\"\nIn the Legion, she said she found a group in which she could be \"sure of what they were doing.\"\n\"I had extreme faith in what they were doing and they're proving today what they are doing,\" she said. \"They're re-Christianizing the entire world.\"\nWhile Mee may have had that dedication to the order in 2001, she raised questions about how her money was being used several times earlier.\nFollowing a 1997 Hartford Courant news report by Gerald Renner and Jason Berry outlining accusations by nine men that Maciel had abused them as boys, Mee handwrote a letter to her banker in March 1998.\nMee's donations to the order came first from a foundation and then a trust named after her husband, which was managed by Fleet Investment Management. Fleet merged with Bank of America in 2004.\nHer husband, Mee told the banker in 1998, \"always took great care to ensure that the companies he invested in were not marking out cross-purpose with his moral and charitable goals.\" Mee asked for \"written assurance\" that the money given from his trust never be invested in such a way as to \"contradict the moral principles or values taught by the Catholic Church.\"\nResponding to her March 1998 letter, Dorothy Derick, one of Fleet's vice presidents, wrote to Maciel directly in September 1998 asking for the Legion's \"concurrence\" with Mee's request, for copies of the Legion's investment portfolio, and periodic review of its continuing holdings.\nSuch inquiries would continue for years, even after Mee's death.\nIn August 2010, after the Legion had acknowledged for the first time in a March press release that Maciel had taken \"reprehensible actions,\" the vice president of Bank of America's philanthropic department, Vautina Franklin, emailed Fr. Jose Felix Ortega, a Legion priest who helped run the order's operations in Connecticut, asking if the order \"continues to be faithful to the Holy Father.\"\nWhile Ortega responded in December 2010 in another email referencing an attached letter from the Vatican on the matter, which he said would answer Franklin's inquiry, the Vatican letter has not surfaced in a review of the documents released Friday.\nBesides her donations to the order, Mee also joined its lay arm, Regnum Christi, as a consecrated woman in November 1991.\nComposed of separate groups for laywomen, laymen and diocesan priests, Regnum Christi is akin to a religious order and asks its members to profess vows of chastity, poverty and obedience.\nIts members can choose to become either first-, second- or third-degree members. Each layer of membership places additional responsibilities on members toward the order.\nA March 25, 1992, certificate indicating her induction into its third degree of membership shows Mee was told her motto while in the order was to be \"Whatever You say I will do. I will comply, through God's chosen instruments.\"\nAdditionally, she was to take a walk each day, have \"arm exercises daily\" and \"obey ... my directors and those Nuestro Padre has sent as my angels.\"\nNuestro Padre, Spanish for \"Our Father,\" was a title Legion members frequently used to refer to Maciel.\nAs a member of Regnum Christi, Mee was also expected to hand over her assets as part of her vow of poverty.\nAccording to a 2007 copy of its 28-page statutes, all Regnum Christi third-degree members are to \"renounce ... their licit right to use and exercise ownership over any material good without the permission of their legitimate directors.\"\nAdditionally, \"anything a consecrated member acquires through his work or as a donation, and everything he receives as a salary, pension, grant or insurance, regardless of how it is obtained, is to be sent to the general fund of the Congregation of the Legionaries of Christ.\"\nAnd: \"After fifteen years of consecrated life, a member is to donate half of his assets to the general fund, and after twenty-five years, all of his present and future assets.\"\nApproving a version of those statutes in November 2004, the Vatican's congregation for religious life said they were a vision of Christ's kingdom.\n\"The Apostolic See warmly prays that the members of the Regnum Christi Movement by faithfully following these Statutes will make them a further and effective means to extend Christ's Kingdom in the world,\" wrote Cardinal Franc Rode, then the head of the congregation, in an official letter.\nFor her part, Mee said she had been considering religious life since she was a child, when the order of the Religious of Jesus and Mary, which to this day maintains a mission center in Woonsocket, asked her to join.\nAfter her husband's death, she said, \"I knew that I had to do something.\"\nRegnum Christi, she said, \"were doing much of what I'd been doing. I was a daily person going to Mass and I got to know a lot about them and I decided, well, that was the way I was going to go.\"\nHer story, Mee said, ends: \"And she lived happily ever since. Continuation of the bliss and happiness I had with my marriage with Tim. Joyful life. Very nice. Totally fulfilled.\"\n[Joshua J. McElwee is an NCR staff writer.

They came after several years in which China had surged in the annual Doing Business rankings as a result of reforms pushed by Beijing.\nThe bank suspended publication of the often-controversial report in August 2020, citing “data irregularities” that had been found in previous years’ editions. That move also came after Malpass and other senior officials had been briefed on the rankings for that edition, known as Doing Business 2021, according to people familiar with the events.\nThe unreleased Doing Business 2021 report, which people familiar with it said was ready for publication and was seen by Bloomberg News, showed China rising to 25th in the world, from 31st in the previous year’s report. The report showed the U.S. holding at sixth. It was originally slated for release in October 2020 before being delayed and last week shelved for good.\nThis story is based on internal World Bank documents and interviews with more than a dozen people involved in the project over the last four years. They spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive matters, and some cited fear of retaliation from bank management.\nIn a response to questions from Bloomberg News, the World Bank said the 2021 edition had been paused due to data irregularities first raised by staff members in June 2020. It declined to confirm the rankings in the unreleased report and denied that China’s standing or other rankings had played any role in the decision.\nIn addition, any proposed changes to methodology were part of an institution-wide review, and Malpass didn’t pressure staff to consider any actions that would have affected the rankings of China or the U.S., the World Bank said.\n“Any changes that were considered in Doing Business methodology were developed by technical Doing Business staff, consulted upon widely within the bank and reviewed as part of a standing bank-wide process informed by years of previous work,” World Bank spokesman David Theis said. Any suggestion otherwise owes to “unnamed sources with axes to grind.”\nMalpass declined a request for an interview or comment.\nThe audit released last week, conducted by law firm WilmerHale, concluded that Malpass’s predecessor Jim Yong Kim and his top lieutenant Georgieva pressured staff to change the data to benefit China in the 2018 edition of the report. Georgieva has said she “fundamentally” disagrees with the audit’s conclusions; Kim didn’t respond to requests for comment.\nThe World Bank decided to discontinue Doing Business because “trust in it as a brand and as an index was too severely damaged to repair,” Malpass said in an internal note to staff Sept. 17.\nIn its response to Bloomberg News, the World Bank said the WilmerHale report spoke for itself. The law firm’s probe, which remains ongoing, focused on the 2018 and 2020 editions of the report. The audit said it didn’t identify any involvement in data changes by Malpass’s office related to the 2020 report, which was released in October 2019.\nHowever, documents seen by Bloomberg News indicate Malpass was engaged in discussions about altering methodology in a way that would potentially have hurt China’s ranking in Doing Business 2021, an edition not addressed in the WilmerHale review.\nAround June 2019, more than a year before the August 2020 decision to withhold publication, Malpass discussed a proposal to double the number of representative cities in the report to four for the three countries with the largest population: China, India and the U.S., according to internal documents.\nHe also discussed restoring an ease of employment metric that had been dropped amid opposition from Democrats in Congress. Including that metric would have caused China’s ranking to fall four places and the U.S.’s to rise by three, the documents show.\n“Just wanted to let you know informally that DM [Malpass] recently agreed with the Doing Business team to increase the number of cities from 2 to 4 covered by the index for countries with population over 300 million,” one of Malpass’s assistants wrote in a June 2019 email, seen by Bloomberg News, to other senior World Bank staff. “This impact [sic] China, India and United States. In China, the sample will include the third and fourth largest business cities: Chongqing and Guangzhou.”\nIn the email Malpass’s assistant said the president would be discussing it with senior Chinese officials. She also pointed to restoring the “Employing Workers” indicator, which if included “may impact China negatively.”\nIn December 2019, Malpass wrote then-Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin that while the bank had been considering restoring the indicator, it decided to leave it out of the rankings after “input from you and other stakeholders,” according to a letter released by the House Financial Services Committee.\nThe change in the number of cities was rejected for Doing Business 2021 after staff looked at the work involved, according to a February 2020 internal World Bank memo.\nThe data for the Doing Business 2021 covered the period through May 1, 2020, with staff preparing their initial analyses and circulating them internally for discussion over the summer.\nThe bank announced on Aug. 27, 2020, that it was suspending publication of the Doing Business report, citing “data irregularities,” and ordering reviews of the matter. This came more than two years after former chief economist Paul Romer raised questions about changes to the report’s methodology that made rankings volatile.\nWhat the World Bank didn’t say, however, was that days before the August 2020 announcement, Malpass and other top bank officials were presented with rankings for the 2021 edition of the report showing China advancing, people familiar with the matter said.\nIn its response to Bloomberg News, the World Bank said the Doing Business 2021 report’s release had been paused since August 2020 because concerns were raised by staff in June 2020 about data integrity.\nThe unreleased Doing Business 2021 report seen by Bloomberg News, however, shows that its authors wrote they had addressed the data irregularities raised and that they had found no other issues amid more rigorous scrutiny than before. “All data in Doing Business 2021 received three levels of formal review and approval in the data management system, implementing checks and balances,” the authors wrote.\nThe World Bank said in its response to Bloomberg News that the series was ultimately discontinued because the recent reviews and audits identified additional concerns.\nThe episode has illustrated how the World Bank and IMF’s top officials are increasingly squeezed between the geopolitical ambitions of the world’s two largest economies. The U.S. has been the biggest shareholder at both institutions since their advent in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire, at the close of World War II. China has been advocating for a larger role in the past decade. The two countries are locked in a trade war and are also jockeying for strategic position in the Indo-Pacific region.\nMalpass, 65, became World Bank president in April 2019 after being nominated by Trump for the job traditionally occupied by a U.S. pick. In his previous post as the U.S. Treasury’s undersecretary for international affairs he was a regular critic of China and its growing role in the global economy. He was also a skeptic of the country’s reform credentials.\nBefore joining the Trump administration, Malpass spent more than a decade as an economist at Bear Stearns Cos. He had served prior Republican presidents, worked as an aide on Capitol Hill and run unsuccessfully for the party’s nomination for U.S. Senate in New York in 2010.\nIn November 2018 testimony to a Senate subcommittee while he was at Treasury, Malpass bemoaned the “substantial inroads” China had made into multilateral development banks like the World Bank.\n“We are working with allies and like-minded countries to guide the MDBs away from what could be viewed as endorsement of China’s geopolitical ambitions,” Malpass said.\nAs well as giving validation to its policies, a further gain for China in the rankings could have been an embarrassment for Trump as he campaigned for re-election on both what he hailed as a pro-business record and his economic war against the Asian power. It also would have likely complicated Malpass’s relationship with Trump’s White House and Treasury Department.\nThe Doing Business series has long been both controversial and influential, with nations often lobbying for changes in their rankings. The bank has also for years conducted a parallel business selling consulting services to countries on how to improve their rankings -- a practice that reviews have flagged as a conflict of interest.\nIn a report not released publicly but seen by Bloomberg News, the bank’s internal watchdog questioned just how much impact the Doing Business reports really had on member economies. But it also detailed the broad scope of that work.\n“Doing Business also informs a substantial share of the World Bank Group’s projects providing financing, advice, and/or technical assistance to client countries on the business environment,” according to the report, dated Sept. 8. That “DB-informed portfolio” consisted of 676 projects worth $15.5 billion in World Bank loans from fiscal 2010 to 2020.\nEven with the issues swirling around the report, the decision to cancel it surprised many board members and employees just weeks before the World Bank and IMF are scheduled to hold their annual meetings, the year’s biggest event for the lenders. Dozens of staff worked on the high-profile project and now need to be reassigned; almost 15,000 “local partners” in 191 economies around the world helped collect data.\nIn addition, work on the 2022 edition of the report was largely complete but without rankings, people familiar with the matter said. They said a recent plan was to release both the delayed 2021 and new 2022 reports together in December of this year.\nIn its response, the World Bank said it had never had a firm timeline for the release of any further Doing Business reports, as they were dependent on the outcome of various investigations.\nMauricio Cardenas, a former Colombian finance minister who led an independent experts’ review of the report’s methodology released this week, said all of the discussions that panel had with bank officials in recent months were focused on how to reform the report rather than whether to discontinue it.\n“We had many meetings with many different groups within the bank. There were many criticisms, but it was always focused on reforms, changes,” he said in a phone interview. “If there’s no Doing Business, something needs to fill that space.”\n©2021 Bloomberg L.P.", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}
{"id": "658", "text": "Democrat Patrick Leahy’s announcement that he will retire after eight terms in the Senate has set off a scramble in Vermont over the rare opening in the state’s tiny congressional delegation.\nWhile political observers expect Democratic Rep. Peter Welch to be a leading candidate if he decides to run for the seat in 2022, there is also pressure for Vermont to elect a woman. It’s the only state in the nation to never send a woman to Congress.\nThe opening provides an opportunity for Vermont to rid itself of that distinction, said Debbie Walsh, director of the Center for American Women and Politics, on Tuesday.\n“It would be a good thing for Vermont to have some diversity in its representation in Washington to represent some of the diversity in the state,” she said. “The fact that Vermont has never had a woman’s voice representing it in Washington, D.C., with that set of life experience, with that sort of understanding of another dimension to policy questions, it’s a loss for the state of Vermont.”\nGet New England news, weather forecasts and entertainment stories to your inbox. Sign up for NECN newsletters.\nThe last time Vermont had an open seat was in 2006, when Bernie Sanders, then a congressman, succeeded Jim Jeffords as a U.S. senator and Welch, then president of the state Senate, took Sanders’ spot in the state’s only U.S. House seat.\nAmong the possible candidates for Leahy’s Senate seat is Democratic Lt. Gov. Molly Gray, said Garrison Nelson, a retired University of Vermont political science professor and a congressional scholar. But Nelson noted that Gray, a former Burlington attorney who has served as lieutenant governor since January, doesn’t have much political experience.\nOther names being floated include Vermont Senate President Pro Tempore Becca Balint and state Sen. Kesha Ram Hinsdale, both Democrats. Ram Hinsdale said Tuesday that she is considering running for the House if Welch runs for the Senate.\n“It would be a shock to Vermonters if he decided not to run,” she said of Welch.\nWelch, who praised Leahy after his retirement announcement, said Tuesday that he will make a decision about his political future “in the coming days.” If he does run for Leahy’s Senate seat, Nelson noted that Welch is 74, not much younger than Sanders, now 80, and Leahy, 81.\nWelch has developed a spot for himself in the House and is well-liked there, so “this is an intensely personal choice for someone like him,” said Linda Fowler, professor emerita of government at Dartmouth College.\nRepublicans are likely to struggle fielding a competitive candidate in the liberal state, Nelson said, especially since GOP Gov. Phil Scott has said he’s not interested in running.\nThe state Republican Party chair sent out a statement after Leahy’s announcement saying they have “an incredible opportunity to recruit the kind of high caliber candidate to win this seat and make Vermont more competitive than ever before.”\nRepublican Scott Milne, a travel industry executive who unsuccessfully challenged Leahy in 2016, would not say Tuesday whether he is considering running again. He did say, however, that he was unsure whether Welch would be the right person to bring needed change in a “dysfunctional” Washington.\nFowler noted that it might take a while for prospective candidates to decide whether to mount a campaign, so any speculation right now is premature.\n“In my experience with potential candidates, they have to look at their finances, where their kids are in school and what their spouse thinks,” she said.\nBut Fowler noted that Leahy has given potential candidates ample time to figure out what they want to do, given that his announcement came a year before the 2022 election.\n“It’s just one more mark of the fact that he’s a very classy guy,” she said.", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}
{"id": "659", "text": "As the page turns and we put 2021 in the rear-view, a lot of people are asking what 2022 may hold for the occupational medicine (OccMed) industry. In this article, we’re going to look at three expected trends for OccMed that we plan to see in 2022. Additionally, we’ll share some actionable steps that organizations can take to get ahead of the curve and position themselves for success in the new year.\n1. A Shift from Reactivity to Proactivity\nIn the last two years, the industry has been plagued with unexpected twists and turns as a result of the COVID-19 public health emergency (PHE). And while every year in healthcare brings some sort of new and unique changes, this is the understatement of the century when applied to the past two years. Unfortunately, as we move into 2022, COVID-19 and its variants show no signs of going anywhere.\nWhile the presence of COVID-19 looks to remain a constant trend, the way in which OccMed teams react will (and should) be changing in 2022. Instead of being as reactionary as we’ve been forced to be over the past two years, we can now shift our approach to a proactive response. Yes, there are still unknowns, but we have so much more information now that we didn’t have years ago. The availability of these resources should empower teams and organizations to approach PHE planning proactively.\nActionable Step: Put in processes to stay on top of any changes to vaccine mandates and utilize technology to better track compliance. For OccMed providers, this is a unique way to build competitive advantages.\n2. A New Host of Injuries and Conditions\nFor OccMed providers, keeping the workforce happy, healthy, and productive is a key component of success. Often, this requires OccMed to analyze the working conditions of their clients and offer proactive solutions to identify and mitigate potential health risks. For many workers, though, those work conditions have changed dramatically over the past two years. As a result of the PHE, many workers now work from home or are required to alter the way in which they work to meet new health-related rules and regulations.\nAnytime we drastically change working conditions, we also alter risk factors. For example, working from home can mean uncomfortable workspaces that cause injury, changes in stress levels and emotional health, and even increases in unhealthy eating.\nActionable Step: Make sure you’re planning to prevent as many of these new risk factors as possible to save money on future injuries. Additionally, ensure you’re not still allocating resources to risk factors that are no longer an issue due to changes in work habits or environment.\n3. The Normalcy of New Technology\nThroughout the PHE, we saw a big rise in the use of telehealth. As of mid-2021, over 76% of U.S. hospitals were connecting with patients and consulting practitioners at a distance through the use of mobile apps, video, and other technology.1 Prior to the PHE, there was a major barrier to acceptance between patients and providers who struggled to see the efficacy of this treatment method. As COVID-19 made telehealth necessary, many patients (and providers) quickly saw how effective and convenient leveraging this technology really was, regardless of the pandemic.\nWhat this means for OccMed and healthcare as a whole is that we shouldn’t expect patients to want to abandon this convenience even if and when COVID-19 makes its way to the rear-view.\nActionable Step: If you haven’t already, start making plans to explore implementing some form of telehealth into your offerings to employers. Additionally, start exploring other potential new technologies like predictive analytics or tech-forward EHR solutions that can help you separate yourself from the pack in what will certainly be a more competitive industry.\nThe Final Word and a Bonus 2022 OccMed Trend\nWhat we just alluded to is something that all OccMed practices need to be aware of — the industry will continue to become more and more competitive in 2022. What this means is that it’s critical OccMed providers that want to survive and thrive need to be on the cutting edge of the industry as much as possible.\nIf you’d like to learn more about how you and your team can do just that, we’d invite you to read our free e-book titled—6 Tactics to Grow and Expand Your OccMed Business. Including insights from Gene Howell, CEO of Reliant Urgent Care, which serves hundreds of patients a day at Los Angeles International Airport, the ebook provides real-world actionable steps you can take today to best position your organization for 2022 in response to these trends.\n6 Tactics to Grow and Expand Your OccMed Business\nScale up quickly to guide employers in improving worker health\n1.

{"id": "670", "text": "More power, faster rollouts, lower costs\nWind remains one of the most popular and stable sources of renewable energy. In fact, wind is among the world’s fastest growing renewable energy sources, expected to provide 12% of global electricity demand by 2020. Compared to other technologies, from nuclear power to coal, onshore wind can offer energy at the lowest Total Cost of Ownership, taking into account everything from development to maintenance costs.\nToday, global installed wind energy capacity is almost 487 GW. The European Wind Energy Association expects 320 GW of wind energy capacity will be installed in the EU by 2030, of which 254 GW will be onshore.\nThe falling cost of wind power, efficiency increases, and attractive policies are expected to boost growth even further. What’s more, the 2015 Paris Climate Summit (COP 21) saw a broad coalition agree to halt global warming at 2°C, or even 1.5° - an important driver for renewables. In addition, wind energy continues to show solid global growth. In many regions around the world, onshore wind is seen as an essential component to the energy transformation, often together with solar energy.\nCompared to alternatives (nuclear, coal), the CAPEX and OPEX are very attractive. Of course, the faster an installation is completed, the faster it can start producing energy – and generating Return on Investment.\nWhy wind ?\n- Wind offers the lowest Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) available. The Annual Levelized Cost of Energy Analysis from leading financial advisory and asset management firm Lazard (November 2017) indicates that wind offers the lowest energy cost of all current technologies – and that’s without factoring in subsidies.\n- Onshore wind can compete with fossil fuels and other renewables on price – and it is becoming even more so as fossil fuel power costs increase.\n- Increasing yields thanks to longer blades, taller towers and more powerful generators.\n- Once wind turbines are up and running, their carbon footprint remains extremely low.\n- Impact on the environment is limited. It’s possible to farm around onshore wind turbines, which emit no toxins or waste.\n- Onshore turbines typically have an uptime around 98% and require limited maintenance downtime.\n- Current turbines already extract almost 50% of energy conveyed in wind.\n- Technological advances include the ability to harvest energy at low wind speeds.\nLevelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) makes it possible to compare the cost of energy from different sources. LCOE is calculated by adding up all costs incurred throughout the generating technology’s lifetime divided by the units of energy produced during the lifetime of the project. The result is expressed as units of currency per kilowatt hour.\nToday, the main challenge is to optimize the layout of a wind farm in order to minimize CAPEX and OPEX while simultaneously maximizing the power output. To do this, we need to examine four questions:\n- How to build and arrange the Medium Voltage Alternating Current Collector network that connects turbine substations in a way that minimizes CAPEX?\n- How to decrease OPEX by minimizing the number of joints?\n- How to maximize output power in a given investment?\n- How to optimize the cable supply together with the laying process?\nNexans offers an integrated approach to ‘Balance of Plant’, combining engineering, installation, cables and interconnect product supply. We participate from the earliest stage of your project, offering engineering support to optimize network engineering, based on our expertise in cables and cable laying. From the outset, Nexans Engineering Service Department works with Project Developers and Engineering Procurement and Construction (EPC) stakeholders to find optimization possibilities.\nUsing GPS position data, site surveys, soil examinations and data on power generation from each turbines, ampacity of cables and trenches cross-section design, network layout and configuration are optimized. The main outcome is, in most of our projects, a reduction of trenches and cable lengths. The ideal connection and branching points are precisely determined, based on fixed turbine positions. Precisely determining the optimized cable mix, cross-section balance, joint locations, optimized trenches sizes and filling rate make it possible to reduce CAPEX and OPEX whilst maximizing output power generation. Today’s high loads can be transported over greater distances to substations without difficulty.\nTotal solutions provider utilizing group and partner resources\n- Engineering competences to support your own engineering team\n- CAPEX savings based on optimized trenching & cables lengths\n- OPEX savings based on optimized number of joints\n- Cable and interconnection solutions compliant with relevant International and Local Standards\n- Reduction of overall number of joints\n- Point-to-point circuits for the most effective solutions\n- Longer cable length per drum\n- Long length single core cables trefoil on site\n- Many years of experience in laying very long cables to substations\n- Single system warranty\n- Single point of responsibility and liability combines product supply and laying: peace of mind for installers, owners, operators and other stakeholders.\nInnovative installation methods, combining fully-integrated drum carrier, cable binding and laying solution allows single core cables, trefoiled into three-core cable on site, to be continuously laid together with fiber optic and earthing cables. This unique one-step cable installation solution reduces the number of drums, jointing sections and joints and on-site installation days. It also generates tangible installation cost savings while reducing the number of potential service interruption during plant operation.\nOur fully integrated solution comes with a single warranty and liability document. It doesn’t only optimize costs and maximize efficiency right away, but also makes sure you’re ready to accommodate ever-increasing turbine output levels.\nSelect your country to find our products and solutions", "scores": {"score": 3, "score_transform_1": 5, "score_transform_2": 5, "score_transform_3": 0}}

{"id": "674", "text": "While turboprop manufacturers are reporting positive growth in sales and turboprops have remained a major component of regional air carriers flying in the world, the United States has not followed world trends. Turboprop fleets and sales are down significantly since the mid-1990s. As of mid-2017, there are no signs indicating that trend is reversing. U.S. air carriers do not have any turboprop airplanes on order; to date, only 300 are currently flying in the country, with an average age of 21 years. Meanwhile, in 2013, total orders for turboprop aircraft only reached 164 aircraft between ATR and Bombardier (a number consistent with industry forecasts for 2014-2033), causing Brazilian manufacturer Embraer to forego re-entry into the turboprop market. However, reports at the 2017 Paris Air Show suggest that the company’s stance might change, with a 90-seat turboprop potentially in the works.\nRecently, European airframer ATR tried to pitch its turboprop fleets to North America as a low-cost option for shorter routes, potentially replacing regional jets as well as existing turboprops. Currently, their only U.S. customer is FedEx; the last major order by a U.S. firm was placed Mesaba Aviation, a Minneapolis company, in 1996. However, lowered costs of fuel could lead to an eventual resurgence of turboprop craft. Average variable costs per hour, including fuel, tend to run slightly lower for turboprops compared to jets, although so do their carrying capacities and ranges.\nExisting turboprop fleets worldwide have seen a growing number of safety concerns. In China, the Modern Ark 60 (MA60) has had a poor safety record, with frequent brake, steering, and landing gear failures. Over 11% of such vehicles have been damaged beyond repair since their inception, clouding China’s aviation future. Furthermore, the production company allegedly failed to disclose certain safety information to buyers, despite legal obligations. Meanwhile, in Australia, an incident in 2014 involving a pitch disconnect in an ATR72 has led to greater scrutiny of turboprop manufacturers Virgin and Toll, including monthly reports to the Civil Aviation Safety Agency (CASA).

Regular consumption can lead to a variety of health benefits, so incorporating green drinks into your regular diet is highly recommended.\nPotential RisksWhen it comes to green drinks, it is important to consider the potential risks associated with them.\nOver-consumption of green drinks can lead to an imbalance in the body's natural electrolyte levels, which can cause dehydration, fatigue, and muscle cramps. Additionally, some people may be allergic to certain ingredients in green drinks, such as wheatgrass or barley grass. If you experience any adverse reactions after consuming a green drink, it is important to stop using it and seek medical advice. It is also important to be mindful of the sugar content in green drinks.\nMany commercial varieties contain added sugar, which can increase your risk of developing cavities or other dental health issues. If you are looking for a healthier option, look for a variety of green drink that is made with natural sweeteners, such as honey or maple syrup.\nBenefits of Green DrinksGreen drinks are a great way to improve your digestion, as they contain a number of beneficial ingredients. Many of these ingredients are rich in dietary fiber, which helps to promote digestive regularity and reduce the risk of constipation. These drinks also contain antioxidants and vitamins that can help to protect the digestive system from damage and reduce inflammation. Certain green drinks can also provide probiotics, which are beneficial bacteria that can help to balance your gut microflora.\nThis can lead to improved digestion and a stronger immune system. Additionally, some green drinks contain prebiotics, which are food sources for the probiotics. This helps to further promote the growth of beneficial bacteria. Examples of ingredients in green drinks that are beneficial to digestive health include alfalfa, wheatgrass, spirulina, chlorella, and barley grass. These superfoods are packed with minerals, vitamins, and antioxidants that can help to improve your digestive health.\nAdditionally, many green drinks contain ginger and turmeric which have anti-inflammatory properties and can help to improve digestion.\nGetting the Most Out of Green DrinksGetting the most out of your green drinks is all about understanding the potential health benefits they can offer. To maximize the digestive benefits of green drinks, it is important to know what type of green drink is right for you, as well as how much and how often to consume them. When selecting a green drink, it is important to consider the ingredients and the nutrients they contain. Look for drinks that contain a variety of leafy greens, like kale, spinach, collard greens, and Swiss chard.\nThese greens are packed with fiber, vitamins, and minerals that can help improve digestion. Additionally, look for drinks that contain probiotics to aid in digestion. The amount and frequency of consuming green drinks also plays an important role in getting the most out of them. Drinking green drinks throughout the day can be beneficial for digestion, but it’s important to not overdo it.\nStart by drinking one cup a day and work up to two or three cups a day if desired. Be sure to drink plenty of water throughout the day as well. Finally, it’s important to note that there may be potential risks associated with drinking green drinks, particularly when they are loaded with sugar or artificial sweeteners. It is important to read labels and choose green drinks that are low in added sugar.\nPreparing Green Drinks SafelyWhen preparing green drinks, it’s important to make sure they are safe for consumption. To do this, start by washing your hands thoroughly with soap and water before preparing any green drinks. Additionally, it’s important to make sure all fruits and vegetables used are fresh and properly washed before being blended or juiced. Any food that appears to be spoiled or contaminated should be discarded immediately. When blending or juicing your green drinks, it’s important to follow the manufacturer’s instructions carefully.\nIf you are using a high-speed blender, be sure to blend your ingredients on a low setting for a few seconds at a time. This will ensure that the ingredients are evenly blended without creating too much heat, which could potentially reduce the nutritional value of your green drink. When juicing, it’s important to use the correct type of juicer and fresh produce. Be sure to follow the instructions for your particular juicer to ensure that you get the most out of your ingredients and avoid over-juicing or damaging the machine.\nAdditionally, it’s important to avoid adding any artificial sweeteners or other additives to your green drink, as these can potentially reduce its nutritional value. Finally, it’s important to store any leftover green drinks in an airtight container in the refrigerator. This will help ensure that they stay fresh and retain their nutritional value. Additionally, if you make large batches of green drinks at one time, it is best to store them in small portions and consume them within a few days.\nTypes of Green DrinksGreen drinks come in a variety of forms, including juices, smoothies, and powders. Green juices are typically made by pressing fruits and vegetables together to extract their liquid, while green smoothies are created by blending the same ingredients together until they reach a smooth consistency.\nGreen powders are made from dehydrated fruits and vegetables that have been ground into a powder form. Green juices are a great way to get an abundance of vitamins and minerals quickly. They are typically low in calories and easy to digest. Juices also contain all the fiber from the fruits and vegetables, which can help promote digestive health.\nHowever, they lack the protein and fat found in whole fruits and vegetables, so it’s important to combine juice with other foods for a balanced meal. Green smoothies are a great source of vitamins, minerals, and protein. The blending process breaks down the cell walls of the fruits and vegetables, making them easier to digest. They are also packed with fiber, which can help you feel fuller longer.\nSmoothies are also a great way to add healthy fats such as nuts or nut butter to your diet. Green powders are an easy way to get your daily dose of vitamins and minerals on the go. They can be added to shakes or smoothies or sprinkled over food. They are usually made from a blend of different fruits and vegetables, providing an array of nutrients in one convenient package.\nHowever, it’s important to check the label to make sure you’re getting a quality product that is free from added sugars or preservatives. In conclusion, green drinks offer a variety of digestive benefits and can be a great addition to a balanced diet. However, it is important to be aware of the potential risks associated with them, such as added sugar or preservatives, as well as to make sure that they are prepared in a safe and healthy way. By researching the different types of green drinks available, understanding the benefits they offer, and preparing them safely, you can ensure you are getting the most out of green drinks for your digestive health.", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}
{"id": "678", "text": "Due to Andy preparing the review that accompanied today’s album premiere, I found myself with some spare time that I don’t usually have. What to do with that? I thought about continuing to play catch-up on my Most Infectious Song list by putting together a second installment for the day, but decided instead to listen to some new songs for the purpose of compiling a round-up. It didn’t take me long to find some that hooked me, in part because my comrade DGR pointed me to two of them.\nSHARED TRAUMA (U.S.)\nI’m beginning with the first of DGR’s suggestions. It’s the debut single from a new band named Shared Trauma, which was formed by former members of The Black Dahlia Murder (Ryan “Bart” Williams) and The Faceless (Derek Rydquist, Michael Sherer, Brandon Griffin), along with drummer John Thomas.

{"id": "679", "text": "It amazes me how many people think that since I've made YouTube videos about the religion I was brought up in, which is dominant in my culture going back millenia, and which I threw myself into whole-heartedly as a teenager, and struggled with, and eventually came to face as having been a lie that I'd lived like a fucking dupe, that that means that I am OBLIGED now, given the size of my subscriber base, to make videos about a religion about which I know absolutely fuck all and have never ever had any experience of whatsoever. Islam.\nPeople seem to fail to realise that the strength of my videos about Christianity comes from the fact that I know things about Christianity. A lot. I know a LOT about Christianity. I can pull bible quotes and references out of what would appear to some to be thin air, but which is actually decades of exposure to the religion and its text and theology and apologetics. Perhaps the tiny references and citation gags that I insert into my scripts have gone over the head of many of the people who have enjoyed my videos. Trust me, they're in there. It isn't only my brilliant MS-Paint artwork that has made them so discomfiting for many Christians.\nMore and more, over the last few years, as Islam has become prominent in the western mind, I've been getting comment after comment from people who think that I ought to just flick that switch that I apparently have in my mind, download a lifetime's intimate experience of the religion of Islam, and make NonStampCollector videos about that religion, instead; complete, presumably, with the same sort of awareness and familiarity that has given my videos about Christianity their strength.\nSeriously, in many people's minds, I have a moral obligation to make videos about Islam, and they think that if I have any gaps in my knowledge of Islam, then I have a moral obligation to fill those gaps with research, in my own abundant spare time; the kind of spare time that has allowed me to make, on average, one video per year for the last 4 years, on a topic with which I am already abundantly familiar.\nSome commenters can get pretty indignant in their demands that I devote the time between work and my family responsibilities to becoming as familiar with Islam as I am with Christianity (which would likely only take several decades, after all), so as to be able to make the videos that I am apparently obliged to make. They DEMAND that I receive the same kind of inspiration, regarding Islam, that have always been the spark of new NSC script ideas. They seem to be demanding that I be walking down the street, pondering some interesting little chestnut of Islamic scripture or lore (as though I'm as likely to be doing that as they themselves are), and come up with an analogous satirical parallel involving various characters from the Qaran which will draw on an enormous number of references to all corners of the faith, allow for all sorts of finicky language jokes, and put the Islamic faithful in a self-reflective corner that might disturb their mental status-quo and commence some sort of re-evaluation of the sorts of apologetics that they've always clung to in mental defense of their faith.\nTo such commenters, the absence of Islam-related videos on my channel is deemed to be absolute proof that I am indeed an APOLOGIST for Islam. \"You've made videos about Christianity, but not about Islam? Ah ha! Undeniable proof that you secretly support Islam!\" I have been told on numerous occasions by numerous people that I am not entitled to use the term \"antitheist\" to describe my views on religion, because of this glaring lack of Youtube material. I'll often be called a coward, or more recently, a \"regressive\", for not having developed the means by which I might be able to make my style of videos about a religion about which I know zero details. (That, after all, shows such a fantastic and thorough understanding of what Harris and Nawaz mean by the term \"regressive left\". not.)\nClose to two years ago, such a comment came in, and I'd like to post a version of my response to it, as it has not received an adequate response from the OP, and sums up my usual response. In fact, I may have given you the link to this blog post because I want you to read this as my response to a comment of your own. (Having said that, though, my response is pretty abrasive, and if you haven't been rude to me then please don't take the rudeness of my response hereunder to apply to you. I mean - look at how the guy opened.)\nMy response went thus:\nYou said: \"Do something similar about muslims instead you fucking coward.\"\nIt was a compelling argument that you made, eloquently stated, and I find myself convinced. I'm going to do it!\nHowever, I'm going to need a great deal of help, because I know next to nothing about the Islamic faith. I'm absolutely incapable of coming up with a snappy 12-minute script filled with references to all corners of their scriptures without your help - in fact beyond the Qaran and the Hadith (whatever that is), neither of which I've ever read, I really don't know enough to even have an idea for a basis of a well-researched script.\nSo, I suggest that we do a co-write. You're convinced that I need to MAKE these videos, and you also seem convinced that the necessary preparation will be a piece of cake that requires fuck all in terms of effort and time, so I'll assume you're happy to volunteer to be my research assistant. Working together should be a fun adventure! I'm glad to have you on board.\nPlease get the ball rolling by providing me with a detailed crash course in Islamic beliefs, customs, texts, history, politics, apologetics, and culture that's sufficient for me to be able to start finding little problems out of which to start making up jokes, but short and compelling enough for me to read between all of the other things that I have to do with my time- (keeping in mind that in recent years, between work and family responsibilities, I've only ever had time to make one or two videos per year. Your report had better be good and concise.)\nOnce you've done that, we can start choosing characters. I don't know any Qaranic characters beyond the prophet and his 9-year-old bride. Do you know any others? How many? Do you know anything about their characteristics and history? Family connections? Roles? Anecdotes that can be ridiculed? Again, since you think it will be so easy for ME to do the necessary research, you won't have any problem volunteering to do it your fucking self.\nAfter that we'll need a scenario into which to couch the action we depict in the script. Should we go contemporaneous, or humorously yank the scenario out of its history and into a completely different context? Give a reason for your decision on this.\nWe'll need some contradictions and mistakes from the text, in fact I'll need PLENTY to choose from just like I have when it comes to Christianity, so you'd better get to work on that, too. And given that a lot of the \"contradictions\" that people do see in the Bible simpy aren't contradictions at all, in my opinion, you'll need to give a for-and-against argument on each one that you include so I can be confident that it won't be swatted down by the first muslim listener who hears it.\nOh, and by the way. Think of the pains I've gone to in the past to to make sure there aren't any significant errors of theology or apologetics in my videos. If you go making any mistakes in the research you go doing for this, we're absolutely fucked; you realise that, right? If people who know the religion more than either of us start picking holes in our script or our understanding of the history and traditions we're dealing with, it will all have been for zip fucking squat. You get that, right? This video we're working on needs to be convincing and persuasive to people who have been in the religion for their whole life. An absolute precursor to even having them take any notice of our video is for them to be convinced that we know their religion as well as they do. Otherwise: it is for NOTHING. Your research needs to be 100 percent bullet-proof.\nBut again, that shouldn't be a problem, right?- you seem to think that I could handle it all on my own, in my spare time, so it ought to be a cinch for you.\nIf you agree to this, then email me your initial proposal, you fucking coward, and let's get to work.\nYou stupid, arrogant, ignorant fuck.", "scores": {"score": 0, "score_transform_1": 0, "score_transform_2": 0, "score_transform_3": 1}}

{"id": "684", "text": "CharmVerse's Xandra Dozet had the pleasure of chatting with Alejandro of Kokonut Network about bringing agriculture to web3 and using CharmVerse to empower and engage their community. Read on to learn some surprising facts about coconuts and maybe CharmVerse, too!\nOr you can listen to the entire Twitter Space here.\nChamVerse: So today I am talking with Alejandro (aka Wasabi), cofounder of Kokonut Network, and we'll be talking about the mission behind this DAO, his role there. And then we'll get into the meat of the discussion and dig into his opinions on CharmVerse.\nWasabi: Kokonut Network. We are trying to build a bridge between web3 and agriculture through a network of coconut farms. This is why we launched a DAO, so we can coordinate and we can use the DAO to fundraise and for rewards, distributions and governance. That's what we're doing.\nCharmVerse: And it's an agricultural DAO, correct?\nWasabi: Yeah, that's what we're working on, connecting the agriculture to web3 by creating a network of coconut farms. we have a first [farm] that is going to host 16,000 coconut trees.\nCharmVerse: Cool. And when I was digging into the website, I didn't realize how much that specific type of palm tree was used in so many products around the world.\nWasabi: Yes, it is a very versatile fruit. It is the most useful fruit out there because you can use coconut for pretty much everything. Like, you can use them for the health industry. You can use it for cosmetics, you can use it for food. For example, coconut sugar, coconut milk. You can use it even for cars. Automakers use coconut oil. It's like the coconut hair. They create something like fiber glass with these derivatives from the coconut. So it is very useful. [The coconut] is a circular fruit by default. Sometimes people want to build a circular economy, but a coconut is circular by default because nothing goes to waste. You can use even the shells. You can create plates and spoons and forks with the shells.\"\nCharmVerse: I love it. And not only that. But also these coconut farms are a refuge for animals, right?\nWasabi: Yeah. Basically we are preserving and creating new habitats by doing this Kokonut project. Because you can take land that is sitting there collecting dust, doing nothing and you can create these coconut farms. The first cycle of a coconut tree can last up to 20 years, before peak fruit bearing. That means that for up to 20 years at least, you cannot use this land for anything other than coconut farming. So you are creating a habitat for animals, a source of pollen for bees, you know how pollination works and how critical is for everyone to have a bunch of bees running around.\nCharmVerse: What's your role at Kokonut DAO? I know you said you're a cofounder but what's your day to day over there?\nWasabi: I handle everything from partnerships to this type of public event. I do pretty much a little bit of everything. That's why my title is Secretary of Kokonut Estate. I have to make sure that everything is going according to the plan....And I'm literally the bridge between the landowners, the Kokonut DAO members,... and I'm in the center of everything.\nCharmVerse: How large is the community of Kokonut Network?\nWasabi: So right now we have 43 DAO members. And the goal for this month is to partner with at least 50 projects from the last Gitcoin solution round. Because we created a lot of new friends and synergies with them, we plan to expand the community in that vertical. We've been working on a paper called \"How to Regenerate Diversity Using Coconuts.\" So in this case we are going to target organizations that are aligned with us with the same values that want to be basically the founding members of Kokonut DAO. Because right now. the members that are getting shares and the people that are joining the project are basically the founding members. Sometimes people ask about NFTs, blah blah blah, and I tell people all the time, it is up to you to make these types of decisions within Kokonut DAO. DAO members have 99% of voting power. We as core team, we don't even have 1% voting power. So it's like I always tell people, it is up to you to use this natural asset however the community sees fit. That's the point of the DAO, right? It's for the community to come together and take initiative and do what needs to be done.\nCharmVerse: So you are taking on new members? How would someone become a part of the community?\nWasabi: They just have to join in the discord. We have the DAO lounge and DAOhaus on the Gnosis Chain. So it is a pretty straightforward process. Like you just have to contribute $20 per share. Each share is going to be always backed by one plant, by one coconut tree forever. Like once this coconut tree stops bearing fruit, we're going to replant the tree. And the same share that you bought, let's say, 20 years ago, is going to be still backed by one coconut tree.\nCharmVerse: Now I want to get into the dirt and your experience and don't hold back. I want to hear what you have to say about CharmVerse. So how did you first discover CharmVerse?\nWasabi: I was doing research. I'm looking for DAO tooling. Because at first, since the beginning, we just wanted to create Kokonut and give complete power to the community. So we were looking for a tool that allows us to provide access and sort of privacy for the DAO members. So that's how I first found out about CharmVerse.\nCharmVerse: And why CharmVerse? What made you go that route?\nWasabi: The list of features. Every tool that I have stumbled upon, they were missing something. Like. Some have the docs, some have the tasks, some have the boards, but none of them have all of the things. Like docs, tasks, boards, bounties, proposals - none of them had them all. At first, I was just talking on the CharmVerse Discord, looking at okay, let's see what's up. Because I consider myself a power user for tools. I love to be trying tools, but I believe I have used every tool out there. Once I saw CharmVerse and the flexibility, I just was waiting on the product to become a little more mature. And that happened, like, one month ago. I saw all of the updates coming together and I was like, okay, I need to migrate and we need to change [now].\nCharmVerse: I love to hear that. Our team has been working nonstop to ship a lot of great features since the summer. So it's great to hear that. Did you use Notion or do you use Notion? Did you use Notion before?\nWasabi: Yeah, Literally. I'm done with Notion. I love it. But it is for very small teams. Once it got strong, let's say three plus members, you got a lot of headaches. With the permissions, with the monthly plans and everything. You start getting the growing pains once you reach three plus members.\nCharmVerse: That's good to hear. So how are you currently using the platform?\nWasabi: Right now I'm using the platform for information for the DAO members while we set up the Bounties section. Right now I'm updating all of the tasks with the proper properties and assigning tasks to people. Right now I use the platform as an information hub. I have a landing page that's going to be the first page a members see when they go inside and the rest of them is going to be gated to DAO members. And this information hub is going to be available for bounty hunters for and everyone within the community, pretty much, that is already what is listed with some type of role from Discord or using Google. This information page is going to be public, but the rest of the workspace is going to be view and comment only for DAO members and using an NFT batch to provide roles for the team. So we set up a token gate with an NFT. So automatically all of the Kokonut team members going to have a full access to the entire workspace. But for the DAO members, we just provide review and comment only access. They request something because they want to be part of some guild or any team or committee.\nCharmVerse: You're able to have your own landing page. So it looks like your own personal space, right?\nWasabi: Customized space, yeah. And the price chart for crypto is very useful for calculating bounties. Having these price charts inside the workspaces is something else.\nCharmVerse: So let's see. So for Bounties, how are you using this function? What are you paying out for currently?\nWasabi: We're just paying out the bounty hunters right now. We use the bounty function to pay for tasks that are out of the area of expertise of the core team. For example, we run a bounty for the treasury management research so we can create new vouchers, we can create stable coins based on cocnuts. And this was one of the first bounties that we ran on the platform. And I love the process within the Bounties. It is a bridge and very organized.\nCharmVerse: And you can do batch payments. Do you ever use that?\nWasabi: Yeah, No, we haven't because we have the DAOhaus, we don't have Gnosis Safe yet. We're going to be using this later on with custom tokens. We are planning to create a custom token that you can exchange after for shares or for stables. We are planning to play a bit with these bounties and custom tokens.\nCharmVerse: Fantastic. I look forward to seeing that and hearing more about it. So I think a lot of people, when we talk about DAOs, people get super curious about the governance within DAOs. So how do you create do you use CharmVerse to create proposals?\nWasabi: Not yet, because like I said, we are DAOhaus, so we can just submit a proposal on chain. But starting next week, we are going to start using the proposal builder that I love so much. The first proposal that we're going to use this for is for the Kokonut DAO constitution. I believe that it is a very important piece for the project and what a better tool to create this constitution than the proposal builder. We want to be able to do so much reviewing and drafting before going to vote. And it's crazy how much overhead we take off the plate.\nCharmVerse: So other than the proposal builder, what are the future plans and objectives relative to CharmVerse for Kokonut network?\nWasabi: CharmVerse is going to be like the key to unlock the Kokonut Network, and Kokonut DAO growth as a whole. When you have a web3 enabled workspace, the possibility just becomes limitless because you are basically automatically connected to everything. You can have an NFT launch and you can program this NFT to have access to certain pages within the workspace and you can run new programs and create new mechanics for community participation. So I believe that this migration to CharmVerse is going to be the key to really scale the whole Kokonut mission and the work we're doing because right now we're going to be able to have more contributors, more people helping and shaping the project. So we have big plans for CharmVerse as a hub of operations for our DAO.\nCharmVerse: Well, we are very happy to be able to facilitate that.", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}
{"id": "688", "text": "Factors Linked to Racial Disparities in Chronic Pain After Injury\nChronic pain is a top cause of disability in the United States, with the costs of medical care and lost productivity exceeding $500 billion, according to an Institute of Medicine report. Many people who suffer an acute traumatic injury—such as from a car crash or violence—continue to experience pain in the year after injury.October 06, 2023\nPast research has independently established the existence of racial disparities in injury outcomes and in the severity and treatment of chronic pain but not which factors impact chronic pain after an injury. But a collaborative new study led by Penn Nursing researchers and published in the journal Injury Prevention provides new insights into when and why an injury progresses to chronic pain.\nThe study enrolled a cohort of 650 adult participants—38% white, 33% Black, and 26% Hispanic—from two Level 1 trauma centers in Pennsylvania and Texas. Researchers collected data from medical records and patient interviews within days of injury, three months after injury, and 12 months postinjury. The researchers also assessed preinjury pain, perceived pain control, post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms, depression symptoms, discharge with an opioid prescription and follow-up provider visits.\nThe study found that among seriously injured adults, racial and ethnicity-based disparities in chronic pain may be most driven by differences in the nature of and health care response to acute injuries. Factors associated with disparities include mechanism of injury, severity of injury, pain in the hospital, and length of hospital stay. As an example of differences in mechanisms of injury, Black participants—who reported the highest chronic pain severity in the year after injury—were more likely to be injured by violence when compared to white and Hispanic participants.\n“I think that the takeaway, for me, was that you can’t take prevention out of the picture when thinking about intervening on racialized disparities in long-term recovery,” says Sara Jacoby, MPH, MSN, PhD, FAAN, associate professor of nursing and the first author on the study.\n“The absolute best targeted response is to prevent the injury from happening, and that is our responsibility. Just like we want to do preventative care to prevent a heart attack or stroke, we want to prevent injury from happening,” says senior author Therese Richmond, PhD, RN FAAN, the Andrea B. Laporte Professor of Nursing. She says the second-best targeted response is optimally and equitably treating acute pain during hospitalization.\nJacoby notes that stereotypes and stigma can play into whether patients are believed about their pain and what treatment they receive. The paper cites recent research showing that minority patients in the U.S. receive less analgesia for acute pain, regardless of condition, when receiving emergency medical care.\nPreinjury pain did not differ across race and ethnicity, but Black participants had higher pain severity on average relative to white participants three and 12 months after injury. The group of factors most associated with outcome disparities at three and 12 months were those related to acute hospitalization: injury mechanism and severity, pain in the hospital, and length of hospital stay.\nRichmond says that, while this research is a big step forward, it does not fully explain the disparities, and other factors remain unknown, so there is still more work to be done.\nThis story was first published in Penn Today.

{"id": "696", "text": "I’m one of those who believes that what stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun. Sometimes, that good guy is a police officer, and sometimes, the good guy is a civilian. Leftists claim that the good guys’ contribution is so inconsequential that it doesn’t justify honoring citizens’ Second Amendment to keep and bear arms. New Mexico governor Michelle Grisham certainly agrees with that viewpoint. Leftists look to FBI statistics to support their arguments—so will you be surprised to learn that the FBI’s statistics are wrong? And, as always, that the error works to support leftist ideology and political positions?\nThe Crime Prevention Research Center (“CPRC”) has done a deep dive into the FBI’s Active Shooting Reports from 2014-2022 and discovered that the reports grossly underestimate the number of times armed civilians have stopped active shootings. The FBI says that civilians stop fewer than 5% of active shooters, while the actual data say that civilians, on average, stopped over 35% of active shooters, with the number going up to 63.5% if you include defensive use of guns outside of “gun-free guns” (which I call “shooting fish in a barrel” zones).\nThe essay opens by reminding readers of what happened in July 2022 in Greenwood, Indiana. A man opened fire in a shopping mall, killing three. He was stopped when 22-year-old Elisjsha Dicken, a licensed carrier, killed the shooter:\nWhile Dicken was praised for his courage and skill — squeezing off his first shot 15 seconds after the attack began, from a distance of 40 yards – much of the immediate news coverage drew from FBI-approved statistics to assert that armed citizens almost never stop such attackers: “Rare in U.S. for an active shooter to be stopped by bystander” (Associated Press); “Rampage in Indiana a rare instance of armed civilian ending mass shooting” (Washington Post); and “After Indiana mall shooting, one hero but no lasting solution to gun violence” (New York Times).\nHowever, honest data show that all those claims that good guys with guns don’t really matter were a case of “lies, damn lies, and Deep State statistics.”\nIn fact, the FBI has been pretty bad about collecting data from those instances in which good people stepped up and, at great risk to themselves, used their legal firearms to stop someone intent on murdering large numbers of innocent people. Thus, according to the FBI, of the 302 events that the FBI identifies as “active shootings,” armed citizens only stopped 14. (According to the FBI, an “active shooting” occurs in a public area when someone is intent upon killing and does kill multiple people.)\nAu contraire, says the CPRC:\nAn analysis by the CPRC identified a total of 440 active shooter incidents during that period and found that an armed citizen stopped 157. A previous report looked at only instances when armed civilians stopped what likely would have been mass public shootings. There were another 27 cases that we didn’t include where armed civilians stopped armed attacks, but the suspect didn’t fire his gun. Those cases are excluded from our calculations, though it could be argued that a civilian also stopped what likely could have been an active shooting event.\nThe FBI reported that armed citizens thwarted 4.6% of active shooter incidents, while the CPRC found 35.7%.\nThe problem with the FBI data is twofold: First, the FBI misclassified active shootings five times, whether by failing to acknowledge that it was an active shooting or by misidentifying that civilian’s identity. Second, and more significantly, the FBI missed 103 incidences that comported with its own definition of an “active shooting.”\nWhat also matters in understanding that the numbers are fundamentally flawed is that they roll together shootings in places where civilians can carry arms and those in which they can’t (those “fish in a barrel” situations):\nThere is yet another reason that these corrected percentages are biased downward as they ignore that about half of these attacks occur where guns are banned, so law-abiding citizens who obey those rules wouldn’t have a chance to stop them.\nThe FBI’s active shooting reports do not mention whether the attacks occur in gun-free zones. “The issue is that when places are posted as gun-free zones, law-abiding citizens obey those rules and would be unable to stop the attacks in those areas,” notes Carl Moody, a professor at William & Mary and the CPRC’s research director.\nThere is much more in the CPRC essay, so I urge you to review it yourself. I just wanted to focus on the top-line information: Once again, an organization that is hostile to a constitutional right manages (coincidentally, I’m sure) to pervert the available data in a way that supports its biases.\nGuns are an integral part of liberty. A government that is hostile to liberty is also hostile to guns, believing that only the government should control the great equalizer. This was/is the M.O. in Nazi Germany, Soviet Russia, Communist China, Communist Cuba, all of socialist Europe, etc. When only the government has guns, you live in a concentration camp, and that’s true no matter how nice a camp it seems.\nSource: Andrea Widburg, americanthinker.com/blog/2023/09/the_fbi_massively_erred_about_civilians_stopping_active_shooters.html", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

Here’s what a Google subscription looks like now.\nYouTube Premium subscription increases were introduced in the US some time ago, and now Google is also raising prices in Europe. This means that we also have to take into account the more expensive YouTube Premium in Poland. This is how much you have to pay the company now.\nYouTube Premium more expensive in Poland. The price jumped by a few zlotys\nSo far, the increase is taking place without much fanfare. However, foreign portals inform about international action concerning Poland, as well as countries such as Argentina, Australia, Austria, Chile, Germany and Turkey.\nThe YouTube Premium increase was to come into force on November 1, 2023. In Poland, the price was PLN 23.99 in July. The official website advertising YouTube Premium already displays the amount of PLN 25.99. The increase is therefore two zlotys.\nThe company’s communication to subscribers shows that the increase only applies to new users for now. In Australia, emails say this is the “first ever subscription increase” for the country. Additionally, customers currently paying for the service will be able to use the old price “for at least three additional months.” Eventually, however, they will have to come to terms with the higher price.\nIt is worth recalling that at the same time, YouTube has recently started penalizing the use of ad-blocking software on the platform. The increase in prices and the simultaneous removal of adblocks will most likely cause considerable dissatisfaction among users in a short time.\nYouTube raises prices in the US\nLike most internet companies, YouTube is introducing price increases gradually, rolling out more regions one by one. Previously, we wrote at Wprost.pl about the changes that took place in the USA.\nAt the end of July this year, the price of YouTube Premium in the United States increased by $2, i.e. slightly above PLN 8. Such an increase was more understandable because the service was introduced there already in 2015. In Poland, the value of the increase is lower, but the service was made available in our country only in 2019.\nWhat does YouTube Premium give you?

{"id": "705", "text": "Birding is not limited to any particular time of the year or the day. All you need is a lot of patience and a good pair of binoculars. This is something very familiar to birders--sometimes you'll find yourself motionless, on your belly, stuck in one position holding your breath for the fear of chasing away that rare sociable lapwing that have come thousands of miles away from Kazakhstan. You know how important that sighting is when you also know that they are critically endangered. India is a place of choice for many birds from countries far away. On one hand we have these migratory birds and then on the other we have birds so rare and endemic that you'd have to be lucky to spot them. Here are some of those rare birds of India you need to go see before it's too late.\nGreat Indian Bustard\nAs of 2018, about 150 of these birds are left in India. Shocking, but it's true for these beautiful birds. Due to the loss of habitat (dry grasslands and shrubs) these birds are facing the danger of extinction. They have only few pockets in India to call their home--Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan. What they don't like is an irrigated land and since most of their choice locations have been turned into cultivable land, their number have greatly diminished. They are a rarity no doubt but if you have the patience (and luck), you may find them in semi arid grasslands.\nAusten's Brown Hornbill\nIn India, they are found only in the forest of Namdapha National Park in Arunachal Pradesh. Outside the country, they are found in southern Vietnam and northern Thailand. Their restricted habitat makes them a rarity and on top of that, the dense woods of Namdapha makes it almost hard to find these birds. But if you are out looking to spot these winged beauties, look for holes left by the great slaty woodpeckers.\nThough not a resident bird, we are interested in social lapwings because they travel long distance from Russia and Kazakhstan to come to India during winter. Back home they breed on open grasslands. When in India they can be found in north western regions of India--Gujarat, Rajasthan, and parts of Haryana, Punjab and Uttar Pradesh. These birds are critically endangered and the rapid loss of habitat is one of the reasons behind it.\nSeen those cute and colourful tiny birds in cages Cute little pets, right Wrong Birds do not belong in cages, no matter how adorable they look and how good make your front porch look. Keeping birds as pets have pushed some species of birds to the brink of extinction from where coming back is nothing short of a miracle. One such bird is the green avadavat. These little green and yellow birds with black and white stripes are endemic to Indian subcontinent and their numbers are rapidly declining. Once abundant, now their population is restricted to central India, Rajasthan, parts of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal and Maharashtra. Away from cages if you want to spot them, agricultural lands are the best.\nThere are only two breeding regions for these big endangered birds--Assam and Cambodia. They love shallow lakes and garbage dumps and can be mostly seen scavenging around these parts. Assam is the best place where you can spot these birds. Earlier they used to be found in West Bengal but these days, you'd have to be lucky enough to spot them. Look for these birds during winter.\nOne thing is common for all grassland birds--their habitat is in constant threat. Be it agricultural or developing a land, open grasslands are the first to fall. And because of this reason, Bengal Floricans are now critically endangered. The species is native to Indian subcontinent, Cambodia and Vietnam. Less than a thousand of this species remain in the wild and the numbers are constantly in decline. In India they are found in the Terai regions of Assam, parts of Arunachal Pradesh and grasslands of Uttar Pradesh. It is extremely rare to find these birds because nowadays there are very limited grasslands but come March - August, which is their breeding season, there are chances to spot them.", "scores": {"score": 3, "score_transform_1": 5, "score_transform_2": 5, "score_transform_3": 0}}

This can prevent visitors, customers and employees from getting lost and becoming frustrated in the process.\nInterior signage for offices is a great brand building tool that helps share your business’ history, products or services in an attractive and professional way. It’s important to have a consistent color scheme and font throughout your marketing and messaging. This will provide the repetition necessary for your brand to take hold.\nWhether it’s a large office complex or educational facility, wayfinding signage is key for guiding people through your space. It puts visitors and customers at ease and increases their likelihood of becoming regulars.\nUsing a variety of signs, from directional signs to visual cues and directories, can help you lead visitors to their destinations. A well-planned indoor wayfinding sign package also includes identification signs, warning signs and regulatory signs that set boundaries in your building or facility.\nA directional sign is a vital form of wayfinding signage because it helps visitors find their destination quickly. Ideally, these are located at every intersection throughout the building or facility.\nDirectional signs should include clear and simple directions. If they don’t, visitors may get lost and backtrack.\nLikewise, room identification signs should be clearly marked to make sure even first-time visitors can locate rooms easily. In addition to displaying names and numbers, these signs should indicate where restrooms are located, elevators and other major areas of interest.\nSafety signage is a vital part of any office building or workplace. It lessens the risk of injuries to employees and non-employees and helps create a safer work environment.\nDepending on the type of business or facility you operate, you may need different types of safety signs. For example, laboratories typically have chemical, danger, caution and instruction signs, while construction and worksites often require emergency exit and fire fighting equipment signs.\nThe best sign materials are designed to withstand the rigors of industrial environments and are durable enough to stand up to forklift traffic, chemicals, water and UV rays. They also have a variety of fastening options, such as adhesive or mechanical fasteners.\nIn addition, OSHA and ANSI standards provide guidelines for the design, placement, shape and choice of warning symbols. These guidelines can be confusing for businesses, but the information provided by these standards is critical to reducing injuries and providing a safer workplace.\nWhen a customer enters your office building, it’s important that they feel comfortable and welcome. This is easily accomplished with lobby signs that are designed to make people immediately feel at ease.\nLobby signs can also help visitors and clients know what your business is all about. Many leading companies display slogans, mottos, and even their logo on lobby signs to let people know what they do and who they are.\nAnother reason why businesses choose to use lobby signs is because they help with wayfinding. These signs can direct customers to restrooms, elevators, and meeting rooms within an office complex.\nOffice lobby signs are made of a variety of materials, including metal, acrylic, PVC, and foam. The materials you select will depend on the look you are going for, as well as your brand goals and budget.\nADA signage is necessary to make sure that all customers and visitors have an easy time using your facility. It helps prevent fines, ensures that employees and people in your building have a positive experience, and helps to build a reputation for your business.\nWhether your business is large or small, ADA signs are an important component of making your establishment accessible to everyone. Adding raised characters and Braille to your signs doesn’t add much to the cost and it makes a big difference for people with blindness, mobility impairments, cognitive disabilities, hearing issues and more.\nADA regulations also include standards for fonts and spacing that must be followed closely when creating your signs. These include raising characters and fonts, having high contrast between text and background and placing them a certain height and space.", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}

{"id": "709", "text": "¶ … Managing All Stakeholders in the Context of a Merger Process\nReview of the Relevant Literature\nTypes of Mergers\nIdentifying All Stakeholders in a Given Business\nStrategic Market Factors Driving Merger Activity\nSelection Process for Merger Candidates\nSummary, Conclusion, and Recommendations\nThe Challenge of Managing All Stakeholders in the Context of a Merger Process\nMergers and acquisitions became central features of organizational life in the last part of the 20th century, particularly as organizations seek to establish and maintain competitiveness in an increasingly globalized economy (Nevaer & Deck, 1996). Mergers are generally described as being the formal joining or combining of two corporations or business (Prichett, 1987), although both the framework and the method of merger vary greatly. The reasons for mergers are different based on what a company is trying to accomplish. The acquiring firm may seek to eliminate a competitor; to increase its efficiency; to diversify its products, services, and markets; or to reduce its taxes. Methods used to accomplish mergers may range from friendly to hostile takeovers and may involve varying degrees of company integration (Fitzgibbon & Seeger, 2002).\nStatement of the Problem\nAccording to Letza, Kirkbridge and Sun (2004), the current debate and conceptualization concerning corporate governance has been focused on two perspectives: a shareholder perspective and a stakeholder perspective. Although advocates and supporters of each view seek to justify its superiority, rationality and universality, such analysts rarely pay attention to the fundamental conceptions, assumptions and presuppositions that underlie their perspectives which are less credible and valid in matching the continually changing practice of corporate governance.\nJustification of mergers are primarily based in three interrelated business themes; synergy, shareholder value, and enhanced competitiveness (Robinson & Peterson, 1995). Synergy would suggest that the two entities in combination may create new opportunities and efficiencies in that could not be realized in singular operation. Furthermore, synergy implies that the merging entities may be substantially different from one another in complementary ways. Competitiveness is grounded in the argument that larger organizations are necessary to compete effectively in an increasingly global market. This concept is closely connected to globalization pressures, suggesting that size is a requisite feature of a success in a globalized economy. Finally, synergy and competitiveness, it is argued, will lead to increased shareholder value in terms of higher stock prices.\nAlmost inevitably, however, mergers create some level of duplication and the need to eliminate some functions and associated jobs. For internal audiences, such as employees, merger is a source of high uncertainty and reduced job security. This level of uncertainty may result in employee stress and, in some cases, active resistance to the change (Fairhurst, Green & Courtright, 1994). When people are threatened, or perceive the potential for a threat, they may resort to a wide range of behaviors that overtly or covertly serve to undermine or sabotage organizational change (Robbins, 2001). This point is reiterated by House (1996), who points out that most people, just being people, are reluctant to any change in their routine. Many people will passionately challenge each and every effort on the part of management to alter any aspect of their duties; however, when this active resistance originates among key managers, there are more fundamental issues involved.\nFurthermore, such conditions are frequently more pronounced in global mergers through arguments about loss of American jobs. In virtually every case, though, the uncertainty and stress of a merger will result in at least a short-term loss of productivity. This uncertainty is most frequently resolved by providing stakeholders with clear statements of justification, articulation of motivation for the merger, and clear and compelling visions of the future (Ford & Ford, 1995). Clear, frequent, consistent and unambiguous messages, therefore, would be most desirable when facing a potential merger (Fitzgibbon & Seeger, 2002).\nMoreover, corporate leaders frequently engage in a process of framing, offering world views, perspectives or visions, in order to manage the larger meaning of a merger (Putnam & Fairhurst, 2000). In mergers, these models frequently represent the larger strategic visions of the future that link old structures, cultures and identities with new in persuasive ways. This strategic framing may draw on a number of linguistic and rhetorical devices including catchphrases, jargon, spin and metaphor (Putnam & Fairhurst, 2000, p. 89).\nPurpose and Importance of Study\nThe purpose of this study is to identify the key aspects related to managing all of the stakeholders in the context of a merger process. The importance of this study relates to the fundamental issue in any merger, which ultimately...\nAn effective merger permits the combined organization to achieve synergy and enhanced productivity relatively quickly, with minimum stress and uncertainty for the organizational participants. By sharp contrast, ineffective mergers may result in long-term loss of productivity through alienation of employees and other key stakeholders, turnover of valuable employees, layoffs and lost jobs, and high levels of stress and uncertainty for those who remain. Although a number of pre-merger variables such as the relative health of the individual companies, and the degree of fit influence effectiveness, the strategies of merger, including the surrounding discourse, must also be considered (Fitzgibbon & Seeger, 2002 p. 40).\nCompanies are a collective means by which people assert their self-interests. To achieve their personal and organizational goals, owners and managers need employees and customers. Employees become involved with companies to assert their self-interest and to satisfy personal, economic, and social goals. Customers assert their self-interests as they select among products and services. In this sense, companies can be discussed \"in terms of a set of organizational problems of different meaning and consequences for different organizational stakeholders. Problems are solved by sets of strategies and activities proceeding from different rationalities proposed by different stakeholder groups\" (Fitzgibbon & Seeger, 2002 p. 6). This approach is also compatible with Putnam and Fairhursts' concept of \"organizing as negotiation\" (p. 251).\nBecause persons and companies all tend to act in ways that affect each other's interests, organizations can be defined as negotiated enactments of stakeholder interests. Emphasizing this point, Mumby (1988) concluded, \"Organizations are not stable, fully integrated structures. Rather, they are the product of various groups with competing goals and interests. An organization services a group's interests to the extent that it is able to produce, maintain, and reproduce those organizational practices that sustain that group's needs\" (p. 166).\nEssential to this process are the individual decisions to seek, give, and hold stakes in the form of potential rewards or costs. The stakes, though, are negotiable and tend to affect the creation, maintenance, and dissolution of relationships. Timely stakeholder analyses provides researchers, managers and, in fact, affected stakeholders themselves, to see how organizational and individual behaviors enact self-interests and affect relationships (Heath, 1998).\nEach company communicates with many stakeholders. How well it communicates is crucial. In this era of increasing regulatory constraint, managers need to understand how to position their company to take advantage of or remediate the constraints imposed by various stakeholders, whether internal or external. Some companies have become increasingly sensitive to the stakes their workers hold. Workers are able to assert their interests through legal and regulatory actions. They can sue if they believe they have been discriminated against or treated badly. They can \"blow the whistle\" if the company is violating laws, regulations, or contracts. They can leave and join another company (Heath, 1994).\nPersons outside of organizations assert their self-interests by seeking and granting stakes. Neighbors in the locale of a company's plant may assert their self-interest by complaining about the health hazards it creates. How this self-interest is defined and asserted can impinge on the company's goals and operations. If the plant puts out pollutants that neighbors believe are harmful, they can exercise regulatory and legislative control of those emissions. In this regard, self-interests of neighbors are not simple -- not merely a matter of health, for instance. A plant in a community is a source of jobs -- a way its neighbors assert their self-interest. It can affect the tax base of the community and can be a matter of civic pride (Heath, 1994).\nOverview of Study\nThis study employs an action research approach to examine the question of how to best management all stakeholders' interests prior to, during and following a merger or acquisition. A review of the relevant and scholarly literature in Chapter 2 is followed by a description of the methodology and study approach in Chapter 3. An analysis of the data is provided by Chapter 4, followed by a summary, conclusion and recommendations in Chapter 5.\nReview of the Relevant Literature.\nBackground and Overview. According to Black's Law Dictionary, a merger is \"the fusion or absorption of one thing or right into another; generally spoken of a case where one of the subjects is of less dignity or importance than the other. Here the less important ceases to have an independent existence\" (1991 p. 988). When the merger occurs between two corporations, there is statutory guidance as to which one of the corporations survives and the other disappears. \"The absorption of one company by another,\" Black's adds, \"[with] the former losing its legal identity, and latter retaining its own name…\nManagement Styles Fool-proofing a service operation. In the banking industry, a significant service industry in any country, optimized operations are essential to ensure that the public has maximum confidence in the operators of this industry. Bank of America and its operations have been selected for discussion in this study. The bank has grown tremendously in the past few years. CEO, Ken Lewis realized that the bank could gain a wider market share\nMerger, Acquisition, And International Strategies Ford Corporation: The Volvo takeover It's imperative for the automotive companies to attain benefits of scale whilst developing latest products which is costing exceedingly high in the present business environment. Compared to the 90's the chances of attaining benefits of scale while saving costs has altered quite a bit. Model volumes have declined which creates difficulties for companies to attain economies of scale, while saving costs. Hence,\nOne specific phase that the author uses that can be applied to RBS is that innovations may force banks into decisions that are micro-functional, but macro-dysfunctional. In the case of RBS, leadership focus on reductionist metrics that offered increases in efficiencies in certain business functions, however by focusing on micro-functional areas of improvement the organization lost perspective on the macro benefits or losses incurred by a more comprehensive analysis.\nBancolombia: Talent, Culture, And Value Creation Management in Mergers Supporting evidence BIC Banco De Colombia Conavia Confinsura Change leader Analysis of case data - Efficiency Profitability Alternatives Alternative 1-Focus profitability and reducing cost-of-operations Alternative 2- Recreating source of competitive advantage Alternative 3- Franchising the rural branches Decision criteria Analysis of alternatives Selection of alternative Implementation Exhibit I Manifesto for Integration of Banco Colombia, Corfinsura, and Conavi Exhibit II Non-consolidated financial statements of Bancolombia Group Bancolombia Group was successfully led by the outgoing CEO Jorge Londorio until his retirement in January 2011.

The measure of energy is authoritative, so the two cases will do generally a similar harm given, obviously we look at situations when all the kinetic energy is spent.\nOne contrast that will be effectively obvious is that the weapon in the case of heavy bullet will recoil more.\nOne can consider energy assimilation as force times separation distance, and energy ingestion as a product of force and time.\nHenceforth, the heavier yet more slow bullet with a similar energy will venture to every part of a similar separation in the engrossing material, but since of bigger force, will take a more drawn out time doing it.\nIt will along these lines, additionally, give a more noteworthy \"kick\" to the object that absorbs.\nYou know that you sound better when you sing in the shower. This has to do with the amplification of frequencies that correspond to the standing-wave resonances of the shower enclosure. A shower enclosure is created by adding glass doors and tile walls to a standard bathtub, so the enclosure has the dimensions of a standard tub, 0.75 m wide and 1.5 m long. Standing sound waves can be set up along either axis of the enclosure. What are the lowest two frequencies that correspond to resonances on each axis of the shower? These frequencies will be especially amplified. Assume a sound speed of 343 m/s.\n\"Which gives the transverse acceleration of an element on a string as a wave moves along an x axis along the string?\"\nthe second derivative of y with respect to time gives the transverse acceleration of an element on a string as a wave moves along an x axis along the string\nThis is because the transverse wave movement of particles take place in direction 90° to direction of movement of the wave (x) itself, so second derivative of y with respect to time (t)is what will be required", "scores": {"score": 4, "score_transform_1": 5, "score_transform_2": 5, "score_transform_3": 0}}

But I am not sure how to relate that to the linear shape.\nIn what way(s) is(are) the structure of water similar to that of CHCl3? In what way is the structure of water different from that of CHCl3?\nSee explanation below\nIn both cases the central atoms, C in CHCl₃ and O in H₂O, are sp³ hybridized .\nSince they are sp³ hybridized we predict an angle between the H-C-Cl and H-O-H of 109.5 º ( tetrahedral ), but two of the sp³ orbitals in water are occupied by lone pairs.\nThese lone pairs do excercise more repulsion ( need more room ) than the bonds oxygen is making with hydrogen.\nAs a consequence of this repulsion the angles H-O-H are less than the predicted 109.5º in tetrahedra.

{"id": "713", "text": "Beginner’s Guide to Rhodes\nRhodes is the largest of the Dodecanese islands and also the 4th largest Greek Island overall after Crete (#1), Euboea (#2) and Lesbos (#3).\nThe island is home to more than 42 beautiful beaches, an international airport, stunning landscapes,\nBut Rhodes, to me, is much more than a historical Greek Island. It’s a place I feel at home when I visit.\nBelow, you’ll find all of my best recommendations when it comes to things to see, do and experience in Rhodes.\nBy the end of this article you’ll be able to craft your own journey to this incredible Greek island.\nBefore You Go: Travel Insurance\nWhen planning a trip to Greece and the Greek Islands your first priority should be to make sure you make a small investment towards your health and well being by considering an affordable travel insurance policy for your trip.\nNot only will this budget friendly travel insurance policy cover you if your bags are lost/stolen and if your flight is delayed/cancelled, but you’ll also be covered for all medical and injury related issues as well.\nLet’s face it. No parents, family or friends want to have to cover the cost of you getting medevaced home from Greece.\nUnfortunate things do happen.\nEspecially when you least expect it.\nDo yourself a favor and consider purchasing travel insurance coverage for your trip so you can rest assured that you’ll be taken care of in the event of a serious emergency in Greece.\nP.S. You won’t believe how reasonably priced this travel insurance is.\nHow to Get to Rhodes\nFlights to Rhodes:\nFlights to Rhodes are plentiful and can sometimes be cheaper than renting a car in many cities across the globe. No, seriously!\nOne of the reasons why I booked my second trip to Rhodes in July was due to the fact that I stumbled upon an insanely cheap round-trip flight from Athens to Rhodes for just 46 Euro (approx. $50 USD).\nYes, that’s right. $50 for a round-trip flight. To put things into perspective, a ferry from Athens to Rhodes costs 51 Euro each way and it takes nearly 16 times longer to get there (16 hrs).\nFlight from Athens to Rhodes: 50 minutes.\nFerry from Athens to Rhodes: 16 hours.\nWhen it comes to finding cheap flights to Rhodes, your best bet is to use a combination of Skyscanner & Google Flights to compare prices, check the flexible date calendars and ultimately find out which dates and fares work best for you.\nTip: Begin your flight search by using the Skyscanner engine embedded below.\nFerry to Rhodes:\nYou can also reach Rhodes by ferry if you prefer traveling by boat.\nJust remember that you will need to factor in that the ferry takes 16 times longer than a flight and is generally more expensive than flying.\nAll I’m saying here is that I advise you to exhaust all searches for flights to Rhodes before deciding to choose the ferry as your primary mode of transportation.\nWhen searching for ferries to Rhodes, your best bet is to use Ferries in Greece, a major greek ferry booking hub that helps more than 35,000 passengers get to and from the Greek isles each year.\nCheck Ferry Schedules & Prices:\nWhere to Stay in Rhodes\nI’ve spent time in four different Airbnb apartments in Old Town Rhodes during my two visits but instead of going into detail about all four, I’ll share my thoughts on my favorite apartment of the three.\nPlease note that all four apartments that I stayed in were owned/managed by the same Airbnb host and two of the apartments were identical to each other just on different floors.\nNote: You can find some budget accommodation options in Rhodes in my guide to Visiting the Greek Islands on a Budget.\nThe 3 Charities Euphrosyne apartment is a simple 1-bedroom/1 bath apartment located on the eastern edge of Old Town Rhodes.\nIt had all the amenities I could ask for including A/C, two burner stovetop, cable TV, Wi-Fi\nWhen it comes to location, the 3 Charities Euphrosyne apartment can’t be beat.\nIt’s tucked inside the castle walls of Old Town just steps from Lagani’s and Nimmos Traditional Restaurant, a 5 minute walk to the tourist ferry pier and a 15 minute walk from the Mandraki Marina.\nOverall I highly recommend this apartment to those of you who are planning on traveling to Rhodes in the near future.\nIf you try to book the 3 Charities apartment and it’s reserved, be sure to see if my second favorite apartment in Rhodes has availability.\n🔎 If this is your first time using Airbnb, we recommend you read our Insider’s Guide to Saving Money on Airbnb Apartments.\nRhodes Airbnb Apartments\nCozy Loft – 1 Bed / 1 Bath\nTraditional Greek House – 1 Bed / 1 Bath\nAzure Suite – 1 Bed / 1 Bath\nCentral Bath – 1 Bed / 1 Bath\nLuxury Apartment – 1 Bed / 1 Bath\nBeach Front Loft – 1 Bed / 1 Bath\nCenter Penthouse – 1 Bed / 1 Bath\n30 Rd Villa – 3 Bed / 2 Bath\nHotels in Rhodes\n- Semiramis Hotel Rhodes ( Hotels Combined / Booking.com )\n- Best Western Plus Hotel Plaza Rhodes ( Hotels Combined / Booking.com)\n- Spirit Of The Knights Boutique Hotel ( Hotels Combined / Booking.com)\nHow to Get Around Rhodes\nAirport taxis are plentiful and easy to find considering the Rhodes airport is quite small.\nAll you need to do is exit baggage and customs and head straight for the doors. Once outside you’ll see a big line of navy blue taxis ahead of you.\nHead to the front of the line and tell the driver your destination.\nIf you’re headed to Old Town (like I was), you should know that a taxi from the Airport to Old Town Rhodes cost a flat fee of 22 Euros so there’s no need to haggle your way into town once you land in Rhodes.\nThe 20-25km (12-15 mile) ride takes about 30 minutes and the first half of the journey brings you along the coastline where you’ll get a sneak peek at some of the beautiful beaches that run along the coast of Rhodes.\nNote: Taxis from the airport to other parts of Rhodes are all flat fees. There should be a sign outside next to where the taxis line up.\nGeneral taxi rides (not to/from the airport) can be quite expensive depending on your destination.\nIt’s usually a lot more affordable to rent a car or motorbike for the day/week instead of having to rely on expensive taxi fares.\nBeware: There are known scams that involve switching out bills quickly once a passenger pays.\nMy best advice for this type of situation is to say the bill out loud when you’re paying the driver.\nExample: Here’s 50 Euros. This way the driver knows that you acknowledge how much you’re paying and you know what you’re handing him/her. Don’t afraid to be verbal and if you do find yourself in a situation where you’ve been scammed, contact the nearest police officer.\nIf there’s none around you, be sure to let the driver know that you will call the police (even if you have no means to call them). The phone number for the Rhodes Police (from mobile): +30 2241 0 27423-23329\nBy Rental Car or Motorbike:\nThe best way to explore Rhodes is by car or by motorbike.\nCars can be rented for around 40 Euros/day while scooters can be rented for as low as 15-18 Euros/day.\nMore powerful scooters can cost around 30 Euros/day and are well worth it if you’re traveling with a passenger as they’re a lot more comfortable.\n- Recommended Motorbike Rentals: Thomas Rentals located across the road from Nimmos Traditional Restaurant in Old Town Rhodes.\n- Recommended Rental Car Agency: Any of the agencies in the plaza directly across from the Rhodes Tourist Ferry Port. See the map at the bottom of this post for more information.\nTip: Before returning your car or motorbike, don’t forget to fill the gas tank to the same level as when you received it. Otherwise you’ll end up being overcharged for fuel due to your mistake.\nMany people rent bicycles to explore Old Town and even destinations outside of Old Town such as Faliraki.\nI personally wouldn’t recommend renting bicycles in Rhodes.\nNot only is it burning hot during the summer but the roads are main roads from Old Town to Faliraki they really aren’t built to accommodate cyclists.\nNot to mention that there are some hills involved that you’ll need to push your bike up and take one look at the aggressive driving of the Greeks and you might quickly change your mind about renting bicycles in Rhodes.\nIf you’re wanting to cruise around Old Town and visit some beaches in Rhodes town then I recommend renting bicycles.\nOtherwise, don’t bother. It’s not worth the hassle or your life.\nExploring Old Town Rhodes\nAs I mentioned earlier, the Medieval Old Town of Rhodes is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\nUnfortunately, as those of you who have been following along with me over the years know, I’m not really into history so I can’t pretend to know much about the island, historically speaking. Sorry!\nWhat I can tell you are some of my favorite spots in Old Town Rhodes.\nRecommended Restaurants in Old Town Rhodes:\n- Hermes – One of the most affordable restaurants in Old Town run by a very friendly man named Hermes.\n- Not too many tables here so be sure to arrive early if you’re planning on having dinner here. Food is delicious, portions are huge and the prices are as cheap as it gets. The chicken souvlaki plate is to die for. Oh, and you can get giant beers for just 2 Euro. Great place to start your evening before heading out to the bars.\n- Odyssey Restaurant – This place offers up delicious traditional Greek dishes. This restaurant is a must if you’re looking for traditional Greek food and the prices are very reasonable considering they’re located in a touristy part of town. Try the Giouvetsi and sip your free shot of Ouzo at the end of your meal. Located in the center of Old Town.\n- Nimmos Traditional Restaurant – Great traditional Greek food and seafood. Good prices, decent portions and friendly service. Easy walk if you’re in Old Town.\n- Saffron – This restaurant is not located in Old Town but I had to mention it anyway because it was one of my best meals in Rhodes. Saffron is an Indian restaurant located in Rhodes town (not Old Town but close enough to walk) and they offer up some of the most delicious Indian food I’ve had to date. Saffron is one of the highest rated restaurants in Rhodes according to TripAdvisor and rightfully so. I had the Butter Chicken w/ Saffron rice with naan bread and it blew my damn mind. If you’re staying in Old Town you could make the 20-25 minute walk or take a taxi for approximately 5 Euro.\nThings to See and Do in Old Town Rhodes:\n- Explore the Medieval City – Old Town Rhodes is known to be one of the best preserved and most extensive medieval towns in all of Europe. Take advantage of this by exploring all of its little nooks and crannies. Walk around the outside of the castle walls, wander the maze of alleyways, visit the monuments and museums and stroll down the avenue of the Knights.\n- Romantic After Dinner Spot – Take your significant other out to the jetty along the castle wall that faces the tourist harbor and grab yourself a seat on the bench facing the sea. Note: This spot is pretty hidden but you can find the location easily if you follow the point on my custom map at the end of this post.\n- Pili Agiou Pavlou – Visit this spot to snap some really unique photos while looking through the old castle walls that face out towards the sea. See the map at the end of this post for the exact location.\n- Treat yourself to a gelato – Grab a 1 Euro cone at the gelato stand on the edge of Mandraki Harbor.\n- Fresh Catch – Watch the fishermen catch fish at sunset and take photos of the boats entering Mandraki harbor.\nLindos is both a town and archaeological site located approximately 58 km (36 mi) south of Old Town Rhodes.\nGetting to Lindos – Lindos is easily accessible by car and motorbike although if it’s blazing hot out and you have the extra money to burn, go for the rental car option over the bike. Trust me, I’ve done the ride to Lindos on both a motorbike and a car and the car was much more comfortable and a hell of a lot less exhausting. That being said, I would definitely take a motorbike there again if it wasn’t the peak of summer. A taxi from Rhodes to Lindos is pretty much out of the question as it would cost a fortune.\nThe Acropolis – The Acropolis that sits high above the town of Lindos is absolutely amazing and is a must see if you’re looking for some of the best views in all of Rhodes. One thing I should mention is that the climb up to the acropolis requires you to be somewhat active and able to climb stairs, lots of them. The trail begins through town and slowly but surely starts to get steeper as you climb the hill towards the acropolis. Once there, you’re rewarded with historical buildings dating back to 300 BC. More information on the Lindos Acropolis can be found here.\nSt. Pauls Bay – The beautiful bay seen in the photo above is known as St. Paul’s Bay and it’s even more incredible in person than it is in this photo. Don’t forget your camera!\nBest Beaches in Rhodes\nIf you’re interested in spending some time soaking up the rays at the best beaches in Rhodes, you’re going to have quite a tough time choosing between all the beautiful beaches as just about every beach in Rhodes has different characteristics and each one seems to be more amazing than the next.\nThis video below features 29 of the best beaches in Rhodes.\nAnthony Quinn’s Bay – (Photo shown above) Anthony Quinn’s bay is one of the most beautiful bays I’ve ever witnessed with my own eyes. The bay is located 17km (10 mi) south of Old Town Rhodes and offers some incredible photo opportunities to say the least.\nThe beach at Anthony Quinn’s bay is one of the best beaches in Rhodes (IMO).\nGet there early if you want to snag a sun chair and umbrella and enjoy wading around the bright blue and green water. Amazing!\nFor the best views of Anthony Quinn’s Bay from above, head on up to the windy road that leads up the hill just north of the bay and you’ll find a spot where you can sit and enjoy the virtually 180 degree views of Rhodes and its coastline.\nThis is hands down one of my favorite spots in all of Rhodes.\nAfter a long day of driving my motorbike in the blazing hot sun, I stood at the edge of the cliff with Anthony Quinn’s bay beneath me and I cracked open a can of Cayman Jack.\nIt was so relaxing and refreshing to kick back and sip on a margarita with views like this surrounding you.\nTsambika Beach (or Tsampika) – (Photo shown above) Tsampika beach is located 30km (18 mi) south of Old Town Rhodes and is a great place to spend the day in the sun.\nNote: There is a small section where nudists congregate on Tsampika beach. For the best views of Tsampika Beach, head on up to the Panagia Tsampika Psili Dimou Archagkelou, another one of my favorite spots to take photos in Rhodes.\nRhodes Beach – This is your standard beach located on the north western tip of Rhodes, just a few steps from the infamous “Bar Street”. I honestly don’t even know the name of this beach so I’m naming it Rhodes beach.\nLakido Beach – Just opposite Anthony Quinn’s Bay is Lakido beach. It’s literally 3 minutes walking distance from Anthony Quinn’s bay so visiting both beaches in a day is totally doable. As a matter of fact, I would highly recommend visiting both if you get the chance.\nFaliraki Beach – I did not personally visit this beach but thought I should mention it considering it’s one of the most popular tourist spots on the island of Rhodes. I’m not sure why people stay here but I assume it’s due to the fact that most tourists that stay in Faliraki are there on a sun holiday (aka package holiday) which includes your flights, hotels, and sometimes even food at deeply discounted rates. In my opinion, Faliraki is way too far away from Old Town. Again, I’m only mentioning it because it’s a popular beach destination but do your homework before deciding to stay here. Oh and I should also mention that I stopped by the beach briefly and I have to say there are a lot better beaches on Rhodes.\nWell, I hope you guys found this post helpful.

{"id": "720", "text": "The majority of employers support an increase in the statutory minimum wage – as long as it is accompanied by additional support for skills investment, a survey has found.\nThe poll of more than 1,000 businesses by the Learning and Work Institute and the Carnegie UK Trust – conducted at the start of the coronavirus outbreak – found 54 per cent supported the government’s policy of increasing the national living wage (NLW) to two-thirds of the median income by 2024, which is currently estimated to be £10.50 an hour. Just 9 per cent opposed the move.\nThe report – The Future of the Minimum Wage: the Employer Perspective – found the majority of employers did not think the increase would have a negative impact on either their business or UK employment more broadly, with 54 per cent saying a higher minimum wage could help boost UK productivity.\n- Government pledges further hike to national living wage\n- Low-paid workers bearing the brunt of Covid fall in employment, study finds\n- Why are so many employers failing to pay the minimum wages?\nCurrently the living wage – the statutory minimum wage for those over the age of 25 – is £8.72 an hour. The national minimum wage for those aged between 21 and 24 is £8.20 an hour, dropping to £6.45 for those aged 18 to 20, and £4.55 for those under the age of 18.\nGerwyn Davies, public policy adviser at the CIPD, said it was particularly important to listen to the views of the low-paid sectors, including hospitality and retail, given they are likely to be disproportionately affected by any minimum wage increase: “The report is right to say that the NLW has had a modest negative impact on employment levels to date overall, although there have been some job losses in some low-wage sectors.”\nDavies also cautioned about linking minimum wage increases to higher productivity: “Some employers from affected sectors are reporting to us that the latest [national living wage] increases have led to cuts in skills investment and had a negative impact on career progression.”\nGet more HR and employment law news like this delivered straight to your inbox every day – sign up to People Management’s PM Daily newsletter\n“We also know that work intensification has been the main productivity response to recent rises, which is not sustainable, especially in the current climate,” Davies said, adding that it would be sensible for the Low Pay Commission (LPC), which advises the government on the statutory minimum wage, to increase the minimum wage in line with inflation “to help ease the wage bill pressure on struggling sectors”.\n“If ever there was a time for the LPC to apply the emergency brake, it is now,” he said.\nDouglas White, head of advocacy at the Carnegie UK Trust, said it was encouraging that the majority of employers supported a higher minimum wage: “Even before the onset of the pandemic, there were too many workers struggling on low pay.\n“The economic challenges caused by Covid-19 mean it is even more important that future decisions around the minimum wage are ambitious in delivering better pay for low-paid workers, while recognising the real challenges that many businesses are experiencing and providing them with essential support,” said White.\nThe report also found that half (50 per cent) of businesses felt they would not need to make any changes in response to the additional cost of a higher minimum wage.\nA fifth (22 per cent) said they would pass the cost on to consumers; 15 per cent would hire fewer members of staff; and 10 per cent would increase the use of temporary or flexible contracts with the same proportion saying they would reduce staff benefits.\nHowever, the majority of employers said government support would be necessary to help manage an increase in the minimum wage. More than a third (37 per cent) of employers said they would welcome help investing in skills and training, while a third (33 per cent) said they would like to see any living wage increase to be accompanied by a temporary reduction in national insurance contributions.", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}
{"id": "721", "text": "What to Expect When Closing on a House\nWhat to Expect When Closing on a HouseJune 30, 2020\nCongratulations, you are closing on your new home this week! While closing on a house may be the last chapter in your home buying journey, it is important to take time to make sure everything is in place to ensure a smooth, trouble-free closing process.\nHow long does closing on a house take exactly? The closing process itself is officially completed in one day. However, several steps must be taken between the day your offer is accepted and the day you are officially a homeowner. Read on to learn what to expect the week of closing so that the process runs smoothly.\nMake Sure Your Closing Contingencies Are Complete\nAt this point, you should have completed all major tasks and prepared for closing contingencies—after all, these need to be taken care of for the contract to become legally binding. This includes a full home inspection, an appraisal and a final walkthrough. You will also need to finalize your insurance and loan documents.\nTypically, the final walkthrough will take place within 24 hours of your closing date. Bring your contract to the final walkthrough to make sure the current state of the home exactly matches the originally agreedupon state.\nDuring the walkthrough, be sure to test and double-check everything. If you see any last-minute damages, your bank may not approve your loan until those are taken care of. You could also ask the seller for a credit if the damages cannot be settled before closing.\nHave Your Financials in Order\nOnce you receive your closing disclosure, you will typically have three days to review everything before you sign your final closing paperwork. This form provides final details about the mortgage loan you have chosen and your closing costs. Review each cost very carefully—this will also give you an idea of how much you can expect to pay during closing.\nNote that you probably will not know the exact amount you will be paying until you are actually in the process of closing on your house. It is good to budget a large buffer and bring your personal checkbook in case any unexpected costs come up.\nMake sure everything is in place to ensure a smooth processing of your down payment. If there is any chance your bank may delay the payment, bring your down payment to closing in the form of a cashier’s or certified check.\nAccording to Realtor Mag, about 46% of delays experienced when closing on a house are caused by financing issues. The most common issue? Buyers taking on too much credit before their closing date. This is why it is extremely important to avoid making any large purchases in the days prior to closing on your house. Your lender will also do last-minute credit checks, so significant changes can put your loan at stake.\nLastly, be sure to have all your documentation to make sure the final approval on your loan is successful. Make a checklist of all the documents you will need, including:\n- Income statements (pay stubs, W2 forms)\n- Asset statements (bank accounts, investments)\n- Insurance information\n- Copy of contract\n- Divorce decree, child support/alimony information, bankruptcy papers (if applicable)\nPreparing for Closing Day\nYou have officially made it to closing day! There are only a few more steps you need to take until your new home is ready for move-in.\nWhat to Bring\nYour title company representative and mortgage loan officer should provide you with a detailed checklist of everything you will need to bring to closing. Here are a few essential items you do not want to forget:\n- Any outstanding documents/paperwork for the title company or mortgage loan officer.\n- Your certified or cashier’s check made payable to the title or closing company.\n- Your personal checkbook, in case any last-minute changes or items that are not included in the settlement come up.\n- Home inspection reports.\n- Bidding negotiations and all documents related to the asking price.\nWhat Happens at Closing\nClosing on a house is a long and detailed process, so be prepared to spend as long as a couple of hours completing the process. You will need to sign at least 50 to 100 pages of documentation. While it might be tempting to skim through them, it is important to carefully read through each page, as these are binding legal agreements.\nThe people involved in your appointment may vary, and oftentimes sellers take care of their paperwork separately ahead of time, but you should expect most of the following people to be present at closing:\n- The escrow/closing agent\n- The attorney\n- A title company representative\n- A mortgage lender\n- Real estate agents\nAfter you pay your remaining closing costs and review the seller’s signed property transfer documents (if they’re not present at closing), you will sign a settlement statement, mortgage note (legally stating your promise to repay the loan) and mortgage or deed of trust. The title company will then register the new deed in your name.\nThe process of closing on your home is not a lightning-fast process, but each little signature is all worth it when you are able to step into your new home!\nClosing on a house means that you are one step closer to home ownership. Are you ready to start the journey of looking for your new home?

{"id": "724", "text": "A resolution introduced to City Council today would forgive up to $115 million in medical debt for up to 24,000 Pittsburghers.\nPittsburgh City Councilmember Bobby Wilson introduced the bill, which would have the city partner with national nonprofit RIP Medical Debt to purchase and discharge eligible healthcare debt. The organization has determined that 24,000 Pittsburghers meet the criteria for debt relief under the terms of the bill, which requires recipients have accrued at least some of their debt since the onset of the pandemic.\n“Healthcare debt [is] the most common form of debt on consumer credit reports and is the leading cause of personal bankruptcy in the United States of America,” Wilson said in a press conference this morning, “However, healthcare debt differs from every other type of consumer debt in that people do not plan to get sick or hurt, and when they do get sick or hurt, getting healthcare is not just necessary, but may well be a matter of life and death.”\nAccording to RIPMD’s website, the organization “buy[s] debt in bundles, millions of dollars at a time at a fraction of the original cost” and forgives the debt with “no tax consequences or penalties to consider” if the debtor makes less than four times the federal poverty line for their household size or has medical debt that exceeds five percent of their income.\nThe proposed effort would be funded by $1 million of the city’s American Rescue Plan Act allocation. Pittsburgh has received $335 million in total through this federal COVID-19 relief funding allocation.\nWilson argues the plan would bring outsized benefits in proportion to its cost.\n“Providing debt relief to Pittsburghers at this scale, where $1 can discharge up to $115 of burdensome medical debt, is just plain common sense,” Wilson adds.\nMohammed Burny, Wilson’s chief of staff, tells Pittsburgh City Paper the resolution is patterned after successful initiatives in Toledo, Ohio and Cook County, Illinois that used ARPA funds to discharge medical debt.\nBased on the scale of those projects, Burny says, “We were planning on allocating a significantly larger sum of money,” but were pleasantly surprised to find fewer debtors under the RIPMD income cap than they expected.\n“We actually think, per capita, we’re better off than most Rust Belt cities,” in terms of outstanding medical debt, Burny says.\nPrevious local debt relief initiatives may have contributed have contributed to Pittsburgh's reduced rates of medical debt.\n“Since 2019, there have been multiple philanthropic initiatives in Western Pa.” to eliminate medical debt, Burny says, organized by churches and nonprofit organizations.\nAccording to February 2022 data compiled by the Urban Institute, seven percent of all households in Allegheny County have medical debt that has been referred to collections.\n“Anyone is just one medical emergency away from becoming homeless,” assays Councilwoman Erika Strassburger, who is a co-sponsor of the legislation. “The bills pile up and it becomes untenable.”\nWilson says the resolution is also co-sponsored by Councilmembers Daniel Lavelle, Ricky Burgess, Anthony Coghill, and Barb Warwick.

The manner in which these reports are presented is fascinating...full of emotion, flourishes and hyperbole:\nGhost Allegedly Slaps Cops’ Faces\nOne Hundred Dollars Reward For Proof Happenings Are Not Supernatural\nNew Castle News, New Castle, Pennsylvania - 18 February 1922\nHALIFAX, N.S., Feb. 18 – The famous ghost of Antigonish county today had won the second round of its fight with Agnostics and entered upon its third.\nFirst, it drove Alex McDonald from his farm in Caledonia Mills in midwinter, with a tale of mysterious fires and cattle that apparently had been stricken by a supernatural hand.\nLast night it sent Detective “Peachie” McDonald of the provincial police and Harold Whidden, a reporter, back to Halifax, satisfied by their investigation that the ghost exists and had slapped them.\nToday the cross hockey club, of Antigonish, which is here for a game with Dalhousie, announced that two of its members had been selected to wage war against the spook by continuing the investigation of the haunted house, which has had all Nova Scotia agog.\nSo certain is Mr. Whidden of his conclusions, he offered to give $100 to the first person who can prove that supernatural causes are not responsible for the uncanny happenings at the McDonald homestead.\nBizarre Apparition Entertains the Masses\nStalks in an Auburn Oat Field - Draws Crowds to Scene\nAll Attempts to Capture the Spectre Unsuccessful\nMysterious Figure Swings a Lantern Like a Brakeman and Boldly Confronts Spectators, But Vanishes If Approached\nSyracuse, New York, Sunday Herald - 1 August 1897\nAuburn, July 31 - One evening nearly a week ago the young son of Michael O'Hara put his head out of the window of his father's house in lower State street and allowed his eyes to wander across the street into the field of waving grain owned by ex-Mayor Mortimer V. Austin. Suddenly O'Hara gave a blood-curdling yell, and his face blanched as he saw rising from the center of the oat field a strange apparition. It was apparently the figure of a man clothed entirely in white. The ghostly figure stalked across the oat field, swinging a lantern in its hand. It advanced to the fence facing the road, and after flourishing his lantern up and down several times like a brakeman signaling a railroad train, the white figure gave a tremendous bound into the air and vanished from sight.\nThe youth managed to gain strength enough to crawl back into bed. The next morning he told the story of the specter to his parents, who in turn told it to the neighbors, and the neighbors gave it to the local newspapers, and the news was heralded far and wide. The next evening 500 or more people congregated in the highway in front of the O'Hara residence and waited for the apparition to appear. The board fence in front of the oat field was lined with spectators.\nAbout 10 o'clock the ghost appeared, carrying his lantern with him. The specter made its appearance, apparently rising from the ground at the foot of a beech tree which stands at the west end of the field. The white-robed figure dodged in and out, seen at one minute, the next lost to sight. After continuing this performance for a few minutes, the figure advanced boldly toward the astounded spectators.\nIt came on with a bounding movement, similar to that made by a kangaroo while in motion. When within a few feet of the spectators, the ghost stood motionless for a second, and after waving the lantern in the air three or four times, suddenly vanished from sight. This is the way a young man of unquestioned veracity tells it.\nAn Attempt to Capture\nThe next night an attempt was made to capture his ghostship. Thirteen (an unlucky number) of Auburn's bravest young men took up their position among the branches of the beech tree, from under which the ghost appears. The young sentinels were not afraid of ghosts. Oh, no! and they chuckled to themselves, thinking of what fun they would have in the capture.\nAbout 300 or 400 people stood in the street. The ghost appeared about 10 o'clock. It arose as usual from the ground at the foot of the beech tree. Its appearance caused an unusual commotion among the brave young men in the tree. One of the would-be captors fainted, while his companions clutched more tightly the branches of the tree and with awe-stricken faces waited for the thing to pass on. His ghostship did not carry his lantern on this occasion.\nThe following night another and more determined party of men attempted to capture the ghostly visitant. They chased it around the oat field, but could not capture it. Just as one of the pursuers would attempt to place a hand upon the spectre it would suddenly vanish, only to reappear again a second later in a distant part of the field.\nIt is a motley crowd which gathers nightly to catch a glimpse of his ghostship. Some times it appears and then again it doesn't. It is a very uncertain ghost to gamble on. Old, gray-haired men, as well as barefooted, rosy-cheeked children, gather in front of the oat field and keep nightly vigils, waiting for the apparition to appear. Young men and their sweethearts make the scene a trysting place, and they come on foot and on bicycles to wait and watch. Parents even bring their children out to see the ghost. The fences on both sides of the street have been torn down by the mob, and the oat field is stamped down, as if a herd of Western steers had passed over it. It has been roughly estimated that fully 4,000 people have visited the field during the week.\nThe scene where the alleged ghost appears is inside the city limits, yet the authorities have taken no action in regard to the matter. Chief of Police MacMaster is waiting for the property owners of that section to enter complaint. There are no city ordinances which prohibit orderly and respectable ghosts from taking up their abode in an oat field or anywhere else.\nNo Ordinance Against Ghosts\nIn fact the framers of the city's by-laws neglected to enact ordinances under which a ghost could be apprehended and punished for his temerity in stalking abroad at night with a lantern in its hand. There are many theories as to the identity of the ghostly phenomenon. Some claim that it is the spirit of a restless bicycle rider who was electrocuted during the dark ages for not having his lamp lighted after sundown. That during the revival of the bicycle craze in modern times he is doomed for a certain number of nights to appear with his lantern as a warning to those wicked riders who will persist in letting their lamps blow out on dark and stormy nights. Some say that it is the spirit of a man who was murdered in the oat field many years ago. The criminal records of the county fail to show when the alleged murder was committed, or who was the victim, consequently that story will not hold.\nA man named Murphy, residing in State street in the vicinity of the haunted field, says that the specter is the Murphy family's cat. Thomas is a beautiful white feline, who occasionally rambles away from home to meet his enamorita in the haunted field.\nThe theory, however, is not credited by those who have seen the specter, which has been described to be from six to ten feet tall. As Murphy's cat never was, or never will be, ten feet in height the probabilities are that Thomas is not the guilty party.\nThe O'Haras don't know who or what it is, and what's more, don't like to talk about the matter for publication. One of the neighbors said that the specter is a young girl who resides in York street. The young girl in question indignantly denies the accusation and says that if she ever catches her accuser face to face she will scratch his eyes out. This at once establishes her innocence. Officer Titus, who patrols the State street beat, says that the ghost is a man with a white sheet over his head. Officer Titus started out to investigate the matter a few days ago and to find out if possible who the joker might be. In less than forty-eight hours he was told by as many as fifty of the residents who the guilty party was. Strange to say, every one of the fifty informers were in turn accused by each other of the heinous offense and here the matter rests.\nThe specter appeared again about 11:15 o'clock to-night and nearly frightened the wits out of a large number of spectators by its grotesque actions. The figure apparently dropped from the clouds into the midst of a crowd of young men, who were seated under the beech tree smoking cigarettes. The smokers dropped their cigarettes and with a screech fled from the field with the strange apparition in hot pursuit. The phantom chased the men into the middle of the street, and then, with a peculiar bounding gait, returned to the field and then vanished from sight.\nJersey Town Sees Ghost\nWeird Apparition Keeps Nervous Residents Home at Night\nThe Indianapolis Star, Indianapolis, Indiana - 19 March 1911\nBEVERLY, N.J. March 18 – Bridgeboro, the home of witchlore and ghost scares, had another sensation, which the residents take seriously, and after each nightfall the streets are deserted. Joe Johnson and a party of friends, passing what is known as the Paxson Pits a few nights ago, were confronted by a dwarf which they declared climbed out of a pit. For a minute it lingered and then, giving a piercing screech, vanished into the woods. Other witnesses, farmers of unquestionable veracity, substantiate Johnson’s story.\nThe old residents say that years ago a reserved man, who lived on the outskirts of the village, and whose name never was learned, as the family would not mingle with the villagers, had a deformed son. The man was driving along the country road, when the carriage was supposed to have overturned and the child fell into the pit and broke his neck. The version of the accident was accepted, but wild rumors were afloat at the time. Those who have seen the specter describe it as a boy whose head seems to hang limp upon his chest.\nChoked By A Ghost\nPennsylvania Woman Believes Her Dead Husband Visits Her\nLogansport Pharos, Logansport, Indiana - 19 March 1901\nCarbondale, Pa. March 19 - The ghost of John Kinnie has visited his wife’s bedroom twice within a week, and she fears it may be the cause of her death. Each time the phantom visitor choked her, and her neck is said to have black and blue marks caused by long thin fingers. Kinnie died a year ago.\nJust as the clock tolled midnight last Monday, Mrs. Kinnie says, she heard the front door open. Then there were footsteps in the hall. She hastily locked her bedroom door and listened in fright. A few minutes later her neck was encircled by a hand. She swooned, and when morning came was found on the floor in a dead faint. The same thing happened Wednesday night. The only explanation the doctor can offer is that Mrs. Kennie choked herself while sleeping. She is in a serious condition.\nThe Oxford Book of Victorian Ghost Stories\nLate Victorian Gothic Tales (Oxford World's Classics)\nGhost-Seers, Detectives, and Spiritualists: Theories of Vision in Victorian Literature and Science (Cambridge Studies in Nineteenth-Century Literature and Culture)", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}

The kind that prompts you to, pause in amazement to ask yourself why nobody ever thought of this before, tidy your desk, and start searching for advice on how to turn your brainwave into a profitable business. But where should you really begin?\nBuilding a business is one of the greatest journeys you can embark upon. You can’t expect success overnight. Behind the meteoric rise of each ‘Uber for this’ and ‘Airbnb for that’, there are rivers of sweat, oceans of tears and months of lost sleep.\nThe foundation of a viable business is to identify a problem and provide a good solution – or a better one than your would-be customers can currently find. You should begin by thinking through your business plan and doing your market research. Be prepared to make changes to the product and to redefine your target market in response to your findings.\nYour next step is to get the infrastructure of success in place. Become an expert by studying up on specialist sector information. Get get a professional-looking website, clean up your social media, contribute to relevant discussions online and in person: you should be seen as an authority.\nSelect the platforms you’ll use to market your product – does it need a video demonstration, or are you the author and sage behind the next hit eBook? Then, get to grips with Google. You’ll need to produce regular, relevant content for your site to rank highly, and understand how paid ads work in order to run campaigns or instruct an agency.\nThink this summary sounds simple enough? You already know the roadmap to business stardom will be peppered with potholes. Here are six tips to prepare:\n1. Get to work\nSuccess is directly proportional to the effort you put in. You’ll be competing for funding and customers with many other companies. Most will have more capital and manpower than your business might see for another decade. If you want to get on level footing, the only way is to grind. Use size to your advantage.\nThere’s no middle-management or bureaucracy to prevent you from experimenting with new tactics or tailoring services to a particular client’s requirements. Bonus tip? Don’t quit your day job right away. It’s incredible how much time you can free up on evenings and weekends by reducing your Netflix consumption.\n“A business has to be involving, it has to be fun, and it has to exercise your creative instincts.” – Richard Branson\n2. Network, network, network\nMingling, schmoozing, hobnobbing – it doesn’t come naturally to everyone. Maybe it seems pointless, or pushes you out of your comfort zone at first, but networking is an extremely valuable use of your time. Polish your LinkedIn presence, go to business networking events, reach out to people you could learn from. Join discussion forums and contribute to them.\nYou could even consider applying to startup incubator programs such as TechStars, which offer a curated programme of introductions to both mentors and investors. You can’t predict when one of these contacts will offer a helping hand, but relationship building is key to securing support in your hour of need.\n3. Tighten the purse strings\nStartups don’t secure their founders a steady stream of income. There will be weeks when you’re flush, and months when your dreams of entrepreneurial success are eclipsed by dreams of a dinner that isn’t ramen. Without the privilege of a reliable income, life is easier to navigate when you’re equipped with budgeting smarts and a steely will. Get used to living within your means. Your salary cut will ultimately translate into a runway extension for your startup.\n4. The customer is (still) king\nYour brilliance and expertise can’t fund your startup by themselves! Customers put food on your table and sustain the viability of your business. Listen to what they want from you. Be prepared to tailor your offering to their needs. If you get an opportunity to deliver results for someone – seize it. You can offer them a perk no big business can match: flexibility.\n5. Shortcuts leave you short-changed\nIf a job is worth doing, it’s worth doing right first time. Don’t give investors a chance to pick holes in your business proposition by spending time and money on work that needs to be re-done. Website bugs or a ‘content farm’ blog can damage the functionality of your business as well as your reputation.\nSure, you’ll get to the stage where your business is ready for a re-brand or an experienced hire brings in the knowledge to optimise your content, but there’s a difference between being keen to improve versus tolerating shoddy work. Get the best you can buy at every stage of growth.\n“Don’t start a company unless it’s an obsession and something you love. If you have an exit strategy, it’s not an obsession.” – Mark Cuban\n6. Know your ‘why’\nWhen the going gets tough, the tough get going. But how can you cultivate this toughness? In the early stages, you may not have a co-founder or employee to share the struggle. There will be no team to carry you through phases of crippling doubt. Whether you need to adjust the feng shui of your home office, admit that breaks are crucial to your wellbeing or build opportunities to socialise with likeminded individuals into your schedule, take time to work out the foundations of your mental fortitude.\nUnderstand your ‘why’ – the reason behind your passion that gives you a true sense of purpose. Then, work to cultivate a balance. You can’t do everything, but you can make time for family, exercise, and the little things that save your sanity. The ability to self-motivate will serve you in every area of life, whether business is your vocation or not.", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}
{"id": "730", "text": "Careful composition is an essential part of good photography, but even once you understand the image-arrangement fundamentals, you may struggle to capture shots that are sufficiently striking.\nIf you feel that your images are bland and/or unoriginal, then I highly recommend you learn how to work with diagonals, which can dramatically improve your compositions. With the proper application of this technique, you can create breathtaking photos that are full of movement – and because diagonals aren’t a commonly used image element, they can help your shots stand out from the crowd.\nIn this article, I discuss everything you need to know about diagonal arrangements, and I offer plenty of tips and examples along the way!\nDiagonals in Photography:\nWhat Are Diagonals in Photography?\nDiagonals refer to tilted lines in your images, like this:\nThey can begin at the edges of the frame and move toward the center:\nOr they can begin in the middle of the frame and stay firmly within the center of the composition:\nThe key thing to remember is that diagonals must be slanted. While straight lines can make for very compelling photography, slanted lines offer something different – which is why it’s worth drawing a distinction between the two.\nWhy Are Diagonals Useful?\nSlanted lines are powerful compositional elements because they create visual flow. In other words, they move the viewer’s eye through the frame (from one end of the line to the other).\nSo if a diagonal begins at the edge of a composition, it draws the viewer in, and then it takes them on a journey all the way to the other end.\nNow, you might be wondering: What’s so great about visual flow?\nVisual flow is a fundamental part of photographic composition. If you can move the viewer through the frame, they’ll engage with the photo for longer, they’ll appreciate it more, and they’ll become (hopefully) rather captivated.\nVisual flow is also important for another reason: It directs the viewer toward the most essential part of the photo while keeping them away from the less essential parts. Put another way, visual flow helps focus the viewer so that they’re able to understand a photo and what it’s about.\nAnd that’s why diagonals in photography are so useful; they guide the viewer, keep them engaged, and take the viewer where you – the photographer – want them to go!\nYou might be wondering: Where do diagonals actually come from? Well, if you look carefully enough, you can find them everywhere – especially because a straight line, positioned properly within the frame, automatically becomes a diagonal.\nFor instance, you might find a fallen tree in a forest, which initially presents itself as a straight line. But if you change your angle, it immediately becomes a compelling diagonal, stretching from the bottom corner of the frame to the top opposite corner of the frame.\nYou can even use horizon lines to produce the same effect. Simply find a flat horizon, then tilt your camera for a tense, disorienting, dutch-angle look!\nYou don’t need slanted lines in every one of your photos. But they do enhance the composition by keeping the viewer both focused and engaged, so if you get the chance to incorporate diagonals into a shot, do it!\nThe Golden Triangle\nYou may be familiar with the golden triangle compositional overlay, which encourages you to place key elements of your composition along these gridlines:\nAs you can see, the golden triangle overlay incorporates several very clear diagonals, from the strong line down the middle to the smaller lines coming from the other corners.\nNote that you can use any part of the golden triangle overlay to place tilted lines in your compositions. There are a number of powerful approaches you can try, and you don’t always have to include elements that run the entire length of the shot.\nReally, I’d urge you to experiment with positioning diagonals in different places. You can start with a slanted line that’s positioned straight through the middle of the shot – running from corner to corner – but then try moving the line more toward the middle of the frame; you can also see what happens when you let the line start outside the frame versus inside the frame (both effects are interesting!).\nLeading lines are a popular photographic composition element, especially among landscape photographers (though plenty of other photographers also use leading lines to great effect).\nThe idea is that a line leads the viewer up from the foreground and toward a compelling background, which creates the illusion of depth while also focusing and engaging the viewer.\nNow, not all leading lines are diagonals. For instance, S-curves are a famous example of powerful leading lines, which wind their way up toward the back of the shot in a meandering fashion. And some leading lines are completely straight, taking the viewer up and back.\nBut diagonals in photography are frequently featured as leading lines, and they’re extremely compelling. For instance, check out how these trees cut through the shot in order to take the viewer toward the background:\nThat’s what diagonals can do. Don’t you feel pulled along?\nDiagonals vs the Rule of Thirds\nDiagonals run through the frame, well, diagonally. Whereas the rule of thirds states that the best compositions include key elements a third of the way into the frame.\nTake a look at the rule of thirds gridlines, and you’ll notice something interesting: There are no slanted lines!\nAnd it’s true: The rule of thirds doesn’t say anything at all about diagonals. But this isn’t because tilted lines are bad; it’s because the rule of thirds is not the only useful compositional guideline that you should follow.\nIn fact, when you combine the rule of thirds and diagonals together, you get especially compelling images. For instance, you might position your main subject at one of the rule of thirds intersection points and then include a leading line running through as a diagonal (straight toward the main subject).\nOr you could put your main subject around the top-third gridline, but then include several diagonal leading lines running up from the bottom of the frame. As long as you think carefully about your subject and line positioning, the results are bound to look good!\nDiagonals and Triangles\nI’ve talked all about diagonals and how they can help your images, but triangles are where things really come together – because triangles are diagonals arranged in a stable shape!\nAnd triangles are very stable indeed, which is what makes them so great for photography; they combine the motion of diagonals with the stability of a fully formed shape. That’s why I recommend you incorporate strong triangles into your photography whenever possible.\nNote that you don’t have to find full triangles to include in your compositions. You can also work with partial triangles or implied triangles, which can still result in beautiful compositions. So whenever you see the opportunity to work with triangles, take it!\nCreate Dynamic and Unique Compositions!\nDiagonals aren’t the most talked-about compositional element out there, but they play a key role in creating dynamic, focused images.\nThat’s why I recommend using them whenever you can. Just experiment with positioning tilted lines at different edges of the frame as well as toward the middle, and see how your images turn out!\nDiagonals in Photography FAQ\nWhat are diagonals?\nDiagonals refer to slanted lines in an image. They’re a fantastic composition element, so I recommend you use them whenever possible!\nShould you use diagonals or the rule of thirds?\nYou can use either one, though you can also use both diagonals and the rule of thirds together to create ultra-powerful shots!\nShould you use diagonals or triangles in photography?\nDiagonals are naturally a part of triangles, so the two elements go very well together. While it’s true that diagonals work well on their own, you can also create triangles out of your diagonals!\nWhy are diagonals good for photography?\nDiagonals are great for photography because they move the eye through the frame, and this movement helps the viewer engage with the photos.", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}

{"id": "736", "text": "\"We are what we repeatedly do\"- Aristotle\nPregame Prep (today's overview)\nUp, Up, Down, Down, Left, Right, Left, Right, B, A\nIf you grew up in the 80's like I did you know this was the combination for the original Nintendo to make the game easier to play. Referred to as a cheat code this made harder tasks in the game easier: granting you unlimited lives and giving you super powers. I've found a cheat code for daily success and it all starts with a regular daily routine.\nAs long as I can remember I've been an early riser, there is something very special, almost sacred in the silence and darkness before sunrise. I find clarity and my true self in silence and stillness. As everything / everyone starts waking up the senses within also awaken.\nWhen I read Hal Elrod's Miracle Mornings he put my thoughts and action into words. His key practices \"Life S.A.V.E.R.S\" are something everyone should think about incorporating into their daily routine. SAVERS stands for: Silence, Affirmations, Visualization, Exercise, Reading and Scribing. The 5am club from Robin Sharma had so much resounding information of things I was already doing as well. Robin discussed blocking out time for deep work, using time that you normally 'waste' waiting in lines, commuting, breaks, lunches learning instead of consuming mind numbing content. Learning skills and getting better really is possible.\nIf you have a daily routine of 1 hour a day 5 days a week. In 5 years you will have spent 1,300 hours on self-care and self improvement. That’s basically 162 x 8 hour work days!! I think you should have a daily routine 7 days a week, but everyone needs to design a plan that works for them.\nIf you focus on yourself for 1300 hours you are going to come out a champion before 5 years. This is how small bits of focused time work over longer periods. This is your path to freedom and happiness.\nFilm Review (my experience)\nThe past year I've found a really sweet game plan for my daily routine. I've noticed huge change in my attitude, my health, and my wealth. I'm going to share what I do, not because I think you should copy it, but maybe something inspires a thought or idea for you\nMy morning routine actually begins before I go to bed. I read my hand written affirmations before bed and I think about the next day, I set a couple intentions and my most important goal(s) for the upcoming day (write them down, keep a journal near the bed). I express gratitude for 3 things. Then I sleep.\nI don't need an alarm clock, somehow I tend to wake up between 4:45 and 5:15am no matter what time zone I'm in. I don't have specific\"work hours\" so the hour variance doesn't matter to me. It’s a running joke that my body somehow knows the local time? I don't know, I just embrace this internal clock.\nBefore getting out of bed I say thanks for another day, I run through a gratitude list. I rise with energy, I say my affirmations (always out loud) and review my goals for the day.\nI play the morning rampage from Abraham Hicks while I make my coffee.\nI spend some time in meditation. Don't over think meditation, just practice nothingness! Don't Google \"am I meditating correctly\" that means you are overthinking...\nI also really enjoy morning walks/jogs at daybreak. Watching the sun rise, looking at nature and reflecting on just how much space there is. Thinking how many molecules make up a tree. How much space there is between branches, how much space there is between mountains, valleys, the moon, the sun. We are really small, even if the ego wants us to think we're important.\nI then take a few moments to journal key thoughts, anything significant that I'm feeling thinking or ideas.\nThis takes me about an hour. Sometimes longer depending on distance I choose to walk/jog.\nI think a lot about ego and judgement in my life. I don't want either to over crowd or take control. I hope you will also start thinking about ego and judgements as your biggest opponents. We can be a huge obstacle and our fiercest opponent.\nI'd like to mention a couple things I don't particularly think about even though several books mention this… I do not think about what others do in their morning routines. I don't consider what \"failures\" do when I made up my morning routine. I don't care what a \"failure\" does. Don't give your time and energy to negatives, feed the positive! Your routine should not be designed to sound good, or contain components that you think others want to hear. Just because Hal says get up at 5am, that doesn't mean you should. Maybe you are a member of the 7am or 10am club.\nEveryone needs to make a daily routine, and I think you should make an hour for yourself every morning! If that means you have to change your schedule you should. If you don't have enough time for yourself, what kind of life are you living? And, yes, I know children and jobs make it more challenging, but we all have time its just how we use our time (tiktok, instagram, facebook, television, etc)…\nI'd like to urge you to think about what works best for you without thinking about how much better you are than people who don't have routines. Your actions your routine should not be based on negative energy or other peoples thoughts or labels… That isn't the mind of a championship coach. It's not sustainable to stay consistent when you don't believe in your process. Don't give attention to others, your success, and your progress is for you, no one else.\nOffensive Game Plan (actions to obtain freedom)\nCommit to making a daily routine. I'm not asking you to commit to a full hour a day until you are ready. But start with 15 minutes, add another 5 or 10 minutes. Find what works for you, and give yourself a chance to see results. Do not expect that things are going to suddenly shift after the first day or the first week. Its very possible they will if you keep an open minds, but your intention here is just as important as the process. Remember small chunks of time where you give full attention add up!\nI will get into greater details about the importance of each of these in upcoming posts, but for now I want you to commit creating a daily routine, and I want you to start this week with the following G.A.M.E. plan\nGratitude, Affirmation, Meditation, Education\nLets start off simple. Before you go to bed tonight I want you to write down (yes write it on paper!) 3 things you are grateful for. You can go as deep or shallow as you want with the gratitude statements, if you are having a tough week, be grateful you have arms or legs or eyes… The more meaningful the better, if you are ready to switch these up every day that is awesome!\nAlso write down at least 3 statements of affirmations that start with the words \"I am\". The I am statements should reflect the best part of you and it's fine to speak about your future vision of yourself. ( I am strong, I am wealthy, I am going to impact many lives, I am powerful, I am an amazing spouse/parent…). I will do an entire post on affirmations as I strongly believe in them to achieve freedom, purpose, and power!\nFor the next week you will read/write your gratitude statements and recite your affirmations EVERY night and EVERY morning. Bonus points if you read them out loud, also you should do this in front of a mirror for the best results.\nPractice Meditation: Try a guided meditation if you are new to meditation. Start with simple meditations focusing on breath. You can use youtube or an app like calm. If you are more advanced you can do your own meditation. The point is practice this every single day for at least 5 mins. Work up to 15-30 mins. Don't worry if you are doing it \"right\" just do it! Try to think about nothing. Set a timer and practice!\nEducation: Spend 15-20 minutes learning something important to you. Watch a video, read an article, grow your expertise! It's important to spend some time each morning improving your knowledge. We all need improvement. Every great coach/mentor I have still learns and improves daily.\nDefensive Game Plan (actions to defend your freedom)\nFind the time for yourself. We all have busy schedules, block the defense who is looking to tackle you at a moment's notice! The time you take for yourself actually helps everyone and everything around you, it seems counter intuitive at first, but starting your day with a daily routine is life changing.\nResist the urge to check text messages, social media, check stock market futures or watch the news as soon as you wake up. This was hard for me initially, and some days when I'm opening up the morning rampage the notifications are tempting. If you resist the urge to let other outside forces set your daily tone and thoughts you can not believe the power and freedom YOU can create. You set the tone for your day, no one else!\nDon't let doubt, failure or missing a day or two stop you. This is about consistency and trying new morning tactics to start off your day. Just get back in your routine when the defense tackles you. Don't fall into victim mode, just get right back into the routine.\nAudible: (unplanned changes to the plan)\nChange up your routine after a couple weeks to what works best for you. Just remember to give this all a chance and don't quit any of the key areas I described above. These are important to success, but everyone is different so it makes sense to make your routine your own.\nDo not tell yourself or me you don't have time for this. That is a personal foul with extreme consequences. You make time for things you want to do. Our yourself first and remember we all make time for things we want to do. Maybe less time on tiktok, less time watching whatever popular series is streaming right now... If you are serious about freedom and happiness don't make this excuse.\nPost-Game Review (key takeaway)\nHow you start your day is really important. While every day won't be perfect a daily routine that you design that fits your lifestyle makes success so much easier. Consistency is key! It's called a routine because it needs to become a daily habit to really see the results and feel the power!\nHey Coach!

{"id": "739", "text": "Get your copy of the 7th Annual State of Smart Manufacturing and hear from 300+ manufacturers in this new survey report!\nDeveloping a global sourcing model to serve a world-wide customer base as well as to manage global operations in a seamless way, manufacturers have adopted a ‘build anywhere-ship anywhere strategy.’ Adopting a cloud manufacturing system is emerging as the best strategy to quickly enable these capabilities.\nNo doubt global markets are enticing to manufacturers, since firms want to place manufacturing close to customers or take advantage of low-cost-country sourcing. If the goal is to service global markets, then three major objectives need to be achieved simultaneously. One is to find and achieve a cost model that reflects a fair global price point for products. The next is to achieve the global strategy, yet somehow stay close to customer markets. Lastly, manufacturers face the challenge of an expertise shortage, so finding the best talent to stay competitive can be difficult.\nFrom start-up until stability is achieved, managing the global processes continues to be a key challenge for manufacturers. Firms are seeking ways to leverage process and expertise on a global basis, yet they lack a method to establish and maintain cohesion. Software is a method for establishing and codifying business processes. But if organizations set up new plants in isolation, they lose the opportunity to establish cohesion with the rest of the enterprise.\nHaving traveled the world installing on-premise systems, several weaknesses in an on-premise-software-and- process-plants approach became apparent:\nThe additional risk is that ‘local control’ of the software implicitly means the plant either will go its own way or be starved in some way for information. Not a good strategy for controlling costs and creating that global sourcing strategy within your company or with your customers.\nIf we see software as the means with which to codify the corporate M.O., then the approach we use to implement software and how we use it to control the process is all-important. Many global companies have been implementing a global cloud single instance for the enterprise. A multi-tenant cloud approach can help address the challenges mentioned above.\nHere are some benefits, from start-up to stability, which we see:\nStage One—Bringing Plants Online. Huge losses can accrue if projects go over budget and are late. The losses don’t affect just operational costs; a resulting lack of competitiveness and/or revenue can affect the company for a long time. By using a cloud software solution, the following advantages can be attained: IT challenges associated with onsite installation and integration are reduced. Employees can get trained quickly so they can address localization adaptations and go live with less anxiety and fewer delays.\nStage Two—Establishing and Maintaining Continuity and Cohesion. Over the long term (which happens sooner than you think), companies need to think about how each plant supports the whole. How does that plant establish and maintain an integrative strategy and set of workflows with the rest of the company and trading partners? Some of the areas in which strong integration is required are:\nStage Three—Change Management. Ultimately, change happens. Change management across sites can be maddeningly frustrating, not only due to divergent approaches, but the complexity of moving to the new process in a synchronized way. A diverse IT portfolio is a major obstacle to process, product, or market changes.\nAs customers and products change, if product and process can’t quickly adapt, companies lose that global flexibility to respond to their markets. Global sourcing advantages fade and costs increase. Building in adaptability with a highly configurable cloud solution that is architecturally designed in a continuous deployment mode allows for agility and balance across global resources.

{"id": "742", "text": "Another Place Productions' current home - a modest studio in Southeast London - is its ninth since forming in 2012.\nThere are various reasons for such a quick turnaround in office space, but the principal one is growth.\nWhile by no means a juggernaut, Another Place has expanded comfortably from three co-founders to a lucky team of 13.\nWhile there, they worked under Peter Molyneux - primarily on the critically-acclaimed Fable series - and began a friendly working relationship that's spanned almost a decade.\nTexier remembers his time at Lionhead fondly, but recalls the frustrations that led to his pursuit of Another Place. Frustrations shared, as it turns out, by his fellow co-founders.\n“Because it's such a big corporation, whatever it is you do, whatever role you have, you have very little control over what the game will end up being like from creation to being in the market,” he reflects.\n“We wanted to have a project that we owned from start to finish.”\nThis was the shared sentiment that birthed Another Place Productions in 2012, but the vision for what said project should be was altogether less clear.\nWe realised mobile would be the best way for us to completely own a project from creation to publishing.Jeremie Texier\nEstablished just as PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 were reaching the end of their lives, but with Xbox One and PlayStation 4 still yet to be revealed, 2012 was something of a no man's land for a newly-established studio.\nThe original plan was to digitally distribute through Xbox Live Arcade and the PlayStation Store, and the trio's Lionhead background made sure that there was no shortage of interest from publishers and platform holders.\nThis, however, was the exactly what they had parted ways with Lionhead to avoid.\n“We realised [mobile] would be the best way for us to completely own a project from creation to publishing, so it was in December 2012 that we decided to focus completely on mobile,” says Texier.\nWith that decided, the biggest priority for the team was to get something out as quickly as possible in an attempt to get a handle on (and prove its commitment to) the vastly different landscape of free-to-play mobile development.\nWhen it came to conceptualising that all-important debut title, it was angel investor Chris Lee - a Partner at Another Place who “has been involved from pretty much day one” - who made the crucial suggestion.\nLee advised the team to take inspiration from Qi Studios' PC title Rag Doll Kung Fu, a game which allowed the player to exploit the character's ragdoll physics to create clumsy, flailing-limbs combat.\n“We thought the opportunity was great,” says Texier. “[It enabled us to] focus on all the other aspects and think, 'how can we turn this into our first free-to-play title?'”\nLearn by doing\nThis is what went on to become Dragon Finga, and it came with three major objectives from Another Place: short development time, an accomplished end product, and - most importantly - to gain experience in the market.\n“We felt we knew how to make a good game, so our expectation was that it would be well-rated and liked,” recalls Texier.\n“But, in terms of monetisation, we weren't expecting it to do very well because it was our first go.”\nIndeed, Portes adds that it was “a complete gamble” to opt for a skill-based arcade game, a genre that's “very hard to succeed with” in terms of monetisation.\nAs you'd expect of a project started by three developers with no mobile background (with a fourth joining halfway through) there were mistakes.\nFirst off, Texier reports that the team learnt “very little” from Dragon Finga's brief soft launch because it was “too short and we [already] knew what needed to be changed.”\nTrial and error\nDragon Finga was a gentle ramp-up into live operations.Guillaume Portes\nSecondly, despite “a lot of love from Apple” propelling the game (launched September 2013) to around a million downloads in the first week, the game was monetising poorly.\n“And yet people were still playing it, Texier recalls, “so from September to November we were trying to fix the monetisation side without affecting the way people were playing and the retention.”\nAfter a period of “trial and error,” Another Place launched a new build of Dragon Finga in late November 2013 - “and indeed, everything went up without affecting retention.”\nWhile not a connected game on the scale of second game BattleHand, Portes describes this experience as “a gentle ramp-up into live operations,” culminating in a costume update in January 2014 that saw Dragon Finga re-featured by Apple.\n“That was exciting stuff,” says Texier. “It validated all our changes.”\nIn many ways, Dragon Finga was Another Place attempting to prove itself.\nPortes refers to a lot of “failure in converting” among developers swapping console for mobile at the time, and a determination to prove that the studio was more than just another failed experiment.\nMcCormack adds that he, Portes, and Texier established Another Place with the belief that their background as esteemed console developers would give them some kind of head-start in mobile - an assumption he now calls “so naive.”\nThe reality, he quickly found, was quite the opposite.\n“[Console developers] are seen as people who take years to make games that cost a lot of money, which is not what people want to hear when it comes to mobile, especially VCs,” he says.\n“It was important for us to prove that we could make a game, release it, and get good reception in 6 months - and we did it.”\nTime to grow\nConsole devs are seen as taking years and lots of money to make games - not what VCs want to hear.John McCormack\nWith targets met and a line drawn under Dragon Finga as “a great learning experience,” Another Place had shown itself to be a capable mobile studio - and one that wasn't going to retreat to the comforting familiarity of console development anytime soon.\nThis attracted the interest of Initial Capital and Connect Ventures, who invested in the company in May 2014.\nInvestment afforded the studio some stability, and the capital to build a team to develop RPGs - which had been the ultimate aim from the studio's inception.\n“It works out well if you look at our passion, the team's skillset, and the market; RPG ticks all three boxes,” considers Texier.\nPlaying its cards right\nBattleHand began life, on a conceptual level, as an Eye of the Beholder-style dungeon crawler with Dragon's Lair-inspired visuals.\nOpting to avoid direct character control (“too unwieldy” on mobile) and to keep session length as short as possible without resorting to autoplay, Another Place soon arrived at the card-based combat that forms BattleHand as we know it today.\nSoft-launched in March 2015 (self-published), the firm learned from its mistakes with Dragon Finga by giving BattleHand “much longer” in soft launch.\nThis time, it proved far more useful.\n“We were capturing a slightly more casual, adventure game audience [in soft launch] than the RPG card players [we were after],” recalls Texier.\nThis was all well and good for acquiring users, but it wouldn't help BattleHand to retain them over the long term.\n“The feedback was suggesting that we needed to go either casual or hardcore,” says Portes. “Being in the middle wouldn't work for the game.”\nNow committed to going “the full monty in terms of depth,” Another Place spent May and June “rebuilding entirely.”\n“Now we had a goal, we had an audience, we knew what to do - it was very efficient.”\nOn the dotted line\nIn September 2015, BattleHand was signed up for a publishing deal by Kongregate. The two companies had been in contact since April, with Another Place reporting “really good chemistry” between them.\nWe're really happy with the engagment for a game that still has a lot of features to come.Jeremie Texier\nBattleHand was finally launched in January 2016, but still has many features yet to be added.\n“We're all happy, this is a very solid start,” enthuses Texier.\n“We're incredibly happy with the engagement for a game which is currently a single campaign, asynchronous PvP which has no competitive element, and survival mode - there's a lot more to come.”\nMcCormack may hate the term 'Games-as-a-Service', but he appears to love its implications as Another Place continues to work on its first truly live, connected F2P experience.\n“When we were making console games, we were not talking to anybody and then releasing it… it's like a closed world, you're split off a little from the people playing it,” he says.\nNow running competitions and getting suggestions direct from the community, that couldn't be more different from the reality Another Place is currently experiencing.\nHaving successfully escaped the disconnected and creatively stifling world of triple-A to make games on its own terms, Another Place has quickly gone from new kid on the block to a stable, established member of the London development scene.\n“If you spend months learning, and release a game before others, then it's turn to return the favour,” says Texier of the collaborative relationship among London's studios.\nOriginally chosen simply by virtue of its convenient links to both Guildford (where Portes and Texier are still based) and Brighton (McCormack's home), England's capital also offers a number of additional benefits.\nAs well as boasting far more mobile game studios than the “very console-based” Guildford, it's also home to both Google and Apple, and a convenient place to host potential visitors to the studio from overseas.\nThe three co-founders behind Another Place have managed to find the freedom they left Lionhead to pursue, and seem very content with the place they have carved out for themselves in mobile development.\nThe studio has made the console-mobile transition wholeheartedly, with respect and appreciation for free-to-play that shines through in its ethos and its games.\nHaving learnt much from both Dragon Finga and BattleHand, and with the latter still very much a work in progress, there's a feeling that the best is yet to come for Another Place.", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

{"id": "749", "text": "Almost two years into this pandemic, there are few who have not experienced a holistic change in their personal and professional lives. The pandemic has had an indelible impact on the nature of professional work for almost everyone. Most employees have been encouraged to work from home during the COVID period. While working from home has been a fairly straightforward transition for many employees, it has nonetheless presented challenges for managers in keeping the performance of their employees up to the mark.\nWhat is needed is for organizations to reshape the skills of their managers. This can be accomplished by training managers to shift their mindset away from traditional managing to a new management style in order to be successful. The five skills managers require to get the desired results that can assist them in this uncertain business environment are:\n- Critical thinking\n- Remote communication\n- Emotional intelligence\n- Innovation & creativity\nWe’ll explore each in further detail below.\nMost businesses worldwide are operating online; it is highly likely that this will continue even after the pandemic. It has become very important for managers to be resilient. Resilience and flexibility are about having a broad mindset when directing employees who work remotely and readjusting the working framework during the pandemic.\nCritical thinking is one of the top managerial skills required in this Covid era. In the pandemic, the use of social media has become very common. As a result, there is a lot of divergent and often contradicting data on the internet. It is certainly the need of the hour that managers should develop strong critical thinking skills to evaluate the available information in order to make the correct decisions.\nCommunication with the Team Working in a Remote Environment\nCommunication is a challenge when your team is working remotely. A good manager should establish good communication channels to get the employees’ best performance especially when they are working remotely. This includes active listening, and the right level of virtual meetings, emails, and phone calls to assist employees to understand the task better.\nEmotional intelligence is a very vital element of managerial skills nowadays. It means being aware of the emotional well-being of your team members. A manager needs to check the mental health of their employees, especially during times like these when everyone is already so tense due to the pandemic. Moreover, the manager should encourage employees when they are performing their best, keep their spirits high, and give them a break when needed.\nInnovation and Creativity\nIt wouldn’t be wrong to say that innovation and creativity are much-needed managerial skills, for the following reasons:\n- To make employees more productive, a manager needs to be creative and innovative when assigning tasks to employees. Creativity and the ability to understand each team members individual motivational “value drivers” is necessary so that employees do not lose interest in the task.\n- To make businesses successful in the challenging environment of the pandemic, over-performance is only possible when a culture of continuous innovation and creativity has been built.\nGiven that the pandemic has reshaped the world, managers can successfully steer their teams out of the current stressful environment by using new managerial skills in a fresh and super-efficient way. After all, change and innovation are the need of the hour in every aspect of life in this pandemic!", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}

{"id": "759", "text": "PVC pipe demand in water distribution, wastewater and plumbing has increased in the past few years due to the continued recovery in the construction industry, along with ongoing public and private sector investment in a decaying water distribution infrastructure. Total volume demand for PVC pipe grew nearly 12% from 2014 to 2015, led by plumbing (hot and cold water pipe and drainage, waste, vent pipe) where year-over-year growth was driven by new housing starts.\nVolume growth in plumbing was tempered by low unit pricing compared to infrastructure demand, specifically municipal water distribution and wastewater where larger diameter pipe commands premium pricing.\nThese infrastructure PVC pipe markets are not only benefitting from structural tailwinds but also from keen marketing among pipe manufacturers. PVC pipe provides a value proposition that resonates with end users and is well-aligned with such innovation drivers as pipe bursting, trenchless installation and horizontal direction drilling (HDD). Manufacturers are taking direct aim at selling the payback benefits to municipalities to owners and engineers using local reps with the experience and relationships to drive specifications. Spec in hand, pipe manufacturers sell to all distribution points since contractors buy from local distributors. The value creation is all in gaining the specification.\nDemand for PVC pipe is expected to continue its current growth trajectory as these products support broad industry trends, including a mid-cycle housing market, increasing municipal budgets for ongoing repair and upgrade of infrastructure projects and continued adoption of innovative and lower installation cost methods.", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}

Nicola Kennedy, School Business Manager said: “The move from ActivBoards to ActivPanels was extremely easy for us. ActivInspire™ software is supplied as standard with both systems, which means our teachers could still use all of the same lessons they had created previously – with the additional benefit of using the latest interactive surface for engaging students.”\nOffering a stunning, high-definition screen combined with award-winning ActivInspire software, the ActivPanel has given Cavendish teachers a powerful teaching tool to deliver interactive, multimedia lessons, which increases student engagement. “Teaching staff have praised the complete solution of the ActivPanel and ActivInspire software as invaluable. They are easy to use by both staff and students, and students are excited to learn,” explained Nicola.\nWith unique ActivGlide™ technology, the ActivPanel glass surface eliminates the risk of finger burn and enables content to be viewed with great clarity – even at wide viewing angles.\nAvailable in 55”, 65”, 70” high-definition and 84” ultra-high-definition displays, the ActivPanel interactive display facilitates collaborative learning opportunities and interactive teaching for all classroom sizes. According to Nicola, this is a real benefit: “Feedback from teachers so far is that the ActivPanels make content crystal clear on the screen. HD picture quality has made a massive difference to the experience and makes it easier for pupils to see and interact with more detailed content. The quality of the presentation is very important, and teachers have found it directly relates to students’ motivation and engagement levels.”\nSupporting a full range of learning experiences, including whole class, individual, duo, small-team and multi-team classwork, the ActivPanel allows the whole class to simultaneously share ideas, practise team-based problem solving and manipulate images.\nIn addition to ActivInspire software as standard, which has been optimised for use on the ActivPanel interface, Cavendish Community Primary can also access Promethean Planet’s 90,000+ free teaching resources and online professional development, and have been known to say they “couldn’t live without it.”\nSupplied and installed by Promethean reseller partner, Elementary Technology, Nicola continued: “Elementary Technology has been excellent at guiding us through the selection of the right collaborative solutions for our teaching environments. As promised, all the panels were delivered, installed and working in the timeframe agreed, there were no glitches and very professional service was received, as ever.”\nIan Curtis, Promethean’s Head of Western Europe, Africa & ANZ, concluded: “Creating a more collaborative approach to learning is something we are real advocates of at Promethean.

{"id": "773", "text": "In the area of oral health, traditional dentistry is evolving to allow for a more all-encompassing approach that covers more than merely treating symptoms. This blog is your resource for learning about the aspects of holistic dentistry that go beyond traditional techniques if you’ve ever wondered what to anticipate from a holistic dentist. Let’s explore the different facets that contribute to holistic dentistry’s distinctive and patient-centered methodology.\nUnderstanding Holistic Dentistry\nHolistic dentistry, also known as biocompatible or unconventional dentistry, is a philosophy that views oral health as an integral part of overall well-being. Unlike traditional dentistry, which often focuses solely on treating symptoms, holistic dental care considers the whole person. It emphasizes prevention over intervention, aiming to address the root causes of your dental issues.\nIn a holistic dental approach, the mouth is seen as a reflection of the body’s overall health. The interconnectedness of oral health with factors like nutrition, stress, and lifestyle is carefully examined. Patients can expect personalized care, incorporating natural and minimally invasive treatments, fostering a proactive attitude towards oral health.\nHolistic dentistry goes beyond the drill-and-fill mentality, prioritizing patient education, prevention, and a deeper understanding of the mind-body connection. It’s a commitment to not only preserving a vibrant smile but enhancing the overall quality of life.\nKeep reading to understand how visiting a holistic dentist can help you uncover a diverse range of dental care. Let’s discuss some of the top treatments you and your loved ones can expect from these dental practitioners.\nPrevention Dentistry: Nurturing Oral Wellness from the Root\nHolistic dentistry places a strong emphasis on preventive measures, acknowledging the profound connection between oral health and overall well-being. Unlike conventional dentistry, which often focuses on treating dental issues reactively, holistic dentists work proactively to educate patients on maintaining optimal oral health.\nFrom personalized oral hygiene routines to dietary recommendations that support dental health, prevention dentistry in a holistic setting aims to empower patients with the knowledge and tools to safeguard their smiles.\nEmergency Dental: Immediate Care with a Holistic Touch\nWhen dental emergencies strike, biocompatible dentistry offers immediate care with a unique emphasis on patient well-being. Holistic emergency dental services are designed to address urgent concerns promptly, providing relief while aligning with the principles of holistic care.\nHolistic dentists approach emergencies with a commitment to minimizing discomfort through natural remedies and techniques. From sudden toothaches to chipped teeth, these professionals prioritize both short-term relief and long-term oral health.\nUtilizing minimally invasive procedures and avoiding harmful substances, holistic emergency dental care ensures that patients receive effective treatment without compromising their overall well-being. This holistic touch extends beyond immediate solutions, aiming to identify and address the root causes of emergencies, promoting sustained oral health and harmony in the long run. In times of dental crises, holistic dentistry stands out by combining swift, effective interventions with a commitment to the holistic principles that underpin this patient-centric approach.\nChildren’s Dentistry: Nurturing Healthy Smiles from the Start\nHolistic dentistry extends its principles to cater to the unique needs of young patients. Children’s dentistry in a holistic setting is not just about treating dental issues but fostering a positive attitude towards oral health from an early age.\nEngaging and interactive sessions help children understand the importance of proper oral care, and treatments are designed to be gentle, minimally invasive, and free from harmful substances, creating a foundation for a lifetime of healthy smiles.\nMyo Therapy: Beyond Teeth – Addressing Muscular and Facial Harmony\nHolistic dentistry recognizes the intricate relationship between oral health and the overall musculoskeletal system. Myo therapy, short for myofunctional therapy, focuses on addressing imbalances in facial muscles and oral structures.\nBy promoting proper muscle function and coordination, myo therapy contributes not only to enhanced oral health but also to a harmonious facial appearance, illustrating the holistic approach’s broader impact on the body.\nLaser Dentistry: Precision and Comfort in Treatment\nHolistic dentistry embraces technological advancements like laser dentistry to provide precise and comfortable treatments. Laser procedures offer numerous benefits, including reduced pain, faster healing, and minimized trauma to surrounding tissues. From cavity treatment to gum surgeries, laser dentistry aligns with holistic principles by prioritizing patient comfort and overall well-being throughout various dental procedures.\n“Holistic dentistry is not a new concept but with an ancient past from the year 1800. In 1850, the National Dental Association recognized the harmful effects of amalgam used for restorative purposes.”\n- Vigarniya, M. M., & Rathee, M. (2018). A Literature Review on Holistic Dentistry. Journal of Oral Health & Community Dentistry, 12(3)\nHomeoblock Appliance: A Holistic Approach to Orthodontics\nHolistic dentistry even extends its principles to orthodontics with the Homeoblock appliance. Unlike traditional orthodontic methods, the Homeoblock appliance aims to not only straighten teeth but also enhance overall facial balance and harmony.\nThis innovative approach to orthodontics aligns with the holistic philosophy of treating the individual as a whole, recognizing the interconnectedness of oral health and the broader aspects of well-being.\nAppointment Types: Tailored Experiences for Individual Needs\nBiocompatible dentistry takes a personalized approach to appointments, recognizing that each patient has unique needs and concerns. Here’s a closer look at some of the specialized appointments offered by holistic dentists:\nProblem-Focused Dental Exams: Holistic dentists go beyond routine check-ups by offering problem-focused dental exams. Whether you’re experiencing specific discomfort or have a particular concern, these appointments delve deep into the root cause. Through comprehensive examinations, holistic dentists identify issues at their early stages, allowing for targeted and effective interventions.\nComplete Holistic Exam of Mouth-to-Body Link: In a holistic dental setting, the mouth is viewed as a gateway to overall health. Complete holistic exams explore the intricate connection between oral health and the well-being of the entire body. This thorough examination considers factors such as nutrition, stress, and lifestyle, providing a holistic understanding of how oral health impacts overall wellness.\nAdditional Services Requested by Patients: Holistic dentists acknowledge that patients may seek additional services beyond conventional dental care. Whether it’s exploring alternative therapies, nutritional counseling, or incorporating mindfulness techniques into dental practices, holistic dentists are open to integrating complementary services that align with patients’ preferences and contribute to their overall health.\nA visit to a holistic dentist promises more than just routine dental care. It encompasses a proactive and personalized approach to oral health, embracing a broader perspective that considers the interconnectedness of oral health with overall well-being. From prevention dentistry to emergency care, holistic dentistry offers a unique and patient-centric experience that prioritizes not only your smile but your entire health journey.", "scores": {"score": 4, "score_transform_1": 5, "score_transform_2": 5, "score_transform_3": 0}}
{"id": "774", "text": "It’s time to acknowledge an uncomfortable truth: Kris Bryant will never be the face of Colorado Rockies, despite their best efforts.\nTo be clear, Bryant is a great baseball player, and his accomplishments with the 2016 Chicago Cubs remain historic. But being the face of that franchise will always be his legacy — and he’s earned every bit of it.\nIn the story of his career, Bryant’s time as a Colorado Rockie will probably earn a paragraph in the afterword, and no seven-year, $182 million contract will change that.\nBesides, the face of an MLB team needs to be on the field more than 122 games in two seasons; he needs to hit more than 15 home runs; and he has to be visible to fans. Because of injuries, that hasn’t happened since Bryant signed with the Rockies.\nBud Black has told reporters that Bryant is a key clubhouse presence. That’s good because young teams, like the Rockies, need guidance, and Bryant brings unique experience.\nStill, being a good clubhouse guy doesn’t matter when it comes to being the face of a franchise since the job is inherently public-facing. In addition to the injuries, perhaps being that guy just isn’t who Kris Bryant is. That’s okay, too. None of this diminishes his on-field skills or accomplishments.\nLook, the Rockies haven’t had a true face of the franchise since Nolan Arenado forced his way out of Colorado.\nBut in November 2022, that changed because, it turns out, when Bill Schmidt traded Juan Brito to the Cleveland Guardians, in return, he got more than a lefty power bat with some speed.\nThe Rockies announced today that they have acquired INF/OF Nolan Jones from the Cleveland Guardians in exchange for Minor League INF Juan Brito.— Rockies Club Information (@RockiesClubInfo) November 16, 2022\nColorado currently has 39 players on the 40-man roster.\nIn Nolan Jones, he got all that plus some intangibles no one saw coming. Schmidt found the new face of the franchise.\nIt’s a job that requires more than athletic skill; it also involves personality. On both fronts, Jones has not disappointed.\nHe’s a terrific baseball player\nThe face of any sports franchise, first, needs to be an exceptional player, and Jones has established he can play. I’m not going to delve into the numbers (because Skyler Timmins will do that in “Ranking the Rockies”), but it’s worth pointing out that Jones is MLB’s first rookie to hit 20 home runs, steal 20 bases, and earn 19 outfield assists. He’s probably going to receive some Rookie of the Year votes, too.\nOur guy Nolan is the NL Player of the Week! pic.twitter.com/tJIceVQQkM— Colorado Rockies (@Rockies) October 2, 2023\nHe has personality\nThis part of his game emerged throughout the season.\nFor example, ESPN doesn’t just mic up any baseball player for Sunday Night Baseball. But when the Rockies played the San Francisco Giants, they chose to visit with Nolan Jones.\nThe broadcasters asked about his vantage from the outfield, to which Jones, honest to a fault, held up his glove to shield his eyes and confessed, “Guys, I cannot see a thing.” He had hot takes about football (“Birds are winning the Super Bowl this year”); Charlie Blackmon (“If Chuck wants it, he can have it”): his favorite Philadelphia athlete (Bryce Harper); and his family.\nHe has charisma and humor, both key characteristics for any face of a franchise.\nIt feels like he belongs to Rockies fans\nGiven that Jones came through the Guardians’ system, he’s not truly “homegrown,” but it quickly came to feel like he’d been a Rockie from the start — albeit with some gap years.\nIt helps that he’d been on the Rockies’ radar for awhile. Back in November, general manager Bill Schmidt told Patrick Saunders, “We liked him when he came out of high school and he’s a good athlete with some power.”\nMoreover, he wants to be here, though he didn’t always feel that way.\n“To be honest with you, the first day, it was horrible. It was horrible the first day,” Jones said to Rob Bradford’s “Baseball Isn’t Boring” podcast when describing his feelings about being traded. “I was devastated. I played for seven years and became best friends with all the guys I came up through the system with. I was actually on vacation and it ruined my whole day. I was really upset and then I looked at it as a new opportunity.”\nIt helped that he found a warm welcome in Arizona from Ryan McMahon, Brian Serven, and Randal Grichuk.\n“There was a bunch of guys and I remember calling my dad on the way home and I was like ‘This is going to be the best thing that ever happened to me,’” he recalled. “I got to meet a whole new group of people. It was scary for me at first, I didn’t know what to expect, but everything about it has been awesome.”\nHe’s relatable — and he can’t stop himself from being honest\nJones always seems so straightforward.\nTake this passage from an August 2023 story by Thomas Harding, back when folks were beginning to understand Jones’ talent:\n“In 2016 I was drafted by [Cleveland], and I got to watch a Rookie of the Year, KB, go win a World Series [with the Cubs],” Jones said. “I told him — I probably shouldn’t have — but I had a picture of him in my room. He was playing third base at the time. He was a superstar. I wanted to be like Kris Bryant.”\nFocus on that line when Jones confesses, “I told him — I probably shouldn’t have.” He realizes that he should probably be cool and act like it’s no big deal, being on the same team as his childhood idol. But he can’t help himself: He has to say this to Bryant, even though he risks looking foolish doing it.\nAnd then he can’t keep from telling this potentially embarrassing story to Thomas Harding and, by extension, the world.\nAll of this suggests to fans that they’ve got the real deal, not a marketing construct.\nAnd that matters when someone is the face of a franchise.\nHe has leadership\nLeadership is hard to measure, but you can see it in Jones’ interactions with his teammates.\nWhen the rookies were going to Starbucks in Chicago to get coffee for the vets, Jones led the procession. When the camera focused on the Rockies’ bench because of a big moment, he was leading the cheers for his teammates. When Elehuris Montero hit a walk-off single, Jones was the first person to get the party started. When praised for his improving outfield defense, he routinely deferred to Brenton Doyle and credited Ezequiel Tovar for being a role model.\nAnd when you saw him at batting practice, he was usually wearing a Justin Lawrence “CAUTION: WATCH FOR SWEEPERS” t-shirt. Maybe he’s just a fan of BreakingT, but he was probably supporting a teammate.\nJones has that in spades.\nHe’s had a great story since arriving in Colorado\nThink about it.\nIn addition to having a breakout rookie season (and if it weren’t for Corbin Carroll, Jones would be in the thick of the ROY discussion), KB, his childhood idol, offered him a challenge: If Nolan Jones could hit 20 homers or get 60 RBI, Bryant would give him a Rolex.\nThen Jones worked hard and met the goal.\nSeriously, you can’t script a Hallmark movie like this.\nLook for this to be Nolan Jones’ signature move going forward.\nIn a miserable 2023, Rockies fans had a glimpse of the future.\nI don’t know why Rockies fans have a thing for guys named “Nolan.” They just do.\nBe of good cheer, Rockies fans. Nolan 2.0 has arrived.\nGoodman had a wide-ranging conversation with Nolan Jones when the rookie was en route to Scottsdale for the offseason — and it’s a two part conversation. There’s much for Rockies fans to absorb here. But if nothing else, listen to Part II to get the details of not playing during the Seattle Mariners series, that Kris-Bryant-gifted Rolex, and learning to throw again in 2019.\nTrevor May is one of my favorite baseball players, in part because he does such a good job of using social media to explain baseball to fans.\nLast week during the NLDS, he took to X/Twitter to outline what goes into approaching a batter — and it’s a lot.\nHow I would prepare to face Bryce Harper tonight, a thread...— Trevor May (@IamTrevorMay) October 13, 2023\nOn a different note, yesterday, May opened up on his thoughts about selling the Oakland Athletics, and it’s perfect (WARNING: Profanity):\nTrevor, even though you’ve retired, please keep sharing your insights.\nPlease keep in mind our Purple Row Community Guidelines when you’re commenting.

{"id": "775", "text": "Numerically Aided Phenomenology: Procedures for Investigating Categories of Experience\nKeywords:phenomenology, quantification, classification, reading experience\nAbstractComplementarity between quantitative and qualitative methods often implies that qualitative methods are a step toward quantitative precision or that quantitative and qualitative methods provide mutually validating \"triangulation.\" However, there also is unacknowledged quantification within the type of analytic induction that is considered pivotal in qualitative thinking. We attempt to justify this claim and present a form of phenomenological analysis that invokes numeric algorithms. Numerically aided phenomenology is a procedure for systematically describing categories (kinds, or types) of lived experience within a set of experiential narratives. In a comparative reading, recurrent meaning expressions are identified and paraphrased. Then judgments about their presence or absence are used to create matrices representing the profiles of meanings expressed in each narrative. Finally, cluster analytic algorithms are used to group these experiential narratives according to the similarities in their profiles of meaning expressions. In this way, categories of similar experiential narratives—and their distinctive attributes—can be identified. Rather than an essentialist conception of the qualities defining classes, in numerically aided phenomenology classes are defined by more-or-less invariant attributes, i.e., classes are formed such that members share a large number of expressed meanings, although no single meaning (or set thereof) is necessary or sufficient for class membership.

The list of allowed operations for the current backends can be found here.\nFor hardware backends, the number of qubits in your algorithm must always be set equal to the number of qubits on the chip, although you do not need to perform operations on all qubits.\nWhen you do not provide any\nprep statements for your algorithm, all qubits will be initialized in the ground state or |0> state in the z-basis.\nWhen you do not put any\nmeasure statements at the end of your algorithm, by default all qubits will be measured in the z-direction. When you do close your algorithm with a measurement on one or more qubits, only those qubits will be measured and the result for non-measured qubits will be set to the default value of zero.\nIn most cases you will have to execute multiple shots in order to get some statistics on your measurement and to reduce the effects of decoherence, leakage, and control imperfections.

Make sure you select the backend which best fits the requirements of your algorithm in order to optimize overall execution time.\nWhen you execute your algorithm on an emulator backend it is usually unnecessary to execute multiple shots of the same algorithm. In this case Quantum Inspire will use simulation optimization to produce the results more quickly. This can only be done when there are no measurement instructions in your algorithm and no error model is used. Please refer to the section on simulation optimization to understand the difference between deterministic and non-deterministic algorithms, when optimization will be applied, how you can influence this decision, and what the number of shots implies for these situations.\nTo understand how simulation optimization works with the SDK, experienced users should refer to the Advanced user guide.\nSelecting the number of shots\nWhen no simulation optimization can be used the algorithm will be executed N times. When simulation optimization is used, no randomization will be applied when N=1. In all other cases randomization with N virtual shots will be applied.\nWhen a simulation is put in the queue of a backend, a copy of the current code of the algorithm is stored with the result of the execution.

{"id": "779", "text": "Before settling and starting a family, the first thing people do is check the most suitable places to raise their families in. Some of the biggest concerns before settling include security, education institutions, amenities, hospitals, and recreational centers. Basically, an affordable, decent place with everything within reach. The US is one of the most sought-after countries to raise families in, and whether you are moving from a different country or simply want to relocate to another city within the country, there are endless options you can choose from. Read on to see some of the most family-friendly cities in the USA.\nArlington is strategically located, neighboring a few of the biggest employers in the country. It has a population of about 229, 534 with schools ranking 25% higher on average than those in other parts of the country. And if you want your kids to get their higher education from there, there are four universities you could choose from. The median home price is $729,477 and it is one of the safest cities to be in, with a crime rate lower than the national average by a whopping 61%. Apart from the usual outdoor activities, there are tourist activities you could take part in: It is even pet-friendly with five city-owned dog parks! So it’s an ideal place for the whole family!\nIn the northwest corner of Broward County is where you find Parkland which is populated by about 32,000 people. When it comes to education, there are 5 public schools where your kids can get a quality education. And depending on the neighborhood you wish to move to, there are a few things to consider. For instance, would you choose neighborhoods with very close proximity to amenities, somewhere you can simply walk to? Also, is close proximity to shopping areas and restaurants that important to you. Or yet, would you prefer quiet to busy areas with bursting energy? In Parkland, you will find endless opportunities, and talking about safety, the crime rate is quite low.\n“Most families we work with all ask about Parkland, and those that can afford it, end up living there. It’s really got family appeal and the fact that most families view it as a destination, will only work to serve that appeal” says Mack Dudayev, founder of Chance Realty.\nWith a median home price of $390,914 and a population of 146,431, Naperville has been considered one of the best cities in not only Illinois but the whole of the country to live in. Indian Prairie High School in Naperville was ranked by Chicago Tribune as the best in the US in 2015 and in addition, there were other well-ranked schools on the list. Its neighborhoods are safe and there is a variety of family-friendly activities to enjoy in the city. What’s more, the population in Naperville is quite diversified with a bigger percentage of locals well-educated.\nColumbia is a perfect family-friendly location situated in the Baltimore-Washington metro area. It is a planned community with schools ranking high within the state and the whole of the country, as well as a number of libraries in the city. Regardless of the village you choose to live in, there are recreational centers in all of them with fitness centers and swimming pools. Also, there are kids’ playgrounds lakes, and hike trails, so outdoor fun is not limited. Back in 2018, Columbia was crowned the title ‘the safest city in America’ and with a median home price of $363,388, it is definitely a family-friendly city.\nThe Woodlands, TX\nThe Woodlands is made up of different planned neighborhoods in the suburban parts of Houston, TX. From great schools to grocery stores, golf courses, and office parks, the city is such a pleasant location to raise a family in. On top of that, there are both public and private schools, with 18 elementary schools and a community college. The city has a population of 109,608 and a median home price of $351,000. There are also family activities you can indulge in, some of which help promote a sense of community for the locals. Crime rates are also low, so most of the neighborhoods here are safe.\nBellevue is not only a family-friendly city but one with an illustrious job market recognized country-wide. It is neighbored by headquarters to some of the biggest companies and has been named the sixth position in the list of the healthiest cities in America. These are some of the reasons why a lot of young professionals and families are drawn to settling in Bellevue. It has a population of $139,014 and a median home price of $729,381. While it has been known to have low crime rates, its police have been ranked among the top when compared to other cities in the state. Parks here have different amenities, and there are more indoor and outdoor activities for every family member.\nBowling Green, OH\nWhen it comes to family fun, you’d want to think about parks, lively events, and camps, just to mention a few. Bowling Green is loaded with such facilities and more. The best part is that the cost of living is very affordable, with the median listing price being $160,000. So even if you want a large family, it would not be as hard to attain the financial stability you want and provide for them. If you and your spouse would like to enjoy the nightlife in Bowling Green, there are no limitations, from restaurants to bars, cafes, and nightlife spots. If you prefer daytime outdoor activities for the whole of the family, there is kayaking, fishing, yoga, hiking, and cycling that you can enjoy in different spots around the city.\nThe location you choose to raise a family in is as important as the home. Choosing a location without information about it such as security, affordability, schools, social amenities, hospitals, recreational facilities, the infrastructure, and everything in between could cost you more than you think in the long run. What is your income and what costs will you incur in that city? Will you need to rearrange your budget in order to afford your new home and support your family? Generally, will there be drastic changes and how well will your loved ones take to settle in the new location. There is just so much that goes into it, but with a good plan and prior research to the move, you should have little to no stress.", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}

{"id": "791", "text": "In the wake of last Saturday’s enormous Palestine solidarity march, Conor Reddy assesses the growth of movement, the challenges it faces and the strategies we need to bring about full Palestinian liberation.\nSaturday’s march for Palestine in Dublin was enormous. Perhaps the biggest seen since the peak of the water charges movement almost a decade ago. Between 70 to 100,000 people took to the streets demanding action to stop the genocide in Gaza and to hold the Zionist state to account for its crimes. The march marks a high point for a movement that has been mobilising consistently at local and national levels since Israel’s offensive began after October 7th and demonstrates the depth of Irish solidarity with Palestine in spite of Irish Government inaction, British and EU complicity and the conservatism of sections of the broad left at times.\nIt is entirely appropriate that such large numbers demonstrated when they did. Atrocities continue unabated in Gaza as the effects of destruction so far visited upon the Strip amplify horror and tragedy. At this point, Occupation forces have dropped over 65,000 tonnes of bombs on Gaza killing over 24,000 people (including 10,000 children) and maiming tens of thousands more. 33% of all buildings in the strip have been destroyed. Entire residential neighbourhoods have been levelled. Critical infrastructure including hospitals, sanitation facilities and schools have been demolished. And now, the spectre of famine haunts those who remain as the Occupation tightly controls the passage of aid into Gaza, using hunger as a weapon of war. According to the U.N. one in four people are now starving and nine out of ten families in some areas go a day and night without eating. Over 60,000 people are wounded and Gaza’s medical system has been almost completely destroyed. Only a third of Gaza’s hospitals are in any way functional. Only six ambulances are still functioning – for a population of over 2.4 million. At this stage of Israel’s genocidal campaign, hunger and disease could very well claim more lives than bombs, bullets or shells if it is allowed to continue.\nFacing this dark vista, South Africa acted as the conscience of the world, launching their Genocide Convention case against the Zionist state at the International Court of Justice in the week before Saturday’s protests. Irish lawyer, Blinne Ní Ghrálaigh, who is part of the prosecution, was celebrated internationally and seen locally as more representative than any figure in the Irish Government. Leo Varadkar’s remarks on the case were particularly shameful. Refusing to offer state support for the prosecution, he drew equivalence between Israel’s genocide and the events of October 7th before questioning the appropriateness of levelling charges of genocide against Israel given the Jewish experience of genocide in the Holocaust.\nMore subdued but equally shameful was Mícheál Martin’s suggestion that those calling for Ireland to join the case were trying to “create division”. For his part, Transport Minister and Green Party leader, Eamon Ryan, said there were “irrefutable” points in the genocide case, but refused to be drawn on the question of Irish support because, “The court case is one standing effectively first between South Africa and Israel”. If you’ve been wondering what it might take for the Green Party to take down the Government, don’t hold your breath now.\nDespite government opposition to joining the ICJ case, the first days of hearings spurred on the movement and will now become a key focus here in Ireland and around the world. This was evident on Saturday in speeches and chanting but it must go much further.\nShifting the Terrain\nWhile Saturday marked a high point for the movement, it is far from the only success we have had to date. In the weeks after October 7th, Varadkar and Martin were both vocal in condemnation of Palestinian resistance and staunch in their support of “Israel’s right to self defence”. Martin, in particular, was ridiculed when he travelled to Occupied Palestine in November, posing in a house supposedly hit by a “Hamas Rocket” while the local regime gave him a guided tour. Since these early days, Varadkar, Martin and the Government have been forced rhetorically to the left, abandoning their earlier defence of Israel and making comments that have drawn ire in the Zionist state, to the point that the Irish ambassador was summoned for a dressing down by Israeli officials in December. Now, they are under serious pressure as they cling to their line that they support a ceasefire – while doing nothing to bring it about. All of this is happening in the context of a serious push by the Government to do away with Irish neutrality and row in behind NATO. But now we are a far cry away from the stage-managed consultative forums the Government ran last June – the credibility of the US-led NATO and EU PESCO forces has been obliterated by US, British and EU support for Zionism.\nA harder won victory for the movement came when Sinn Féin was forced into changing its position on the expulsion of the Israeli Ambassador (for a second time, back to its historically held support for expulsion). Sinn Féin’s initial refusal to support expulsion (and full-throated condemnations of Hamas) was met with confusion, shock and then anger. Large sections of Sinn Féin’s base could not accept such a sharp turn from a position that the party had strongly endorsed just two years prior, in 2021. Pressure mounted on local reps ahead of important votes on support for expulsion on councils in Belfast, Derry and elsewhere but the party forced abstentions, meaning the narrow defeat of a Pro-Palestine motion in Belfast. Arguments raged online and in SF strongholds in response to these votes, with SF public reps and the well-known Felons’ Club jumping into the fray on opposite sides of the argument. Days later, Sinn Féin correctly made a U-turn with a statement calling the position of the Ambassador to the South “untenable”. Mary Lou McDonald asserted that this decision had nothing to do with a fear of being outflanked, but this is hard to believe, given that she had been arguing the opposite position with people online only the day before her statement.\nThe victory for the movement highlights the need for concrete political demands that can be put on the Government to shame them into taking action. The result of Sinn Féin’s initial fence-sitting was that the Government had six weeks at the beginning of the war on Gaza where they had cover to hide behind nebulous calls of ceasefire without action.\nToday, as the whole world, with the notable exception of Israel, the United States and its vassals support the call for a ceasefire. The question is, how do we achieve one? Who will bring it about? In this context, calls for the expulsion of the Israeli Ambassador (particularly in “the West”) and for sanctions on Israel must be at the forefront of our demands. Likewise, we must keep the pressure on Ireland to support South Africa’s case at the ICJ.\nWhite House Visit\nThe St Patrick’s Day visit to the White House is emerging as another key pressure point for the movement in Ireland. Biden’s paddy-whackery and self-professed “Irishness”, combined with his militant support for Israel and denial of atrocities make the visit an important target for protest. Without his political assent and billions in financial support, Israel’s campaign would have ended long ago. Varadkar, Martin and the forelock-tugging gombeens of the Irish establishment see their “special relationship” with the US as sacrosanct, critical to their economic model which is reliant on “investment” from US companies and funds. This in part explains their desire for Ireland to draw closer to NATO and US leadership. In these circumstances, where the US President is a direct accomplice to genocide, however, they are politically vulnerable and there is an opening to attack, by demanding they boycott the visit.\nA boycott would be a propaganda coup over US imperialism, much more than a gesture or a moral victory. Snubbing Biden in an election year and the US in general would reverberate globally, further undermining American imperialism and potentially inspiring others to take aim at Israel’s most loyal patron. In addition to $3.8 billion of military aid the US gives to Israel annually, Biden bypassed congress to provide another $14.5 billion in military aid in November. Since he was first elected, Biden has been among the most rabid supporters of Zionism in American politics. Now he risks a catastrophic regional war, having authorised military strikes on Yemen without congressional approval after the Yemeni blockade on Red Sea shipping to and from the Zionist entity.\nFor peace and justice to reign in Palestine and across the Middle East, Biden must be tackled as hard as Netanyahu and the Zionists – he too should stand before the Hague. Anyone who shakes hands with him in the White House on St Patrick’s Day will struggle to wipe the blood from their own hands afterwards. Saturday’s march made their feelings on this very clear, with chants of “No shamrocks for Genocide Joe”. Bernadette McAliskey got a huge response from the crowd when she said:\n“Weigh up the corpses of Gaza and a jolly to the US. Nobody here should give a single vote to anyone whose backside is in Washington.”\nWe have two months to pile the pressure on Leo Varadkar and the Irish Government not to go to the White House. Once again, Sinn Féin also need to be pressured on this – the last we heard from Mary Lou McDonald on this was that she was not in favour of a St Patrick’s Day boycott. We’ve shamed her into doing the right thing once – we can do it again as a movement.\nAs well as pushing for a White House boycott, the use of Shannon Airport by the US military must be hauled back onto the agenda. Particularly now as the US increases its aggression in the Middle East with air strikes on Yemen and the threat of further aggression in the wider region, the Irish state is once again complicit in the war crimes of US imperialism.\nBuilding a Movement for Palestinian Liberation\nWhile the immediate task here and around the globe is to build forces sufficient to stop the slaughter of Gaza, a larger task now looms. The question of “the day after” and what follows such a shocking series of crimes is growing in importance and the numbers of people asking deeper questions about the oppression of Palestinians has grown exponentially. The Palestinian struggle has reached a turning point, one it has been approaching for years, driven forward by the dialectic between the arrival of End Stage Zionism (the total elimination of Palestine and Palestinian national ambitions) and the changing dynamics of Palestinian resistance that led to October 7th. Nothing in Palestine can ever be the same, there is no returning to the pre-October 7th reality and there is no hope that the West could impose a “two-state” scenario that would be supported or sustained for any length of time. In this moment our task becomes to sustain the movement for an end to genocide but also to deepen its politics and channel its energy in support of Palestinian liberation.\nHow do we do this? Mass mobilisation has been and will continue to be hugely important, in forcing demands on government, but also in consolidating the enthusiastic support of tens of thousands of Irish people. Socialists must continue to push for large scale national and regional marches, and to work with others in this task. Mass platforms, as Bernadette McAliskey showed last Saturday, open the way to mass support for radical demands.\nDirect action has also helped to keep the momentum up over the past few months, particularly across the few (strictly relative) lulls we have seen since October. This must continue. Action for Palestine Ireland, Saoirse don Phalaistín and Dublin for Gaza have all at various times sustained the movement and sharpened its focus. Occupations at the Zionist Embassy, blockades of bridges, a dinner at the US Ambassador’s residence and dynamic BDS-themed moving protests have focused minds across the broader movement on important political and economic targets.\nThis has also allowed for a concentration of militants, where politics is discussed, developed and deepened. To date, direct actions have not veered towards small-group clandestine action, which in other instances has proven counterproductive, intensifying state repression on activists and shifting focus away from mass participation.\nAnother important tactic has been the boycott. Many people are boycotting key Israeli-linked businesses on an individual level, which has some effect, but the most effective strategy is to build a collective campaign in the community to pressurise local shops and businesses from stocking Israeli goods in the first place. There have been a number of successful examples of this kind of campaigning. For example, in Derry activists mobilised on a grassroots level and were successful in pressuring O’Neill’s into removing Puma products from their stores and in forcing the local branch of Home Bargains to remove Israeli goods they stocked. Going back to 2014, Kinvara in Galway was the first place in Ireland to become completely free of Israeli goods. This can be done elsewhere by petitioning local people and then campaigning against any shops that stock Israeli goods. Local solidarity groups and political activists should band together and make this a focus of their activity outside of demonstrating and mobilising together for marches.\nAs local campaigns grow, pressure should also be brought to bear on councils to end contracts with companies on the Global BDS list, especially HP, who have contracts for printers and computer equipment with local authorities North and South. In the run up to Local Elections in the South, Left candidates should commit to making their wards “Apartheid Free Zones” and to advancing positive solidarity initiatives, twinning with Palestinian towns and villages, flying the Palestinian flag, engaging in cultural and economic exchanges.\nOutside of protest, boycotts and direct action, one of the most striking elements of this movement has been its cultural wing. While in other Western countries, many artists and musicians have either shamelessly backed Israel or remained silent, there has been a wave of support from those in Ireland. Thousands attended the Gig for Gaza at the 3 Arena back in November, after the gig was moved from Vicar Street due to popular demand. Countless other solidarity gigs have taken place across the island.\nAll of this is overwhelmingly positive, but there are a few things to say about it. Firstly, we should approach these events as acts of solidarity and not charity. There has been, in any case, a basic problem with fundraising since the beginning – very little aid is being allowed into Gaza. What is primarily required, therefore, is not a charitable solution, but a political one. There was outrage, for example, at Green Party TD Patrick Costello when he put on a fundraiser to raise money for Medical Aid to Palestine, after voting against expelling the Israeli Ambassador and sanctions on Israel.\nNevertheless, these fundraisers can also be used to educate people and to inspire them to take other actions to build the movement. On the other end of the spectrum from Costello, That Social Centre in Phibsborough ran a series solidarity nights for Palestine where, as well as music and poetry, there were political speakers who could help deepen people’s understanding of what is happening, lay out a strategy, and explain to people what else they can do to build the movement.\nArt can move peoples’ hearts and minds, but ultimately if we are to change things, we must act on that inspiration in the form of concrete political action.\nSadly, there is one key area where we have been sorely lacking – the trade unions and our workplaces. Despite overwhelming solidarity across the population and an Irish Congress of Trade Unions mandate to stand in solidarity with Palestinians and the BDS Campaign, we have seen precious little from trade union leaders. SIPTU dropped a banner on Liberty Hall calling for “Ceasefire Now”. They were lauded in some quarters for doing this, but this is less than the bare minimum. The call for a ceasefire is in lockstep with the Government – what are they going to do to make it happen? Ireland has a proud history of trade union action to draw on when it comes to tackling Apartheid – the Dunnes Stores workers who refused to handle South African goods and created a tidal wave of support for the anti-Apartheid movement, for example. Crucially, they were supported by their union in doing so.\nUnfortunately, we cannot expect much from trade union leadership in this regard. Therefore, the fight must be built from the ground up by rank-and-file members in their branches. We urgently need another Mary Manning moment, where workers refuse to handle Israeli goods. If and when this happens, the pressure must be put on trade union leadership to back their workers regardless of the legality of political strikes under the repressive, 1990 Industrial Relations Act. The emergence of workplace campaigns like Teachers for Palestine and the flying of union flags by activists on Saturday are a start. The movement now needs people to dedicate themselves to drawing together groups of workers across sectors to build general solidarity in their workplaces and to fight for a more active stance of solidarity as we approach union conference season.\nIreland can be a leader in the West\nIntensifying activity locally, in our workplaces and in the cultural sphere will root the Palestine solidarity movement more deeply, creating a vehicle capable of taking on the longer and more substantial task of supporting liberation whilst maximising pressure for an end to genocide in the short term. In this task the movement must remain connected politically, led by a united front and the voices of Palestinians in Ireland. There must be space for education and politics as well as activism. Socialists have an important role to play in this regard and should continue to host meetings and educational forums to equip greater numbers with the clarity and confidence to lead the movement on its various fronts. Campaign groups like the Irish Palestine Solidarity Campaign will be the glue that holds the movement together and should begin to expand to include workers, students and to coordinate with those taking part locally or in direct action.\nSaturday 13th January was a high point but it must not be the highest point. With huge numbers actively standing in solidarity with Palestine now, there is every opportunity to make Ireland truly exceptional and to give a lead to others across the West. Winning a victory against the Irish establishment on behalf of Palestine and against imperialism would be a light to a universal struggle, here and around the world. Offering hope to Palestinians and indeed everyone else.", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

Produced and written by multi-Platinum entertainer Dierks Bentley along with co-writers Jim Beavers and Brett Beavers, the live track was recently recorded in Nashville and delivers a powerful message through lead singer Doug Douglason’s prolific lyrical musings. THE K IS SILENT is now available for pre-order here at all digital retailers and fans will instantly receive the new patriotic track.The music video for “The USA Begins With Us” is simultaneously available now, meshing together “a tongue-on-cheek rave-up of every patriotic cliché in the book” (CMT) with a message more timely than ever.

{"id": "798", "text": "Press Status: Not Free\nPress Freedom Score: (0 = best, 100 = worst) 69\nLegal Environment: (0 = best, 30 = worst) 23\nPolitical Environment: (0 = best, 40 = worst) 30\nEconomic Environment: (0 = best, 30 = worst) 16\nPress freedom conditions deteriorated in 2013, placing Iraq among the most deadly countries for the media, with at least 10 journalists killed in connection with their work during the year. Reporters also suffered frequent detentions, beatings, and confiscation of equipment, as well as poor legal protections in terms of both upholding their rights and obtaining justice for violence perpetrated against them.\nIraq's constitution protects freedom of speech and expression, but vague and often overlapping laws govern the media. The 1968 Publications Law allows journalists to be imprisoned for up to seven years for insulting the government, and the 1969 Penal Code criminalizes libel and defamation. At year's end, at least 10 journalists faced criminal charges for defamation under Article 314 of the penal code, which provides penalties of up to one month in prison or a fine of up to $215. In 2010, the Supreme Judicial Council created a special court to prosecute journalists, despite a ban on the creation of special courts in Article 95 of the constitution. In October 2013, the Court for Media and Publications sentenced a journalist to three days in prison for writing an article that accused government housing authorities of corruption. The 2011 Journalist Protection Law initially offered some hope of reform by safeguarding free speech, providing benefits to journalists who are killed or injured on the job, and abolishing the requirement that they belong to the journalists' union. While the law represented a positive step, media watchdog groups complained that it was ambiguous and narrowly defined who constituted a journalist; it also did not override sections of the penal code or the publications law that pertain to journalists. The Society for Defending Press Freedom in Iraq challenged the law, but the Federal Supreme Court upheld its constitutionality in 2012.\nIn January 2013, the controversial Information Technology Crimes Bill was withdrawn from consideration by the parliament. The draft law would have included harsh punishments such as life imprisonment for using computers to adversely affect the \"unity\" of the country or its economic, political, military, or security interests. A second draft bill called the Law on Freedom of Expression, Assembly, and Peaceful Protest would, among other prohibitions, ban press statements \"inconsistent with public order or morals,\" but this bill had not been passed at year's end.\nIn the semiautonomous region of Kurdistan, the Kurdistan Press Law protects the right of journalists to obtain information \"of importance to citizens\" and \"relevant to the public interest.\" The law also requires officials to investigate incidents in which journalists are injured or killed as a result of their work. However, few journalists' deaths have been investigated. Public officials regularly use the region's penal code to sue journalists for libel, usually for stories about corruption. According to the local advocacy group the Metro Center to Defend Journalists, hundreds of court cases are filed against journalists each year, charging them with, among other things, defamation or vaguely defined offenses such as insulting religion. In October 2013, the newspaper Awene and its former editor in chief, Shwan Mohammed, were both fined after the paper published a photograph in 2009 of a politician at a nightclub in London.\nIraq has no national law guaranteeing access to government information, and in practice official information is difficult for journalists to obtain. The Kurdish regional government enacted a Right of Information Law in June 2013 that, although positive, left room for improvement regarding procedures for information requests and appeals.\nThe primary body responsible for regulating broadcast media, the Communications and Media Commission (CMC), is seen to be under government control. In April 2013, the CMC suspended the licenses of 10 television channels, including Qatar-based Al-Jazeera, for \"unprofessional coverage\" amid accusations that their reporting was inciting sectarian violence. Most of the suspended stations were locally based and had ties to Sunni politicians. The suspensions were lifted in June, but the stations continued to be harassed by authorities throughout the year. In July, the CMC demanded exorbitant new licensing fees from some independent radio stations to allow them to continue broadcasting. In September, Al-Baghdadiya television had its office raided and transmitting equipment confiscated by officials, reportedly after the station aired a news segment that was critical of the Interior Ministry.\nReporters are regularly prevented from covering sensitive stories or denied access to officials and news events. In addition, self-censorship among journalists remains widespread due to fear of reprisals in the form of deadly violence or criminal libel suits.\nJournalists face regular threats and physical harassment from both state and nonstate actors, and Iraq had one of the world's highest murder rates for journalists in 2013. The northern town of Mosul was an especially dangerous city for members of the press: In October, gunmen killed Al-Sharqiya cameraman Mohammed Ghanem and correspondent Mohammed al-Badrani while they were filming Eid al-Adha holiday preparations; also that month, gunmen shot and killed Bashar al-Nuaimi, a cameraman for Mosuliya TV. In November, two more journalists, Alaa Edwar and Bashar Najm, were shot dead in separate incidents in the city, and in December, unknown assailants gunned down journalists Nawras al-Nuaimi and Adel Muhsin Hussein in a pair of attacks. In other cities, radio journalist Muwaffak al-Ani was killed in a Baghdad explosion in May; the body of Zamil Ghanam al-Zoba'ie, a veteran journalist who worked for several outlets, was found in Baghdad in June; gunmen killed Wadah al-Hamdani, a television reporter in Basra, in November; and Muhanad Mohammed, a journalist for Sumariya TV, was killed in a suicide bombing in Baghdad in December. Also in December, at least five journalists were killed when suicide bombers stormed the headquarters of the Salah al-Din television station in Tikrit, north of Baghdad.\nOther types of violence against journalists continued throughout the year. The Arab Network for Human Rights Information logged dozens of incidents in which men allegedly affiliated with the security forces assaulted and detained journalists from various media outlets. In April 2013, an armed group attacked the offices of four separate newspapers, destroying equipment and assaulting employees. In May, the brother of an Iraqi reporter for Agence France-Presse was briefly kidnapped and reportedly warned by his abductors to tell his brother to stop covering corruption in Anbar province. In another incident, an Algerian photographer working for a the French publication Le Monde Diplomatique was detained for 23 days after photographing a location that authorities said was restricted. He was later accused of failing to register as a journalist as required by the Journalist Protection Law.\nIn Kurdistan, physical attacks during 2013 included the murder of Kawa Germyani, a prominent Kurdish magazine editor investigating government corruption, who was shot dead in Sulaymaniyah in December. In February, a bomb exploded over the offices of an independent news channel, Nalia Radio and Television, a day after it aired criticism of Mustafa Barzani, former leader of the Kurdistan Democratic Party.\nThe identities and motives of the assailants have remained unclear in most cases. In the December attack on the Salah al-Din television station, the Interior Ministry confirmed that security camera footage identified the killers, but no arrests were reported. In Kurdistan, security forces arrested seven people and issued an arrest warrant for an eighth following Germyani's murder; six of the suspects were later released, and a trial was still pending at year's end. The lack of prosecution in most cases has resulted in a climate of impunity.\nHundreds of privately owned television, radio, and print media outlets have opened since the regime of Saddam Hussein was overthrown in 2003, producing content in Arabic, Kurdish, Syriac, Turkmen, and other languages. However, political parties and ethnic groups fund most media outlets, and journalists often cover political events from the point of view of a particular group, blurring the distinction between news and commentary. The government controls the Iraqi Media Network, a holding company that owns Al-Iraqiya television, Republic of Iraq Radio, and the newspaper Al-Sabah. Satellite dishes are legal, and as many as 97 percent of homes in Iraq have a dish. More than 30 satellite networks transmit into Iraq, including Al-Sharqiya, an Iraqi-owned station that broadcasts from Dubai; Qatar-based Al-Jazeera; and the Saudi-owned Al-Arabiya.\nAdvertising revenues alone are too small to sustain Iraq's private media, and advertising with no editorial demands attached makes up only a small fraction of a typical outlet's revenue. The government shapes the editorial content of some outlets by manipulating public advertising or pressuring private advertisers. Journalists have also reportedly slanted the news in return for bribes from officials, who offer money, land, and other rewards.\nThe internet operates without government restriction, and usage has steadily increased since 2003. A growing number of Iraqis turn to digital and social media to spread information and consume news. However, poor infrastructure and sporadic access to electricity have made Iraq's penetration rate for terrestrial internet access one of the lowest in the region. Instead, the majority of Iraqis who use the internet access it through wireless technology. The internet penetration rate stood at only 9.2 percent in 2013\nDisclaimer: © Freedom House, Inc. · All Rights Reserved\nThis is not a UNHCR publication.

How waste is handled and practices followed are changing throughout the construction and demolition industry, and it is important to stay in the loop and make sure that you are compliant.\nAs experts in the field, here at REMONDIS we are keeping on top of the changes and have, therefore, put together the following article of information on the new regulations and what they mean for you and your business.\nShould you feel as though you need a little more expert advice, be sure to get in touch with the team here at REMONDIS who’ll be able to guide you and answer any questions you may have.\nWhat’s Changing In The Regulations of Recycling Wood Waste?\nOn 1st September 2023, the Environmental Agency (EA) confirmed the withdrawal of the Regulatory Position Statement (RPS) 250 effective immediately. This decision to change the classification of ten different waste wood items follows five years of testing by the Wood Recyclers’ Association (WRA) to determine the hazardous waste contents of different waste wood products. This mainly affects ‘amber’ waste wood items, derived from construction and demolition (C&D), however, it may impact other industries.\nThis means that certain waste wood categories that previously would be sent to wood recyclers will now be classed as hazardous waste unless proven otherwise through analysis. Therefore, this hazardous wood waste will need to be disposed of at a permitted facility.\nWhat Does Your Company Need To Do?\nHazardous and potentially hazardous waste wood from pre-2007 structures, or waste classed as Grade D wood waste, must be segregated and marked as hazardous waste. This waste includes:\nHazardous Wood (Grade D)\n- Telegraph Poles,\n- CCA Treated Wood / Creosote Treated Wood,\n- Railway Sleepers,\n- Waste Wood from Hydraulic,\n- Engineering I.e. Docks,\n- Wood from Boats or Ships,\n- Tailor Beds.\nPotentially Hazardous Wood List (Pre-2007 Structures)\n- Tiling, Cladding & Battens\n- Barge Boards, Fascias & Soffits\n- External Joinery,\n- Timber Frames & Joists,\n- External Doors,\n- Roof Timbers.\nThere are four grades of wood, also, that are classified as hazardous, non-hazardous or potentially hazardous:\n- Grade A – the cleanest type of wood that is not hazardous. This includes the likes of pallets, packaging crates and offcuts.\n- Grade B and C – may contain potentially hazardous wood, therefore requiring testing before disposal. This includes furniture, wooden fittings and chipboard.\n- Grade D – hazardous waste, including wood types found in fencing, railway sleepers and cooling towers.\nAny hazardous waste must not be sent to wood recyclers unless it is sent to be tested beforehand to demonstrate that it is not a risk.\nWhat Do These Regulation Changes Mean For Your Company?\nIf your company produces any of the above wood waste items from pre-2007 structures, they must now be treated as hazardous waste. You mustn’t dispose of these items with the rest of your waste wood.\nInstead, you must book a separate hazardous waste collection or arrange suitable testing. If your items are proven to not contain hazardous elements, then they can be recycled with the rest of your wood as normal.\nThe wood must be recycled with a confirmation of the test and the results.\nWill Household Wood Waste Be Affected By These Regulation Changes?\nHousehold wood waste follows the regulations of RPS 249. This will cover when a Household Waste Recycling Centre (HWRC) accepts domestic hazardous wood waste and stores it with non-hazardous wood waste. However, this is due to be withdrawn by 1 April 2024.\nHousehold wood waste is constantly tested and the WRA is currently working to sample and test various domestic waste wood types. They currently have the expectations that hazardous contents are on the decline.\nShould you have domestic wood waste to dispose of, it is recommended that you check in with your local HWRC for their guidelines.\nArrange Your Waste Wood Collection and Disposal\nAs a result of these changes to the waste wood regulations, most recyclers will change their regulations in the coming months to exclude these hazardous waste wood types. Unfortunately, many wood recycling facilities don’t have the provisions to accept and dispose of hazardous waste.\nIf you are looking for a specialist in waste disposal to remove waste wood, make sure to get in touch with REMONDIS. Our experts can advise you on the type of wood you are dealing with and whether it may be hazardous, to conclude the best solution for disposal.

{"id": "807", "text": "Speaking at Retail Destination Live, held earlier this summer at the Jury’s Inn hotel at Hinckley Island, Dr Amna Khan, senior lecturer in consumer behaviour at Manchester Metropolitan University, discussed the ‘omnichannel seamless experience’ where consumers do not see channels, they shop, and they crave experiences that are convenient and seamless “We’re getting a hybridisation of online and offline,” she told the audience.\nDr Khan said stores had introduced technology to change the customer’s journey and create an omni channel experience. Retailer Zara has an app that has an in-store mode, where shoppers can continue to use the app in the bricks-and-mortar store to reserve fitting rooms, locate stock on the exact shelf or rail and use scan-and-go technology. She said consumers want to get in and out of a store with the same speed and efficiency as they get online.\nShe spoke about Click and Collect and also contactless collection and said this was where technology really comes into play. “Zara is actually using self-service collection – they have storage for 1,500 parcels within their store. So, what does that mean about the future for retailers? Are they going to be like fulfilment centres where they’re Amazon in the back office and offer an experience in the front office?”\nDr Khan went on to talk about returns. She said that online shopping during the pandemic had made consumers very confident about just ordering multiple items for choice and sending back what they didn’t want. But returns were hurting retailers so they were working on modifying customer behaviour by introducing a charge. She cited Zara again, where returns cost £1.95 which is taken off the refunded amount, but you can return the item free in-store. And getting those shoppers in the store was important as 70% of those collecting or returning parcels make impulse in-store purchases\nShe also talked about conscious consumption and how the consumer thought much more about their buying habits. “During the pandemic, consumers had time to think, reconsider and reflect on their consumption behaviour,” she said, mentioning the growth of sites such as the Too Good To Go food waste management system and asking whether a similar model could be used for other perishable goods.\nThis was first published in Retail Destination Fortnightly.

{"id": "808", "text": "for Panasonic 3DO\nRoad Rash is a 1991 racing video game originally developed and published by Electronic Arts for the Sega Genesis. It was subsequently ported to a variety of contemporary systems by differing companies. The game is based on a series of road races throughout California that the player must win to advance to higher-difficulty races, while using a combination of fisticuffs and blunt weaponry to hinder the other racers. It is the debut installment in the Road Rash game series.\nRoad Rash was the first title to be developed by Electronic Arts following the company's decision to begin developing games internally. The game was influenced by designer Randy Breen's enthusiasm for motorcycles, the technical advantages granted by motorcycles as opposed to cars, and the violent behavior of Grand Prix motorcyclists during races. The 32-bit versions of the game feature 25 minutes of live-action full-motion video footage and a soundtrack primarily consisting of licensed grunge music courtesy of A&M Records. The effort to license the music of Soundgarden for the title led to the inclusion of other alt-rock bands such as Monster Magnet and Swervedriver.\nRoad Rash was released to critical and commercial success. The original version for the Sega Genesis was particularly acclaimed for its violent and aggressive gameplay and the convincing sense of speed in its graphics, while the 3DO version was commended for its advanced visuals and grunge-based soundtrack. Reception of other versions ranged from positive to middling, with the later versions being considered dated by the time of their release. The game was followed by a series of sequels made for various consoles.\nPayment & Security\nYour payment information is processed securely.

A “Shaq attack” by the legendary Shaquille “Shaq” O’Neal became a coined term during his career because he unofficially damaged 12.5 basketball rims, shattered backboards, and even brought down entire stanchions with his overpowering strength and size; during his playing days, O’Neal clocked in at 7’1”, 375 pounds. In 2020, one professional player dunked the ball so hard he bent the entire rim. Even more recently on February 4, 2023 play was delayed for 43 minutes during a game due to a crooked rim.\nSince the NCAA college basketball tournament is in full swing, basketball has been on our minds. As such, we decided to use Altair simulation tools to push a basketball hoop model to its limits to see how much force a backboard can withstand before it breaks (keeping in mind current design regulations). Not only that, but how does a player’s direction, angle, weight, and force contribute to shattering a backboard? Or is there a completely different variable that causes this to happen?", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}

Currently I'm doing about 2.\" Without further ado, my suggestions:\n- Set a goal for each post and write to achieve that goal. What's the takeaway you want your readers to get after finishing your article? Start with the point of your article -- even if it ends up being the last sentence -- and continue building from that foundation. This strategy helps focus your thoughts and cut down on your self-editing.\n- Gamify your work periods. I swear by artificially constricting work periods and using strong incentives to reward efficient behavior. Level up your writing periods by setting a challenging goal -- an old favorite of mine is \"two articles before my second cup of coffee\" -- and an attractive reward for achieving it. This method alone has doubled, maybe even tripled, my productivity. (Here are some other ideas on how to leverage Parkinson's Law if you're feeling especially ambitious.)\n- Recognize your strengths and weaknesses. I rock at writing in the morning and late at night, so that's when I do the bulk of my blogging. Conversely, I have trouble thinking analytically in the middle of the day, so I use that time to exercise, run errands or catch up on my reading. Try tracking your energy levels during a workday and take note of when you're feeling especially creative and prone to efficient writing. Then dedicate those blocks of time to blogging.\nComplement these strategies by adapting some of these habits of high-performance writers to really crank things up.", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

The Foundations of AI, Big Data and Data Science Landscape for Professionals in Healthcare, Business, and Government (978-0-367-35968-3, 325690)\nProfessionals are challenged each day by a changing landscape of technology and terminology. In recent history, especially in the last 25 years, there has been an explosion of terms and methods that automate and improve decision-making and operations. One term, \"analytics,\" is an overarching description of a compilation of methodologies. But AI (artificial intelligence), statistics, decision science, and optimization, which have been around for decades, have resurged. Also, things like business intelligence, online analytical processing (OLAP) and many, many more have been born or reborn. How is someone to make sense of all this methodology and terminology?\nThis book, the first in a series of three, provides a look at the foundations of artificial intelligence and analytics and why readers need an unbiased understanding of the subject. The authors include the basics such as algorithms, mental concepts, models, and paradigms in addition to the benefits of machine learning. The book also includes a chapter on data and the various forms of data. The authors wrap up this book with a look at the next frontiers such as applications and designing your environment for success, which segue into the topics of the next two books in the series.\nForeword Number One.

Highly recommended.\"\nJosh Wills, Former Director of Data Engineering, Slack\n\"It’s All Analytics! deserves a prominent place on executives’ bookshelves. Burk and Miner have undertaken a noteworthy challenge in their synthesis of data science, machine learning, data mining, artificial intelligence and statistics, presented at a level both useful and provocative to business leaders. The chapter on statistics particularly fills a gap in current discourse about the latest fashions in AI and Machine Learning.\"\nLoren Williams, Former Chief Data Scientist, Big Four\n\"Almost every company in the world now understands the critical importance of collecting, processing, analyzing, and acting upon data. The largest hurdles impeding companies in this process aren't caused by technical limitations or a lack of trained specialists, but by the people who need to understand how it affects them, what can be done, and how to implement and manage it within their organization, but don't.

The company's approach was multifaceted, focusing on interactive experiences, collaborations, and educational insights, all aimed at enriching the art education dialogue. One of the most notable contributions of Roux Arts was a series of workshops and seminars that they hosted during the conference. These sessions were crafted to not only educate but also inspire the educators in attendance. The workshops covered a range of topics, from innovative art techniques to integrating technology in art education, reflecting the company's forward-thinking approach to art and teaching.\nThese workshops, led by a team of experienced artists and educators from Roux Arts, were more than just instructional sessions. They were immersive experiences that encouraged participants to explore new ideas and techniques. For instance, one workshop focused on the integration of digital mediums with traditional painting techniques, a concept that resonates with the contemporary shift in the art world. This session was particularly well-received, as it provided educators with practical insights into how they could incorporate such modern approaches into their curriculums, thereby making their teaching more relevant and engaging in the digital age.\nAnother significant aspect of Roux Arts' participation was the emphasis on collaboration and community building. Recognizing the importance of networking in the art education field, Roux Arts facilitated several meet-and-greet events, allowing educators to connect with each other and with professionals from the art world. These networking sessions were not just about building contacts; they were about creating a community of educators who could share resources, experiences, and inspiration. The company's role in fostering these connections underscored its commitment to building a supportive and collaborative art education community.\nThe Roux Arts exhibition booth at the conference was a hub of activity and interest. Here, the company showcased an array of artworks from both established and emerging artists. This exhibition was carefully curated to demonstrate the diversity and dynamism of contemporary art. It featured a range of styles and mediums, from classical oil paintings to experimental digital art, reflecting the eclectic nature of modern art. For many educators, this exhibition was an eye-opener, presenting them with a tangible sense of the current trends and directions in the art world. It also served as a source of inspiration, offering ideas and themes that they could take back to their classrooms and students.\nIn addition to showcasing art, the Roux Arts booth also served as a platform for dialogue and exchange. The company's representatives, including artists and art educators, were present to engage with the attendees, answer their questions, and discuss various aspects of art and teaching. These conversations often delved into the challenges faced by art educators today, such as integrating new technologies in the classroom, dealing with budget constraints, and keeping art education relevant in an increasingly STEM-focused educational environment. Through these discussions, Roux Arts not only gained valuable insights into the needs and concerns of art educators but also established itself as a company that listens and responds to the community it serves.\nRoux Arts' involvement in the NAEA conference extended beyond workshops, networking, and exhibitions. The company also played a role in some of the panel discussions and keynote speeches. These sessions, featuring prominent figures in the art and education sectors, addressed a range of topics, from policy and funding for arts education to the evolving role of art in society. Representatives from Roux Arts contributed to these discussions, sharing their perspectives and insights, drawn from their extensive experience in the art world. Their participation in these high-level discussions demonstrated the company's depth of knowledge and its commitment to contributing to the broader conversation about art education.\nAnother highlight of Roux Arts' participation was its focus on student engagement and development. The company sponsored a student art competition in conjunction with the conference, inviting young artists from various schools to submit their works. This competition was not just about recognizing talent; it was about encouraging young artists to pursue their passion for art. The entries were displayed at the conference, providing these young artists with a platform to showcase their work to a wider audience. For many students, this was a unique opportunity to receive feedback from professional artists and educators, an experience that could be pivotal in their artistic journeys.\nRoux Arts' presence at the NAEA conference was also an opportunity for the company to showcase its latest initiatives and projects. Among these was an innovative art education program that the company had recently launched, aimed at bringing art education to underserved communities. This program, which involved partnering with schools and community centers, was designed to provide access to quality art education for children who might not otherwise have the opportunity. By highlighting this and other similar initiatives, Roux Arts demonstrated its commitment to making art accessible to all, reinforcing the idea that art education should be a universal right, not a privilege.\nIn conclusion, Roux Arts' participation in the National Art Education Association conference was a multifaceted endeavor that showcased the company's dedication to art education. Through workshops, exhibitions, discussions, and community-building activities, Roux Arts not only contributed to the enrichment of art education but also reinforced its position as a leader in the contemporary art world. The company's involvement in the conference was a clear indication of its commitment to nurturing the next generation of artists and educators, a commitment that is sure to have a lasting impact on the field of art education.", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}

My partner Arve Gravdal has produced adult salmon in Scotland. I have seen it myself.”\nTerje Mikalsen (78), a multimillionaire entrepreneur and investor is joining forces with Niri founder, Arve Gravdal, for a new land-based salmom farming site. Together they have hired Fearnley Securities to help look for EUR 4.1 million investment funding for the project.\n4.1 million investment\nNew shareholders will receive about one third of the shares in the new company EFC Scotland, and the rest will be owned by Mikalsen and Gravdal as reported in Dagens Næringsliv.\nEFC has recently taken over a small farm in Campbeltown, Scotland, and plans to build a land based facility on Lista, south Norway. This is also where Mikalsen is from.\nPlants must produce their own feed\nAccording to Mikalsen, the new land-based fish farm will capture carbon dioxide produced by salmon, and will use it to produce bacteria converted into proteins. He says that this will cover about half of the fish’s protein needs.\n“This has not been done before with CO2 from farmed fish. The process will create high-grade clean feed and reduce the use of imported soybean meal. We will integrate farming with an electrolysis plant where water is cleaved to oxygen and hydrogen. Large amounts of oxygen are required for the fish, and the rest of the oxygen together with the hydrogen and the captured CO2 must be used to make protein via bacteria. This is known technology. The electrolysis also emits large amounts of heat that can be used to dry the protein, and regulate the temperature in the farming tanks,” said Mikalsen.\nNobody has done this before\nPressed if he is sure that this method will work, Mikalsen answered:\n“I am prepared for the aquaculture industry to say that this will not work because nobody has done this before. But that’s not right. My partner Arve Gravdal has produced adult fish in Scotland. I have seen it myself,” said Mikalsen.\nArne Gravdal, leads the RAS technology provider Niri, which, under its subsidary, Niri Scotland, established a pilot plant to create 40,000 tonnes of salmon in 2015. The site at the Machrihanish Airbase near Campbelltown in Scotland, was at its time, the world’s largest tank for salmon production. However in In February 2018, the company’s shareholders decided to offer the facility for sale.\nIn September, Niri reported a loss of EUR 2.6 million since it started in 2006.

It is probably the most adventurous adventure I have been on, but I really believe in this.

{"id": "835", "text": "Comparing Roofing Materials: A Guide for Homeowners\nChoosing the right roof is like picking a hat for your home; it’s protective gear and a fashion statement. Comparing different types of roofing materials can be overwhelming, but we’ve got you covered. Each option has unique strengths, from the classic charm of wood shingles to the sturdy defiance of slate against high winds.\nWe’ll walk through popular choices like asphalt shingle roofs, known for their cost-effectiveness and ease of installation; metal roofs that offer durability with an eco-friendly twist; and more. You’ll discover how clay tiles boost curb appeal while giving fire nothing to burn and why investing in slate might mean not worrying about your roof again in this lifetime.\nDive into details on costs per square foot and weigh up longevity versus maintenance needs—key considerations before making that significant investment.\nTable Of Contents:\nAsphalt Shingle Roofing: An Affordable Choice for Homeowners\nAsphalt shingles might hit the sweet spot between affordability and reliability if you’re weighing your roofing options. It’s no wonder almost 90% of homes in the US cap off their sanctuaries with this popular choice.\nArchitectural vs. Three-Tab Asphalt Shingles\nWhen it comes to asphalt shingle roofing, homeowners are often torn between architectural and three-tab varieties. The former boasts a multi-dimensional texture and superior weather resistance that laughs in the face of heavy rain or snowfall. At the same time, three-tab shingles offer an economical solution but may shy away from strong winds.\nThe sturdiness of architectural shingles means they can be your roof’s armor for up to 30 years, which is quite impressive when considering their cost-effectiveness. On the flip side, if budget constraints have you cornered, choosing three-tab asphalt shingles could save upfront costs, though they might need more attention as time goes by.\nThe Sustainability of Asphalt Shingles\nBeyond protecting your home from nature’s whimsy, composite asphalt shingles are also friends of Mother Earth—once retired from rooftop duty, these versatile materials embark on second careers paving our roads. Yes, indeed, sustainability takes center stage here since these protective barriers over our heads aren’t destined for landfills—they’re recyclable.\nThis eco-friendly twist gives new life to what was once mere protection against sun exposure and water damage—a win-win for those keen on green living without compromising quality or curb appeal. So next time you ponder replacing that old hat your house wears so proudly atop its head – remember how affordable yet resilient asphalt singles roofing is – a truly dependable cover story.\nWhen weighing your options for a new roof, metal roofing stands out as a blend of toughness and elegance. With an impressive lifespan up to 80 years, these roofs are like the seasoned warriors of the housing world—sturdy enough to withstand Mother Nature’s tantrums yet stylish enough to turn heads.\nThe cost may have you raising an eyebrow since it ranges from $6 to $14 per square foot. But let me tell you, investing in a metal roof is like choosing a luxury car; it’s about both performance and looks. And with various styles available, from sleek standing seam designs to classic metal shingles, there’s something for every aesthetic preference.\nStanding Seam and Sheet Options\nIf modern construction had a muse, it would be standing seam metal roofing. This type isn’t just durable; its interlocking panels provide a contemporary look and superior protection against leaks. Then there’s sheet metal—a knight in shining armor against weather challenges—with large panels installed quickly for those who value time and resilience.\nYou might choose asphalt shingles or clay tiles when looking at popular roofing materials but think twice if style paired with longevity is what you seek. While others admire their traditional homes lined with wood shakes or slate tiles under sunny skies in Southern California or any region prone to sun exposure—you could stand out with chic seams glinting elegantly off your abode.\nBut here comes the kicker: not only does this material reduce noise better than some wild party tricks silence crowds—it also offers fire resistance strong enough to make dragons jealous. So why settle? Let Christian Roofing experts guide your choice towards these high-performance heroes that marry durability and design so seamlessly.\nWood Roofing Aesthetics and Considerations\nIf you’re charmed by the natural beauty of wood roofs, cedar shake roofing might be your style. Picture this: each cedar shake adds its unique texture to a roof that whispers tales of rustic elegance. But hold on—before you fall head over heels for these wooden wonders, let’s talk shop about what they bring to the table.\nCedar shakes offer a feast for the eyes but can leave you hungry for more regarding maintenance. Sitting pretty at $5 to $7 per square foot, they don’t come cheap—and neither does their upkeep. While wood roofing steals hearts with its looks, it also has a knack for attracting uninvited guests, like mold and mildew, if not properly cared for.\nChristian Roofing experts suggest regular love and attention to keep your wood roof from turning into a science experiment or crumbling under water damage woes. Think of it as pampering your roof so that it stays strong against those pesky elements looking to crash your curb appeal party. And hey, if ever things go south and decay tries sneaking in? Christian Roofing is ready with solutions faster than you can say ‘shingle repair.’ So yeah, choosing wood means committing to keeping an eye out—but trust me; with proper care, those shingles will have neighbors green with envy.\nClay Tile Roofs’ Longevity and Appeal\nIf you’re looking for a roof that combines good looks with staying power, clay tiles are hard to beat. Known for their low maintenance needs and serious curb appeal, these tiles aren’t just easy on the eyes—they’re packed with practical benefits too.\nThink of them like the seasoned actor who never seems to age—clay tile roofs can last 50 to 100 years. Now, while they might cost more upfront—typically between $10 to $18 per square foot—their durability means you won’t be shelling out cash for a new roof every decade or so. That’s some solid long-term savings.\nBeyond longevity, clay tiles are fire-resistant roofing materials that can take the heat without sweat. So, if you live in an area prone to sunny days and high temps, these terracotta warriors offer peace of mind alongside their classic aesthetic.\nLow-Maintenance Clay Tiles\nYou know how some things demand constant attention? Well, low-maintenance clay tiles don’t play that game. They’re like that friend who’s effortlessly cool without trying too hard—you get all the perks minus any needy upkeep drama.\nSure, there may be cheaper options at first glance—but when it comes down to sheer value over time? These sturdy beauties will likely save your wallet in the long run because they stand up against wear and tear like champs.\nFire-Resistant Roofing Material\nIn Southern California, where wildfires can quickly turn life upside down in no time, having a fire-resistant roofing material, such as clay tile is not just smart—it could be lifesaving.

With expert advice tailored just right for your place under the sun (or clouds), going with something as reliable yet stylish as clay tile becomes almost…well…elementary.\nSlate Roofing’s Timeless Elegance\nImagine a roof that could tell tales of the ages. Slate roofing isn’t just about covering your home; it’s about crowning it with history and class. Its natural variation in color brings life to roofs, making each one unique.\nA slate roof is often seen as a statement piece for high-end homes. But its beauty goes beyond skin deep. It boasts an impressive longevity, with some lasting up to two centuries. When you choose premium slate options for your Southern California residence, you’re not just investing in curb appeal; you’re securing peace of mind knowing this material withstands fire like a knight in shining armor.\nThe costs may range from $9 to $20 per square foot, but think of it as buying time—lots and lots of time. While others might replace their roofs every few decades, yours will stand tall through generations. If you are considering such an investment, Christian Roofing experts can help guide you toward the best choice for your needs while ensuring optimal performance.\nThe Eco-Friendly Choices in Green & Solar Roofing\nWhen you think about a roof, it’s more than just a hat for your house; it’s the frontline defender against Mother Nature. But what if that shield could also be your own power plant or an oasis for urban wildlife? That’s where green roofing and solar shingles come into play.\nGreen Roofing Benefits: Insulation Meets Urban Retreat\nImagine turning your rooftop into a lush garden. Green roofs aren’t just pretty; they pack a punch when it comes to insulation. They can keep buildings cooler in summer and warmer in winter, slashing energy bills like Zorro with his sword. Plus, they have this knack for lasting up to half a century with proper care—talk about getting bang for your buck.\nThese living roofs absorb rainwater like sponges, reducing runoff and helping prevent water damage—one of homeowners’ peskiest nightmares. And hey, bees love them. You’d be creating mini habitats up there while improving air quality around you—a win-win situation.\nSolar Shingle Energy Production: Your Personal Power Station\nGone are the days when bulky solar panels cramp your home’s style; modern solar shingles blend right in with traditional roofing materials but work double time by harnessing sunlight to produce clean energy—and who doesn’t love lower electricity costs?

These sun-loving wonders convert rays into electric savings, which means they pay themselves off over time while reducing fossil fuel use—it’s smart money moves meets eco-consciousness.\nIf sustainable roof solutions rev up your engine—or wind turbine—you have some solid options here that benefit both wallet and planet alike.\nThe Practicality of Rolled & Membrane Roofing Systems\nWhen it comes to budget-friendly flat roof solutions, homeowners and businesses often turn to rolled roofing or durable membrane systems. Both options have carved a niche in the market by offering easy-install roofs that keep the bank intact.\nDurable Membrane Systems: A Cut Above in Longevity\nDurable membrane systems, particularly popular on commercial buildings, stand out with their resilience. These roofing contenders provide a reliable barrier against weather elements and are known for easy maintenance post-installation. But here’s something you might not know—membrane roofs, thanks to their seamless coverage, can be your ally if you’re fighting water damage.\nChristian Roofing experts point out that while upfront costs may be higher than some alternatives, the investment pays off with impressive longevity; some membranes last as long as 35 years. So, if durability tops your list of must-haves, this could be your winner.\nBudget-Friendly Rolled Roofs: The Smart Pick for Tight Wallets?\nIf your pockets aren’t deep but you still need a solid cover overhead, consider rolled roofing—a no-frills solution ideal for less visible structures like sheds or workshops. Sure, they may not boast the lifespan of other materials (hovering around ten years), but installation is straightforward enough that even DIY enthusiasts look forward to rolling up their sleeves.\nThese laid-back players offer immediate shelter from sun exposure without demanding much from your budget—the cost-effective dream team working hand-in-hand with Christian Roofing professionals who can help ensure every square foot is installed correctly.\nThe Unique Advantages of Concrete & Synthetic Composite Shingles\nWhen it comes to distinctive modern roof materials, homeowners often need clarification on classic appeal and the innovative features that different products offer. Let’s unpack this by focusing on concrete tiles and synthetic composite shingles.\nSynthetic Composite Shingle Features\nSynthetic composite shingles bring a game-changing approach to roofing with their lightweight design, making them easier for your roofer to handle and install. But don’t let their lightness fool you; these tough contenders stand up well against sun exposure and water damage. They can mimic high-end materials like slate or wood shakes without requiring specialized labor—meaning more money stays in your pocket.\nBesides being cost-effective, they also have green benefits since many brands use recycled materials.

They can take on various looks—from clay tiles’ rustic charm to sleek slate roofs—all while boasting an impressive long lifespan that gives other roofing options a run for their money. The fact that color fades less over time with concrete is just icing on the cake when you think about curb appeal years later.\nConcrete isn’t shy about weight—it demands strong structural support from your home but pays off by holding its own against wind damage better than lighter materials could dream of doing so.\nIn Southern California, where Christian Roofing reigns supreme as a roofing contractor, picking either option means you’re getting top-notch installation expertise alongside a robust material suited for hot climates or wet climates alike.

Plus, solar shingles offer energy production perks so compelling they’ll knock both socks off—not just one. These sustainable solutions marry function with eco-friendliness seamlessly.\nAffordability Meets Innovation: Synthetic Options\nIf cost-effectiveness tops your list but innovation makes your heart beat faster, synthetic composite shingles could be right for you.

{"id": "841", "text": "On Saturday, Scotland will look to replicate the Calcutta Cup win over England last year as they host their bitter rivals at Murrayfield.\nIt was a historic victory in February 2021, as Gregor Townsend's men ended a 38-year wait for a win at the home of English rugby in Twickenham.\nThis time the Scots have home advantage on their side, but as the stats show, that doesn't always equal the most success.\nThere is no doubt, however, that Murrayfield will be packed to the rafters as Scotland kick off their Six Nations campaign, before travelling to face Wales, hosting France and then playing back-to-back away games in Italy and Ireland.\nTo mark the start of the historic event, Liverugbytickets.co.uk utilised historic Six Nations try statistics from the past two decades to discover which stadium Scotland can call their 'luckiest ground'.\nExpress Sport took a look at the findings, and the top five 'luckiest stadiums' for the Scots are explored below:\n5 - Principality Stadium (Cardiff)\nThe Principality stadium stands at an impressive capacity of over 74,500, and is home to various different sports throughout the year.\nIn just over a week's time, Scotland will make the journey to Cardiff to face Wales in their second Six Nations game, and while they haven't found a stunning level of success, it is still an important game.\nScotland have averaged 1.3 tries per match on average against the Dragons, making it the fifth luckiest on this list.\nIf things go their way, the Scottish national football team may also be travelling to Cardiff next month for a blockbuster World Cup play-off final at the same ground.\n4 - Stade de France (Paris)\nScotland’s fourth ‘luckiest’ stadium to play in the Stade de France which has an impressive capacity of 81,338.\nThe Scots over the course of two decades have averaged 1.36 tries per game in Paris.\nIn March last year, Wales secured their second Six Nations title as Scotland narrowly beat France 23-27, denying the French their first championship in 11 years.\nThe 2023 Rugby World Cup, including the final, is also planned for the venue.\n3 - Murrayfield (Edinburgh)\nThe home of Scottish rugby probably should be higher up this list, but this Scottish side seem to give it their all no matter where they play.\nThe 67,000 seater stadium situated in the centre of the nation's capital is a sight to behold for fans of the oval ball, and it is thanks to such an amazing atmosphere that Scotland often find good fortune when playing there.\nStats wise, the Scots have scored 86 tries in 55 games at Murrayfield in Edinburgh, which is an average of 1.56 tries per match.\nIn comparison, the English average 1.45 tries per game, so there is not much to separate the sides, in what could be a close encounter.\nRival boss Eddie Jones stoked the flame of competition this week by saying that the crowd in the hallowed stadium make Scotland 'red-hot favourites' to win the cup, but Scotland coach Townsend snapped right back.\nHe said: “Every coach does this little song and dance going into a game trying to convince the media they are underdogs and telling the players their backs are against the wall, ‘we’re going to this hostile place.'\n\"The bookies pick the favourites and I know we’re not the favourites with them.\n“It’s not really something we talk about or worry about. The reason we’re being spoken about like that is because our players have driven the standards in training and have gone through experiences – not always pleasant – that have made them better and brought them closer together as a group.\n“We have our own expectations, which is to deliver performances that we’re capable of. In last year’s Six Nations, three games stood out for us where we were close to our best: England, Italy and France. The aim for us is to try to do that in five games.”\n2 - Twickenham (London)\nScotland will take part in the 143rd Calcutta Cup on Saturday against England at Murrayfield, but have enjoyed much success in the reverse games in London.\nTherefore, taking the runner-up spot is England’s home ground, Twickenham.\nFor those who aren't aficionados of the oval ball, there could be some confusion over Twickenham as a cricket ground, but the two are entirely separate.\nIn total, Scotland have scored 19 tries in 11 matches at the home of their fierce rivals, with a n average of 1.73 tries per game.\nIn comparison, England have scored 201 tries in 55 matches at Twickenham, averaging 3.65 tries per game.\nIt was also, of course, last year that Scotland ended a 38-year wait for a win on the ground, in thrilling 11-6 victory in their Six Nations opener.\nThat game was in front of no fans due to covid restrictions, but a capacity crowd of over 82,000 can squeeze inside the stadium.\nIt also acts as a concert venue, hosting the likes of Rhianna, Beyonce and Metallica in the past, but it is usually Scotland who are rocking when they come to town.\n1 - Stadio Olimpico (Rome)\nWhile some might say Murrayfield not taking the number one spot is a surprise, Scotland fans might be disappointed that Twickenham, home of their rivals, is not top.\nScotland's most successful Six Nations stadium is actually the Stadio Olimpico in Rome.\nScotland have been victorious in four out of the five games they have played against The Azzurri in their new home, scoring an overage of 2.4 tries per game.\nThe Olimpico has only been the home of Italian rugby since 2012, as their previous games were played at the Stadio Flaminio, but due to a rise in popularity of the sport, the decision was made to move to a larger stadium.\nThe famous ground is also home to football team S.S Lazio, and has a stunning capacity of 72,698.\nNever miss the latest top sport headlines from the Scottish Daily Express.

PfH Scotland is also offering a range of bid support and advice for SMEs with limited or no experience of tendering for public sector work.\nTo further support participation be smaller local contractors, evaluation of tenders will also be 70% weighted in favour of quality and 30% on price.\nIn each geographic region, the framework has been broken down into 13 individual lots covering services ranging from energy performance certification to domestic and commercial gas servicing and from the installation of renewables to architectural services. Those tendering can submit responses for any or all of these individual lots and will then be required to identify the geographic areas within each lot that they can service.\nContractors have until July 17 to register an interest in the framework and to submit their bid. Alongside competitive pricing, technical competence and a strong track record in health and safety, those applying will be assessed according to their ability to demonstrate high quality service, market expertise, transparency and integrity alongside innovation and the use of new technologies. Contractors able to demonstrate a commitment to sustainability and social value and a capacity to deliver local community benefit will be marked particularly high.\nCommenting on the launch of the new framework, PfH Scotland head of operations, Stephen Herriot, said: “We are very pleased to be able to announce the launch of a new £600 million procurement framework dedicated to delivering heating measures designed to help social landlords across Scotland make ongoing progress towards improving the energy efficiency of their housing stock.\n“Based on feedback from our members and provisions set out under the 2014 Procurement Reform (Scotland) Act, we have sought to design this new framework in a way that actively encourages participation from smaller local contractors. This includes selecting contractors to serve six individual regions across Scotland and placing a much greater emphasis in the assessment of bids on quality, service and local community benefit – rather than focusing predominantly on price.”\nStephen Herriot added: “I would encourage heating contractors of all sizes, including those who may have no previous experience of tendering for public sector contracts, to submit applications to take part in this new framework. It is an important opportunity to secure new work while helping drive ongoing improvements in the energy efficiency of social housing across Scotland.”\nFurther information about the PfH Scotland EESSH heating services framework is available on the Public Contracts Scotland website.", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

I remember it being a big deal, both with school administration, teachers, and classmates. I remember parents not being pleased.\nNow, as an adult, I know it’s a big deal – and I know exactly how displeased parents can get.\nFast forward, and all these years later, I’m a Pittsburgh criminal defense attorney who has represented numerous students in high school and college who needed a little help navigating the academic sanctions process.\nMy firm has represented students facing academic suspension, expulsion, and other serious ramifications. And I want to make sure – especially at this time of year, when the culmination of 12 or 13 years of academic work is in the balance – that parents know that if their son or daughter gets in trouble in the waning days of his or her high school career, they are not only entitled to be represented by a Pittsburgh criminal defense attorney, but it’s also highly recommended.\nIt’s not just high school kids who face academic sanctions. Colleges also have them, and with the days getting longer, those students are also letting loose. The disciplinary procedures in institutes of higher learning can often be even more harsh than high school ones. Student athletes have more on the line, for example, if they are hoping to go pro after graduation. Students who are on scholarships could potentially lose their funding, ending their academic career.\nStudents might find themselves facing not just academic sanctions but criminal charges, as well. Often, universities will academically discipline a student for criminal charges they received, even if the crime did not happen on campus or at a school-sponsored event. Between the two, a student’s future beyond college is in jeopardy. Some employers don’t want workers with criminal records. And, some professions, like teaching, disallow people who have committed certain crimes.\nIf your son or daughter is facing academic discipline procedures, please know that they can be confusing, and the ramifications severe and far-reaching. Just like you wouldn’t go into a criminal court hearing without a Pittsburgh criminal defense attorney, it might be most wise to solicit the services of an attorney adept in working in the world of academia – and its various disciplinary boards and procedures.\nAt Logue Law Group, we handle enough of these types of cases that we even contract with a local lawyer who has also long served as a school director and who has in-depth knowledge and understanding of the ins and outs of student discipline matters.\nSo, if your son or daughter gets into a jam, don’t freak out. Give me a call and let me or one of my associates help. Don’t wait to call. The longer you wait to hire legal representation, the more difficult it will be to obtain a good outcome for your child’s case, an outcome that will allow him or her to walk at commencement with friends and classmates.\nFree ConsultationYou will never find us short of knowledge & commitment\nwhile handling your case.", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}

Some prefer to take their shower in the morning to wake up well while others do not derogate from the evening shower to get rid of the bacteria of the day and to relax after long hours of work which are felt in all their muscles. If you are part of this second camp who takes a shower more at night, it is very likely that you do your shampoo at the same time, that is to say, a little before going to bed. And besides, those who wash in the morning sometimes also make an exception on shampooing day to save time the next day when they wake up. So you've probably washed your hair at least once in the evening before going to bed.\nRest assured, if washing your hair in the evening rather than in the morning isn't a bad idea in and of itself (because it's not the timing of the shampoo that's wrong after all), you might just go for it. slip into the sheets with your hair still damp from the wash. A bad reflex that could harm your hair health on multiple levels.\nYou have certainly noticed it after going to bed with wet hair, in the morning it has generally taken bad folds during the night and sometimes displays a few frankly unsightly spikes. Blame it on the movement of your hair while drying in the open air overnight, with your head pressed against the pillow. And that's not to mention the lengths, which are also often more tangled ... Suffice to say that in the morning, the hair is almost indomitable and not really at its peak. Finally, the time saved by not drying your hair the night before is quickly lost when you wake up when you have to try to correct the situation with brushing or styling products. And this is far from the worst consequence of this habit.\nYou may not know it, but when your hair is wet, the scales that make up the hair's cuticle (its outer, protective layer) are loosened and lifted, making the hair more brittle. So porous, the hair fiber is also more sensitive to external aggressions (temperature variations, friction against the pillow, etc.) and therefore more prone to knots, which consequently also makes it more prone to breakage. It’s better not to keep your lengths wet or worse: soaked, before going to bed.\nIf you may appreciate the cool effect of wet hair on the pillow, know that sleeping with your hair still soaked after shampooing will generate humid heat which is very conducive to the development of yeast infections and fungi. on your scalp. In fact, when you sleep with your head resting against the pillow, this moisture present in the hair and on the scalp will simply macerate against a sheet which is itself a nest of bacteria. This disrupts the balance of the scalp by making it more sensitive to irritation, more prone to dandruff and itching, but also to fungi.\nSo many good reasons to stop going to bed with wet hair!", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}
{"id": "848", "text": "In this blog I look at what a flashover is, why flashovers are damaging to the overhead catenary system, why finding them is vital to run a reliable railway and how we can find them faster and more accurately using new detection techniques.\nElectrified railways are more reliable than their fossil fuelled counterparts. However, when a fault occurs with the overhead catenary / overhead line equipment (OHLE), or in 3rd rail electrification, serious disruption and delays occur as rollingstock is stranded until the necessary repairs, inspection and re-energisation of the affected section are complete.\nDewirement of overhead catenary is one of the most serious types of incident from both safety, and traffic disruption viewpoints. Dewirement is where the overhead contact wire falls, or is pulled, down onto the train/track beneath. A dewirement above or in front of a train travelling at speed can lead to several kilometres of overhead catenary being damaged due to the long stopping distances of the train and the length of the tensioned catenary sections.\nRepairs can take many hours or in some cases even days to complete.\nSource: Trenvista - The independent magazine of the railway sector\nWhat is an electrical flashover?\nAn electrical flashover is a high energy electrical discharge that occurs when an energized conductor comes into contact or close enough to another conductor to generate a spark. If this spark contains enough power to generate a plasma a flashover occurs. Plasma is a state of matter that is ionized, meaning that it has lost some or all its electrons. When a flashover occurs, the high-voltage discharge ionizes the air, creating a plasma. Plasma is a very good conductor of electricity and carries electrical current from the energized conductor typically to ground or another conductor.\nWhy is a flashover damaging to the catenary?\nThe plasma created by a flashover is extremely hot, reaching temperatures of several thousand degrees Celsius. This intense heat can cause damage to equipment, ignite fires and cause burns to nearby people. Where the flashover contacts components the intense heat can melt and cause material to be removed, weakening it, and causing failure.\nRailway OHLE power supply systems have fault detection systems to cut the power when such issues occur, however they cannot act instantly so some material damage is inevitable where a flashover occurs. These damaged locations introduce potential weak points to catenary components which may lead to failure in the future reducing its long-term reliability.\nIn cases where a fault is not automatically detected, the components such as wires can be quickly melted through leading to a dewirement causing further significant infrastructure damage as well as the obvious safety implications of live conductors falling from overhead.\nHow do we find flashover faults and why is it important?\nConventionally identifying electrical flashover faults relies on manual visual inspection. If a section of catenary trips due to a fault, the section is inspected to find it. Depending on the equipment installed and procedure requirements a portion or sometimes even the entire section may require inspection. Using conventional power fault detection equipment, the fault location can be estimated to several hundred meters, in ideal conditions – often significantly more. Where this equipment is not fitted, if the entire section needs inspecting, which may be many kilometres in length, perhaps 20km, this takes considerable time and resources to achieve. If inspections are carried out at night, as is common, then the job becomes even more challenging with many inspections revealing “No fault found”.\nSome faults like a fallen tree may be quite easy to spot. Smaller transient faults caused by birds or a foreign object contacting the catenary can be challenging, if not near impossible to find, as the evidence can be vapourised by the flashover event. Often the only signs are scorch marks on the structure or component.\nIt is important to pinpoint the location of the flashover to give inspections the best chance to find the source of the fault. The fault could be an issue likely to recur in future, or the damage caused by the flashover may lead to reliability issues in the future, e.g., arc damage to a wire leading to future wire break or dewirement.\nThere is now a better way to accurately locate flashover events, saving time, avoiding disruption, improving reliability, and increasing worker safety.\nHow can we find flashover faults faster and more reliably?\nFlashover events are highly energetic, generating significant noise and vibration, for a hopefully very brief period. Sensonic utilises vibration sensing via fibre optics, to detect these vibrations and record them for analysis.\nThis allows Sensonic to remotely locate the flashover to within 10m before anyone needs to set foot onto the track.\nThis accurate location allows inspection and repairs teams to be dispatched directly to the incident site delivering multiple benefits:\n- Improves response and recovery times\n- Improves OHLE team productivity by reducing inspection times\n- Improves safety by reducing time on track\n- Improves future catenary reliability by finding faults that would often be missed\nWant to know more about locating catenary flashovers? See our flashover location application pages or get in touch.\nWhat causes a catenary flashover?\nMany factors can contribute to an electrical flashover, including:\n- High voltage: The higher the voltage, the more likely it is that an electrical flashover will occur. Railway electrification starts at 750V, and many catenary systems are energised with up to 25,000 Volts.\n- Insulation: Insulation helps to prevent electrical current from flowing from one conductor to another. If insulation is damaged, it can increase the risk of an electrical flashover. As air is often used as an insulator, correct air gaps must be maintained.\n- Contaminants: Contaminants, such as dirt, dust, or moisture, can weaken the insulation and increase the risk of an electrical flashover.\n- Weather: High winds, rain, and snow can decrease air insulation gaps and decrease effectiveness of insulators. Hot temperatures or excess ice accumulation can cause the wires to sag.\n- Foreign objects encountering the catenary, e.g., trees, birds or objects blown by the wind\n- Damage to the catenary: Damage from collision or vandalism can degrade insulators or displace components decreasing air insulation gaps.\n- Pantograph faults: Damaged units on trains can cause collision damage as above.\n- Degradation of components: Over time, mechanical components can deteriorate, corrode or fatigue resulting in failure leading to an insufficient air/insulation gap.\n- Vandalism or cable theft\nThe different electrification voltages across Europe\nEurope rail electrification en - Railway electrification - Wikipedia\nA typical flashover timeline\nDifferent railways have different procedures and regulations around catenary traction power faults, however many have an inspection requirement, even if the original fault is only a temporary one. Inspection after a fault has occurred is vital to assess the damage caused and avoid future more serious events occurring in future. If inspection is not triggered or not carried out opportunity to improve the reliability of the catenary system is missed.\nThe inspection process can be significantly improved if the location of a flashover can be accurately determined. This both reduces the inspection time and allows a more thorough inspection of the suspect components to be carried out.\nTo find out more about how we can direct your teams straight to catenary flashover faults contact us.", "scores": {"score": 3, "score_transform_1": 5, "score_transform_2": 5, "score_transform_3": 0}}

He has spent the last four years as the chef at Trevor Kitchen and Bar (38 Wellington Street East).\nWhat inspired you to become a chef?\nFor as long as I can remember I’ve fallen asleep and woken up thinking about food. I love eating and sharing food with people and the experience of restaurants. I don’t care if it’s Canoe (66 Wellington Street West) or a dive in Chinatown, all restaurants are as much about experience as eating. I’ve always loved that and wanted to be a part of it.\nWhat is your favourite dish at the restaurant where you cook and why?\nThe bacon and tomato salad with avocado ranch and crispy shallots. I love it because it’s got a great mix of different flavours and textures that really work together…and it’s absolutely lousy with bacon.\nThree ingredients you couldn’t live without and why?\nAs far as to cook with – salt, lemon and onions. You can’t go without salt or acid in cooking, and onions are just one of those things that end up in everything and they’re so versatile. I heard a great quote once that said “If truffles and onions cost the same amount of money, you would obviously choose an onion. You don’t need truffles; you do need onions.” As far as ingredients for eating – the three b’s of heathfood – bacon, butter and beer.\nOn your day off – what are you cooking at home? If you’re eating out, where do you go?\nWhen I cook at home I usually keep it pretty simple. I eat a lot of roast chicken and salad. When I eat out I mix it up and love trying new places. I go to Chinatown all the time on my days off. I live in Leslieville and I like to support places in my neighbourhood like Ruby Watchco (730 Queen Street East) and Table 17 (782 Queen Street East). I had a great meal at Scarpetta (550 Wellington Street West) recently, too. Otherwise my favourite places are Caplansky’s (356 College Street), The Patrician Grill (219 King Street East), The Black Hoof (928 Dundas Street West) and Colborne Lane (45 Colborne Street).\nWhat is your favourite thing about the food scene in Toronto?\nI think the best thing about the food scene in Toronto is our ethnic food. Especially in Kensington Market and Chinatown, I really think it’s world class. The sheer variety of the restaurants in general is great too.\nWhat’s coming up?\nTrevor Kitchen and Bar will be opening for lunch mid-September.

{"id": "853", "text": "Electronic data interchange (EDI) is one of the most intimidating and often avoided software tools in the world of order fulfillment services.\nSMBs (small- and medium-sized businesses) erroneously believe that EDI is either too expensive or too complicated to be worth the trouble, so instead insist on continuing to try to handle growing commercial orders with a basic shopping cart or worse, manually over the telephone or fax. The truth is that EDI can actually open your business to better opportunities and an increased cash flow with little extra input if you apply it correctly.\nThe Many Parts EDI Plays in Supply Chain Management\nEDI plays such an important part in the supply chain that it can’t be ignored. Once you have access to EDI, you’ll see just how much it can do for you. EDI is about efficiency, order accuracy and saving man-hours.\nHere are some of the more common roles it plays in supply chain management:\nAllowing full order automation. When your orders come in over a fax or through email and then you have a person who transfers them into a piece of order management software, it may not seem like you’re creating a lot of extra work, but when you look at the hours involved it really adds up. EDI can be used in part to fully automate your workflows, including transferring the same order your staff needs an hour to handle manually in mere seconds.\nPreventing order errors. Eliminating the human element as much as possible is the key to increasing your order accuracy exponentially. Although some customers may understand that your people are “only human,” you’ve never heard anyone mutter “to err is to be a computer.” When you use EDI to front end your order fulfillment, you’ll discover that the only place that’s left for mistakes is in the warehouse, where orders are checked and checked again to help reduce human error.\nHandling all the communication with buyers and suppliers. In addition to handling order taking, an EDI can help with the additional communication you typically handle manually. From confirming orders to confirming changes and sending final order acknowledgements, advanced shipping notifications and invoicing, an EDI system can be put in charge of all the busy work.\nEDI is an invaluable tool for SMBs hoping to work with larger outlets that require substantial orders. It’s just another way that you can do a lot more with limited staff. The reduced overhead can really help to increase your bottom line.", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}

{"id": "864", "text": "It is Kokoda season – the key months, after winter sports finals, when scores of Australians make the pilgrimage to Papau New Guinea and the Kokoda Track.\nDespite politicians of all different sizes and ages having walked the track – I quickly discovered it is not easy or without danger.\nSome have died on the walk, many others are injured or suffer from dehydration and heat exhaustion over the nearly 100-kilometre mountainous climb.\nThere are slips, trips and even cases of trench foot with sodden boots.\nMy first wake-up call came soon after arriving at the Holiday Inn Port Moresby on the eve of the trek. A guide arrived back at the hotel with broken ribs – forced to walk a chunk of the track in some pain after a bad fall at a creek crossing.\n\"You should be right,\" others who had completed the journey tell us at the hotel. Little comfort as you go through your pack again trying to work out what you can dump to lighten the load.\nDespite the extreme nature of the physical challenge, Australians are flocking to walk the Kokoda Track in their thousands. A plane crash a few years ago saw numbers plummet but they are on the way up again.\nSome, including former prime minister Paul Keating, describe it as Australia's most important military campaign, a series of battles that may have saved Australia from Japanese invasion.\nFor some, the 96-kilometre track is a historical pilgrimage like the beaches of Gallipoli. They had read moving accounts from authors such as Peter Brune in Those Ragged Bloody Heroes, or Peter FitzSimons's Kokoda.\nFor others, it is a challenge to raise money for charity. I felt deep admiration for the group of 30 women we passed in belting rain, dressed in pink and struggling on the steep muddy slopes, determined to finish and raise money for breast cancer.\nAnd then for some it is the pure physical challenge, the fitness junkies, those who like to push themselves.\nFor me, it was a combination of the history and the physical challenge. What finally motivated me to do it, after years of talking about it, was a surprise ticket from family and friends for my 40th birthday.\nOur group of about a dozen was a combination of all of the above, men, women, even a teenager with his dad, all different backgrounds, an accurate reflection of the eclectic mix of walkers on the track.\nYou don't have to be super fit, just determined!\nAfter shaking off nerves from the trekking stories of those back at the hotel, we flew out early for Popondetta on the north coast of Papua New Guinea.\nIt was then a four-hour bumpy truck ride to the Kokoda plateau and the famous Kokoda airstrip.\nWe started in the north and headed south, retracing in chronological order the key battles. Others begin closer to Port Moresby and head north. It matters little, same mountain to climb.\nFrom the Kokoda airstrip the track meanders through plantations before tackling the first climb up the range.\n\"How easy is this,\" you think to yourself.\nAnd then you hit the first climb.\nNervous banter is replaced by puffing and spluttering, slips and trips. You realise what quadriceps are for and that 96 kilometres is a really long way.\nI found the extreme humidity suffocating, especially given one of our Sunday morning training walks was in freezing temperatures up Mount Donna Buang on the outskirts of Melbourne.\nOur first break is at the picturesque village of Deniki, which consisted of several huts solely used by trekkers with a small grass area and expansive views of the valley and airstrip below.\nAs you kick back, boots off, cup of tea in hand and gaze out towards the distant airstrip, there is a feeling of living an important part of Australian history.\nIt is an amazing spot. The thunderstorms rolling in maximise the impact of the indelible scene.\n\"I am really walking the famous Kokoda Track\"\nFrom Deniki it is arduous hills most of the way, with steep declines to creeks followed by sharp climbs up the other side.\nThe slope comes to meet you on Kokoda and your hands – grabbing roots and rocks to pull yourself up – become as important as your feet in navigating the steep track.\nWhile the mountains are not enormous, the highest point of Mount Bellamy is only 2200 metres, but its rises and falls make the 96 kilometres seem much longer. Add the sauna-like humidity and the belting rain that turns the track into slippery-slide and there is enough to keep you challenged.\nOur next stop, Eora Creek, was the scene of heavy fighting on the Japanese retreat, and is also a spectacular camping site in the Owen Stanley Range, with the gushing creek surrounded by verdant jungle on all sides.\nThe swim in the creek at the end of a long day's walk is one of the most relaxing I can remember.\nA hearty hot meal served up by the porters who are excellent bush cooks is soon followed by bed.\nYou sleep well on Kokoda, a deep exhausted sleep, only broken by the 5am wake up call to begin walking again at 6am.\nThe days can be long\nDo the track in 10 days and you can generally walk about six hours a day. Do it in six and you walk 10.\nWe did it in six.\nThere are plenty of stops along the way and the constant call of \"water up\", meaning you take a long suck from the two-litre water sack strapped to your pack.\nThere were days where it felt like all I did was walk, drink and duck off behind a tree for a toilet break.\nThose who do the majority of work on most treks are the local Papuan porters who accompany you.\nWhile trekkers carry clothes, sleeping bags and medical supplies, the porters carry tents, food, pots and pans.\nWhile trekkers carry 15 kilograms, porters carry in excess of 20 kilograms, some a lot more.\nNot only do they carry more, often in bare feet, they also do a lot more work.\nThe porters cook all meals and set up and dismantle tents and even scurry ahead of trekkers to set up bridge crossings at the dozens of creeks, dry out tents and cook hot meals before the trekkers arrive.\nThe porters are also full of good advice.\nDuring one stop I ventured off towards the nearest tree for a quick toilet break. One shy guide said something in muffled pidgeon and I just smiled and waved. \"yes, thank you\".\nWhat I quickly discovered was that he said, \"don't go there, stinging nettles\".\nI returned in pain and to sounds of laughter.\nThe ingenuity of the porters is amazing, building bridges quickly at creek crossings and then dismantling them and speeding on to the next creek.\nAt the swollen Goldie River, they chopped down a 20-metre tree to make a bridge, only to see it wash away in the strong current.\nOne porter then swam the fast-flowing river and tied a rope to the other bank – we all swam across clinging to the rope with the help of a porter.\nThe track is no stroll through a national park\nDeath is everywhere on the Kokoda Track. The big battle sites, the hidden jungle tombs and even the discreet crosses on the jungle's edge for the several travellers who have perished along the way.\nThe porters are always there to watch your safety. If you look off balance a hand suddenly appears to help. And the guides remind you to keep drinking plenty of fluids, eat enough and tend to jungle wounds. As one of our guides noted, \"all you have to do is walk\".\nWalking is still tough.\nThe rain, creeks and mud soak boots to the point chunks of skin peel off water logged toes like onion skin.\nBlisters are a given. And if you are too proud to wear lycra bike shorts as some members of our party chose to do (yes, I was one of them) you can expect a nice blend of chafe and sweat rash.\nMosquitoes and potent malaria strains are also a constant threat.\nThen there are the hills.\nOne day's walk includes the \"eight false peaks\" – enough said.\nFrom the north coast the track takes you across the Owen Stanley Range to the back door of Port Moresby at Owen's Corner. The Japanese soldiers could see the lights of Port Moresby, their objective, when ordered to retreat.\nAside from the physical challenge of Kokoda, there is the mental challenge.\nEvery hill you walk, every corner you turn, there are signs of battle. Abandoned fox holes, stories of those who died. It is hard to imagine the strain on the soldiers not sure what was over the next hill or in the jungle beside them. It is hard enough walking the track without the fear of imminent death.\nThere are tears from the stories of those who fought and died, including for Butch Bissett who died in his brother Stan's arms at the famous battle of Isurava. Stan sat with his brother for several hours as the battle raged around them and told him stories of their childhood to comfort Butch in his last hours. As you pass the quiet rock where Butch died it is hard to keep it together.\nThen there is the story of Corporal John Metson, who was shot through the foot and the crawled for weeks through the harsh jungle rather than allow his mates to be burdened carrying him. He was later executed by the Japanese.\nAs you near the end of the track and a week of solid hiking, dozens of creek crossings and litres of sweat – it all seems worth it.\nYou forge a strong bond with the other walkers, the guides and porters. There is also a connection with others you meet back home who have walked the track.\nWalking through the arch at the end is a moment you will never forget.\nUnlike many iconic destinations around the world, Kokoda is yet to be touched by commercialism. There are no souvenirs outside the experience.\nAt Kokoda you will learn a little about Australia's military history and much more about yourself. What your mind and body will endure.\nOther holidays and overseas trips will fade, Kokoda you will never forget.\nWhat you need to know\nWalks from 6-10 nights. The quicker the trek, the longer the days. More days are not necessarily easier because they mean more time in the jungle.\n- Carry your pack or pay a porter to carry it for you. You will still need to carry a few litres of water so don't think there is no weight on your back. If it is the difference between doing the trek or not, pay the porter.\n- I went with a combined No Roads and Earth Sea Sky trip. Fantastic tour leaders, porters and excellent cooked food. Pack and water sack supplied.\n- Cost is between $4000 to $6000 including flights. You won't need a lot of spending money, maybe a couple of hundred dollars.\n- 12 weeks training recommended and provided by trekking companies.\n- You don't have to be a marathon runner to do it. All ages and sizes walk the track. Determination is what gets you to the other end.\n- Travel injections: there are not many you don't need for PNG and malaria tablets are a must.\n- Apart from a few changes in direction, the condition of the track is much like what the Australian soldiers experienced in 1942, apart from the fact no one is shooting at you.\n- The best months to walk Kokoda are April to November, when the rivers are passable – even by October the rain can make the Goldie River crossing close to Port Moresby a swim, rather than a walk.\n- Good walking boots and clean socks for each day are a must. I went heavy duty, base-camp-type boots. Lighter, hybrid-style hiking boots would have been better.\nSign up for the Traveller Deals newsletter\nGet exclusive travel deals delivered straight to your inbox.

Encouraged by family and friends to teach people in developing countries how to crochet as a means of breaking the cycle of poverty, they set out to change the world.\nDuring summer breaks in college, the founders volunteered in various developing nations, hoping to gain a better understanding of the issues facing the global community.

There were entire generations growing up only knowing the camp, relying solely on the government and aid organizations for their every need. These people were yearning for independence from these operating bodies and wanted to be able to work and provide for their own families.\nWith the incorporation of close friends who shared the desire to see Northern Uganda transformed by hook and yarn, Krochet Kids applied to become a non-profit organization. The following summer, this passionate crew found themselves sitting in a brick hut with a group of Ugandan women and bags full of yarn.

{"id": "871", "text": "My name is Sarah and this is my story of surviving domestic abuse.\nWe met through mutual friends. I was working as a drugs and alcohol counsellor, delivering group workshops to rehabilitate those in recovery. He was a former drug addict who had committed to a programme and felt it had changed him as a person. I always believed in giving people second chances and admired how far he had come.\nI ended up working in this area because my mum was an alcoholic and I couldn’t save her. As a child I lived in a home with severe domestic violence and to cope with it all my mother turned to alcohol, drinking all day just to feel normal. My dad would come home and smash up the door, throw bottles at the wall, and consistently beat my mum to the point where I would have to lie on top of her to stop him from killing her. It was intensely stressful environment to grow up in, never knowing when he would lose it, always worrying about her safety.\nWhen I was eighteen my mum committed suicide. It devastated me and left me feeling very vulnerable. I began drinking a lot, thinking about the violence that she had suffered. Luckily I had access to counselling and rebuilt my life, creating for myself a normal and calm environment with a stable relationship and two children.\nWhen this relationship broke down, I found myself single and I didn’t like being alone. This was when I met him.\nA gentle giant, he was handsome and charming and took such an interest in me. As a child, my parents never asked where I was, it was always me trying to find them. Suddenly to have someone ask me where I am, what am I doing – I thought he must really care about me. He would ring me all the time to check where I was, what I was up to, or who I was with.\nI identified with his story too. His mum had also been an alcoholic and he had been put into care as a child. He had a terrible childhood, and much injustice had happened to him. When I fell pregnant with my son he became much more controlling, verbally abusive and frustrated. I started to make excuses for his lack of trust in me, rationalising that this was because of his childhood.\nThe first time he hit me was after my son was born. I was holding him and then suddenly there it was. I was shocked. Once that happened, it happened all the time. He would strangle me, pull out my hair, smash things around the house. He was sexually violent, coercing me into doing things I didn’t want to do so he wouldn’t wake the children up. He would say he would never do it again, but he would again and again. I felt so out of control of my own body, my own life.\nI still made excuses however, minimizing my experiences by refusing to equate my violence with that of my mum’s. My mum had her blood spattered on the wall, broken bones.\nI fell pregnant again and then the violence escalated once more. I felt that I was constantly walking on eggshells. I couldn’t do anything right. The food I cooked was too hot or too cold. My body was too fat or too thin. He never thought I looked after the children enough. He would blame me for the abuse, saying that I provoked him, blame me for the police coming because I screamed.\nI started to experience severe panic attacks. Each time I would go to hospital they didn’t pick up on bruises around my neck, they didn’t act. I only wish they had brought in other services. Each time I would call police nothing was taken any further. I didn’t feel confident that the system would protect me.\nThe day I told him I was going to leave him, he flew into a rage, broke my ribs and ruptured my spleen. On arrival at the hospital they found internal bleeding, stating had I come twenty minutes later I might have died. He followed me there and whispered in my ear that if I told them what happened he would break my other ribs too. I couldn’t speak, couldn’t shout as I had to stay really still to receive my blood transfusion. It was terrifying.\nInstead I told the hospital that I had fallen off one of the children’s bunk beds. The consultant was not easily fooled and said I was lying, that either I had been beaten up or been in a car accident, such were the severity of my injuries. I was forced to tell the truth, and social services stepped in. He was arrested but given bail, which made me nervous. Luckily he was soon arrested for an unrelated drugs charge and was put away. He would ring me from jail threatening to kill me, but it was a real sense of relief knowing that he couldn’t.\nThis was when social services put me in touch with Solace Women’s Aid, which really changed my life. My self-esteem was so low due to the daily abuse. He had blamed me so much that there was a part of me that really believed it was my fault. Solace showed me it wasn’t. My caseworker was so nice. She sorted everything out for me, how to get benefits, grants to pay for school uniforms, access to children’s services, even a babysitter. When I had my first job interview Solace helped me go to a place where I could get the right clothes to wear. It was like having a family around me that could help me rise out of the ashes and come back to life.\nThen I started accessing parenting groups and workshops which changed everything. It was like going to a university of recovery. Being with people who have all been through what you have, it was so understanding and supportive.\nMy own children were traumatised by witnessing the abuse, and to this day have issues with behaviour, relationships and trust. My youngest son was so anxious at just five years old, he would ask me to get off the bus if he perceived danger. I want to emphasise how important it is that children get the help they need. When you witness domestic abuse as a child it has a massive impact. It affected me, and it continues to affect my children. We need to make schools aware, to train teachers, to put the right support services in place. I am so thankful that my son benefitted from play therapy at Solace, it has made him better able to express himself.\nThe first month he was released from prison he was spotted near my house and arrested. He was demanding access to the children and I was so nervous about what might happen. Solace helped me with the process to obtain a prohibitive steps order, preventing him from ever contacting the children again. It was an amazing result, and their support right through from speaking to lawyers to appearing in family court – it changed my life and the life of my children’s.\nI am in a place where I am no longer scared of him or his family anymore. I feel confident and empowered to build a better future. I am not ashamed anymore. I want to tell anyone who is going through this or who is struggling in the aftermath, it does get better. You must talk about it, that’s the first step. Tell anyone you feel safe to speak to. Anyone. To all the women who have walked away without support, the trauma is still affecting you. Seek help, there are so many services available.\nI am really lucky that my children and I got the help we needed from Solace.

{"id": "873", "text": "I don't really like using classical music for evaluating systems under show conditions. The environment's generally too noisy to flatter the high dynamic range and delicacy of well-recorded symphonic music. And baroque is just too precious for me to take seriously for anything other than brunch in a quaint bistro. So it's usually jazz for me unless I feel like clearing a room, at which point Mr. Bungle or Tomahawk usually does the trick.\nWhen I walked into the room shared by YG Acoustics and Jones Audio, an Indiana Jones-hatted gent was sitting in the sweet spot chatting with one of the reps. The system was pounding out an absolutely monstrous symphonic piece. This music didn't bother with dynamic range, as it sounded like the needle was pinned at 0dB. It was aggressive and angry, and I just loved it.\nI also knew this piece, but I couldn't place it. It wasn't Holst's \"Mars,\" that's for sure, although it had some similarity. I butted into the conversation and asked the man what was playing, and he told me it was \"The Battle\" from the Gladiator soundtrack. Aha. Now I knew why I was seeing blood and swords in my mind's eye.\nThe music perfectly suited the armor-plated YG Acoustics Anat Reference II Studios, which retail for a princely $74,000 per pair. Despite the show conditions, the music was turned up so bloody loud that the small amount of dynamic range it contained just propelled sound out into the room. The Anats kept up with the volume, sounding clean and clear despite how hard they were being pushed.\nFeeding the Anats were Jones Audio components. This company's new to me, but based on the sound they were getting out of the YG speakers, they merit further investigation. The PA-M300 mono amps go for $28,000 per pair (shown above), while the PRE-S-1 preamp will set you back another $14,000. A Marantz SA-7S1 CD player fed the music in.\nWhether this system sounded good with music played back at a reasonable level, I just don't know. And frankly I don't much care. Listening to \"The Battle\" was a real treat, and I left the room with that memory unsullied.\nSometimes you just need the right piece of music at the right time.\nSenior Contributor, The SoundStage!

South Africa is vast and dynamic, some even call it a world in one country. Hluhluwe Umfolozi Park is the oldest and the first wildlife game reserve proclaimed in 1895. Initially it was Hluhluwe game reserve and later majored with the Imfolozi game reserve and it became a national park. One of the richest wildlife sanctuaries in Africa. This hidden gem of South Africa has been the most successful reserve on the war against rhino poaching and being in the middle of Swaziland and Isimangaliso Wetland Park (St Lucia) and three hours away from King Shaka International Airport, Durban it is easily accessible to nature lovers.\nThe park lost more than 20 rhinos between 2017/18, devastating since the park has been doing very well for the past decades. The number of rhinos killed is less compare to the Kruger National Park which is loosing hundreds of rhinos yearly because of poaching. The rhino poaching is an ongoing war, but there is a hope. If all South Africans can contribute on the rhino poaching programs, the problem will be under control and our next generation will see the endangered rhinos.\nThe villages close to the park are fascinating for international travelers, culture and life style is total different. The Nompondo village cultural walk with a local guide, Mdu worth a visit. The Zulu tribe is the main tribe even though there are other small tribes (Amathonga, for example) in the eastern part of the province. Mdu, the local guide led us into one of the homestead and explaining everything about the Zulu lifestyle. “There is no fence or gate but you cant just enter someones home without the permission”, Mdu said. “Sikhulekile ekhaya” Mdu shouted twice before someone appears and said “ngenani” meaning come in. We entered the house and got seated accordingly, man on the right side and women on the left side.

{"id": "891", "text": "The holidays are coming and it’s the perfect time of year to incorporate a little science into our holiday fun! What? You don’t think those two things go together? Well let me show you how you can inspire your older child to embrace the season with a STEAM activity I’m calling Circuit-Tree! This activity was inspired by our amazingly fun Circuit Bug activity.\nDisclosure: This post contains affiliate links\nFirst off, I need to pause for a moment and bask in the perfectness of the name of this project. You see what I did there, right?\nOK, enough lovin’ of the name, let’s jump into how you can create your own awesomeness known as the Circuit-Tree!\nSTEAM stands for Science, Technology, Engineering, Art and Math and this project is an excellent example of a STEAM project that incorporates all the elements. I recommend this project for children 8 years old and up. Please ensure appropriate safety precautions are taken and that adult supervision is used at all times.\nBefore you do anything else you need to test your LED lights to make sure they work (and your battery for that matter). LED lights have one leg shorter than the other. The shorter leg is negative pin. Slide your round battery between the pins and hold the pins against the battery with your fingers. If the light doesn’t come on, turn the battery around and try again.\nOnce you have all your LEDs working it is time to prepare your wires. Cut them to length, I went with twice the length of my clothespin as a guide. You will need two wires for each LED light. Now strip the ends of your wires. I went with a little less than an inch. I didn’t worry too much about being exact, the main idea is to not go too long as this could cause interruptions in your circuits.\nThis next step can get very confusing very quickly, so it’s important to work systematically. Start by wrapping a wire around the short (positive pin) of an LED. Then repeat on another LED doing only positive pin. I found it easiest to do my LED’s in batches of two. So at this point I twisted the loose ends of those wires together. Now, just above the point where I stripped the wires I added a piece of electrical tape. That way throughout my build I always knew that the wires with electrical tape were my positives.\nNow repeat the same wrapping process on those two LEDs but on the negative pins. Except after twisting together the loose ends do not add electrical tape. Make sense?\nNow repeat on your next two LEDs.\nOnce you have your LED’s wired I recommend testing them by placing your battery between your wire ends. Interruptions in your circuits are easy to do and you want to catch them early. If it doesn’t work, turn your battery around.\nNext step, is to start building the tree. Start by taking one set of two LEDs and slide one LED on each leg of the clothespin. Make sure the positive pins are on the outside, negative (shorter pins on the inside), now carefully wrap electrical tape around the pins to hold the LED in place on the clothespin. Do this on both sides. Then test your LEDs. You want to make sure the pins are not touching any metal on the clothespin as this will interrupt your circuits.\nTo add more lights I simply placed the next set of LEDs on the outside of the electrical tape. Then taped those into place. Test your LEDs!\nOnce all your LEDs are attached to the clothespin and you have confirmed they are working you want to take your positive leads and wrap them all around one end of the clothespin bottom. Trim the wires and re-strip if necessary. Then repeat on the other side with the negative wires. Next, slide the battery in between so it is pinched into place with the wired held against the battery. This is really hard to do and takes some finesse. Adult help will likely be needed.\nNow all your lights should be on! If you have lots of wires, you can use a little electrical tape to tuck them out of the way.\nThis final stage is about having a bit of fun. Using pipecleaners wrap them around the clothespin to create your tree effect. I added a sparkly pipecleaner as garland on top of the green base. You may notice your lights flickering on and off as you build, just adjust if this happens, there is metal in the middle of pipecleaners which can cause a circuit interruption.\nOnce your Circuit-tree is built you probably noticed it is not the most stable thing in the world and it looks funny with the battery and such sticking out the bottom. That is easily solved by building a Lego base to stand your tree up in! I used red 2×3 bricks and built the square base. It holds the tree perfectly and adds to the festive look.\nI hope you enjoyed building your very own Circuit-Tree!\nIf you enjoyed this Circuit-Tree project or just want more details on building circuits like this, check out my Circuit Bug activity and build your own bugs with glowing eyes!\nFor more Christmas activities check out these other articles from STEAM Powered Family.", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

What I got – in the mail – was a free sample from a pen company. I have received pens from this company before, and for the most part, their pens write quite well. I just never needed to order any large quantity of them because pens are so common as takeaways and leave-behinds at shows and meetings.\nSo, what makes this pen special? Aside from the fact that it actually looks attractive and feels good in my hand, and that it has the obligatory customization imprinted on the side (supposedly laser-engraved), it has a special tip that makes all the difference. It has one of those rubber stylus tips that you can use when the pen is retracted to punch numbers and letters on your phone or tablet.\nThis is what makes me want to consider ordering a quantity of these to hand out to people. There is some actual value here – more than just the writing part of the pen. In fact, the stylus may be more important than the ink!\nWe’re always looking for ways to promote our businesses and at the same time offer meaningful value to our clients, customers, and trade partners. That’s why food and drink don’t work so well. They are quickly consumed and forgotten. Typically pens don’t work either because they don’t even write long enough to get to the door.\nAs far as getting a stylus to use for your phone or other device, I have seen them. It’s just that this combines the stylus with a pen – one that actually writes – and a branding message that people can carry with them until they lose it, break it, or get tired of it.

Together we trust, hope, persevere and flourish on life’s great adventure.\nOur vision, established through discussion and consultation over the last eighteen months, puts positive, productive relationships at the heart of everything that we do.

Because of this, here at St Paul’s we promote positive relationships and facilitate honest and open communication between pupils, staff, parents and all other members of the school community.

{"id": "901", "text": "107-The Power of Low-End Products for Industry Leaders\nLow-end products can save an industry’s bacon when the industry falls on hard times. Most low-priced products are what we call Price Leaders (see Audio Tip #83: Price Leader Products and Companies on StrategyStreet.com). These products offer less Function or Convenience than do the industry’s more important Standard Leader products, for common pricing savings of 25% or more. (See Audio Tip #81: Standard Leader Products and Companies on StrategyStreet.com.)\nThese Price Leader products are helping the domestic beer industry today. In the domestic beer industry, Price Leader products are called “sub-premium brands.” These brands saw sales gains of 8% over the last year. In contrast, the industry Standard Leader products, called “premium” beers, saw sales fall 1.4%. “Sub-premium” beers are keeping the industry moving forward. These “sub-premium” beers cost about 25% less than the premium beers, so they offer drinkers an attractive price alternative when the economy gets tough.\nMost of the “sub-premium” beer volumes are products of the big brewing companies, including Anheuser-Busch InBev NV, SABMiller PLC, Molson Coors Brewing Company. (See the Perspective, “When Product Mix Matters” on StrategyStreet.com.) So the industry’s Standard Leader competitors have closed the door on erstwhile Price Leader, private label, suppliers of cheaper brews.\nThese Price Leader products also have a few cost advantages over the Standard Leader products. Most importantly, the big brewers rely on word-of-mouth and price-based impulse buys to generate sales. They spend very little on advertising these brands. On the other hand, they spend a great deal to advertise the “premium” Standard Leader brands. So, while profits are lower on the Price Leader products, the lower margins are nowhere in proportion to the lower prices these products seek.\nFor the last 10 years, the beer industry in the US has been flat. Volume grew by 1% in total but sales grew only 0.1%. Despite the slow growth in the broader market, the number of breweries grew at a rate of nearly 13% from 2016 to 2020. The larger companies seem to have succeeded in shutting the door against new entrants at the low end of the market. Instead, virtually all of the growth in the market is taking place at the higher end, in brewpubs, microbreweries, and superpremium beers and ales. The major brewers have yet to figure out how to slow the newer high-end entrants. In this slow growing market, brewers are ramping up new product development to target fresh consumers. They are introducing hard seltzers, hard kombuchas, hard teas and coffees and CBD beverages, along with low alcohol and no alcohol beverages. These are examples of product proliferation in a challenging market.\nBrewpubs, microbreweries and superpremium beers and ales are examples of Performance Leader products. These products compete on unique Functions. Go HERE to see a discussion about when to compete on new functions.\nHOW CAN THESE BLOGS HELP ME?\nIf you face a competitive marketplace, read these blogs.

{"id": "904", "text": "Tom Hanks got his Oscar nomination for Big. The 1988 comedy was pivotal in making Hanks a proper movie star. Much of the success of this film, and therefore arguably Hanks’s whole career, comes from the mind of Paula Abdul. Here’s how she helped launch Hanks into superstardom.\nTwo Stars On The Rise\nBefore Big, Hanks spent about a decade trying to make it big. He landed a lead role in Bosom Buddies and subsequently got a guest spot on Happy Days. The programs turned the head of Ron Howard, who cast Hanks in Splash in 1984. The mermaid-based comedy became a surprise hit, setting him up to land a few more films over the next few years, like The Money Pit and Dragnet.\nMeanwhile, Abdul was also getting her start in Los Angeles. A talented dancer, Abdul was plucked out of college to become one of the vaunted Laker Girls. She soon became the squad’s head choreographer before moving into the music video game.\nAbdul befriended the Jacksons thanks to her Los Angeles Lakers connection and soon began doing choreography for the whole Jackson family. She laid out the dance moves for The Jackson’s huge Victory tour in 1984, and for smash hits like Janet Jackson’s “Nasty” and “Control.”\nA Very Famous Scene\nAbdul and Hanks’ paths crossed in Big. Abdul was the one responsible for choreographing the legendary giant keyboard dance routine with Hanks and Robert Loggia. Even if you haven’t seen the film, the scene made an indelible mark in popular culture. The likes of Homer Simpson and Peter Griffen would recreate the scene in years to come.\nHanks gave Abdul immense credit. He told her, “My biggest claim to fame…is that you once choreographed me.” Considering Hanks was already racking up Academy Awards he said this, that is some high praise.\nRest Is History\nThe Penny Marshall-directed film went on to gross over $151 million over a budget of $18 million. While it scored Hanks his first Oscar nomination for Best Actor, but he would lose to Dustin Hoffman for Rain Man. No bother, as Hanks would pick up back-to-back statues in 1993 and 1994 for Philadelphia and Forrest Gump respectively, not to mention three more nominations in the years that followed his wins. It all worked out just fine for him.\nLife only got better for Abdul as well. Within a year of Big, she scored three number one hits. About a decade later she became a star judge of the behemoth known as American Idol. To think everything really started looking up for Hanks and Abdul at the exact same moment.\nMore News From Suggest", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

MITRE ATT&CK is actually a knowledge base created for collecting tactics, techniques, and procedures utilized by threat actors during cyber-attacks. Earlier this year a team of cybersecurity professionals from ConnectWise utilized this data to identify the most common techniques utilized to compromise information systems. The top two methods utilized by threat actors in 2021 were Phishing and valid accounts.\nThe two go hand-in-hand, account information is often acquired during a successful Phishing campaign. Either way, what is clear is that personnel is the first line of defense in protecting company data. Do not allow yourself or a member of your staff to be exploited, inadvertently giving away the keys to the system. Begin by implementing a security awareness training program within your organizations. Review these programs regularly, don’t set it, and forget it. Ensure that they continue to meet the needs of your organization.\n🤔 Password Protocol\n“Have you heard that Microsoft recently advised against password changes?”\nFrequently changing passwords may lead to easily cracked passwords due to making minor modifications to passwords that have been utilized for decades. We are not suggesting to end the practice of regularly changing password. Many organizations are required to implement this practice to meet regulatory and compliance requirements. We are recommending that complex password policies are enforced and MFA (Multifactor Authentication) is implemented as an additional level of protection. If an account has been compromised by a threat actor, MFA may be the last level of defense capable of disrupting the attack.\nCome One, Come All! 📣\nPeter will be part of an expert panel discussing all things cybersecurity as a part of MassMEP’s Manufacturing Your Future i4.0 event at Polar Park in Worcester.

{"id": "908", "text": "The penalties for underage drinking can be harsh — from losing your driver’s license to being suspended from college. Here’s the bottom line on what happens if you get caught drinking under 21 years old.\nAs the parent of a teenager, you want them to have a fun and productive high school experience. The teenage years are when kids get their first taste of independence and start testing boundaries as they spend more time away from home with their friends. Today’s teens face many pressures. Academic and athletic pressures typically take center stage. But, in between monitoring your child’s GPA, cheering them on from the sidelines at a game, and helping them shop for prom attire, one of the most vital matters parents need to address on a regular basis is underage drinking.\nUnderage Drinking by the Numbers\nAlcohol is never the answer, and it’s often a problem. It may be hard to imagine, but more teenagers are drinking than you may think. At least 7 million kids between ages 12 and 20 drank more than “just a few sips” of alcohol in the past month. To make matters worse, excessive drinking kills an average of close to 4,000 kids under the age of 21 each year, the National Center for Drug Abuse Statistics reported. A survey conducted by the Centers for Disease Control revealed that, within the last 30 days, 17% of teens rode with someone who had been drinking alcohol.\nWhat’s the Bottom Line?\nAll parents are concerned about the danger of underage drinking. No one wants their child to become a statistic. While it’s essential to lay the ground rules for a no-tolerance policy when it comes to drinking at home, it’s important to learn the consequences if a child does get caught drinking before they turn 21. The penalties can be severe, and having frank discussions with your child about the consequences of underage drinking is a key deterrent for preventing alcohol consumption.\nThe penalties for underage drinking vary by state. Many teens know the blood alcohol concentration limit for adults is .08%, but limits for kids are much lower. In North Carolina, it is ZERO%! It’s safe to conclude that even a few sips of alcohol can put a teen over the legal limit.\nThe North Carolina State Highway Patrol states that people under age 21 simply cannot drive with any alcohol or illegally used drugs in their systems — period. Any amount of alcohol will result in an immediate 30-day pretrial revocation. If an underage drinking driver refuses to take such a test, he or she now need only have the smell of alcohol on their breath to be convicted of driving after drinking. Offenders will have their licenses revoked for one year but can get limited driving privileges reinstated by a judge if the driver was at least 18 years old at the time of the offense and did not have a prior conviction.\nNorth Carolina laws also state that it is unlawful for anyone under the age of 21 to have in their possession, purchase or attempt to purchase, or consume any alcohol products. It is also unlawful for anyone over the age of 21 to give, buy for, or serve those under the age of 21 any alcohol products. If a teen is caught purchasing, using a fraudulent ID, carrying, or consuming alcohol, they will be violating the North Carolina alcohol laws and charged with a Class 1 misdemeanor. Make sure your teen is familiar with the laws. They might be making the right choice not to drink, but if they are hanging out with people who are imbibing, they aren’t in the clear. Constructive possession can be applied if police believe the minor may have an “intent” to drink, such as attending a party where alcohol is served or if they are riding in a car with alcohol.\nViolation of the laws may include:\n- Revocation of driver’s license for a minimum of 30 days\n- Monetary fines\n- Offense on criminal record\n- Community service\nColleges may have their own rules if students are caught partying by campus police. Students may get kicked out of campus housing or even suspended from school. Not surprisingly, college students who drink are more likely to miss class and receive lower grades overall, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Association revealed.\nUnderage Drinking Can Be Costly\nNot only are the penalties for underage drinking severe, but they can also put a dent in your bank account. Following a DUI, many states require teens to carry pricey, high-risk insurance for a period. In addition to legal fees and court costs, your teen may have to participate in a substance abuse class or attend counseling to get their license back. And these are only the minimum fees. If your teen was in a car crash, the price tag will be significantly higher.\nSafety Starts at Home\nMinimum drinking ages, graduated licensing, and zero-tolerance policies are lowering the number of teens who try alcohol. While laws are effective deterrents, the best prevention starts on the home front. Diligent parents can spot the signs of underage drinking and start a conversation about the dangers. Even though it may seem like your teen doesn’t value your opinion, you are still a role model, and they do hear you!\nStart the Conversation with your child by making sure they understand your family’s consequences for underage drinking. Talk it Out NC recommends establishing a no-tolerance policy for alcohol consumption. Here are some helpful tips to start talking to your child about the danger of underage drinking.\nKnow the Facts. The penalties for underage drinking are severe. But they aren’t the only reason teens need to avoid alcohol. Learn how alcohol can have a lasting impact on brain development. Teens who drink alcohol are at an increased risk for developing an alcohol use disorder later in life. Underage drinking can also lead to difficulty at school, misuse of other substances, and an increased risk of suicide.\nDefine the Rules. Once you’ve helped your child understand the dangers of underage drinking, it’s a good idea to outline your family’s rules. Come up with a list of consequences your child may face at home if they decide to drink alcohol. The penalties for getting caught by the police are already stiff and parents should not be afraid to take a firm stance on underage drinking. If you keep alcohol in the house, make sure your teen knows it’s off limits. Consistent enforcement of your house rules is important.\nEven if your child understands the punishment for drinking, peer pressure and the desire to fit in can be a challenge. Even the most well-behaved kids can find themselves in a situation they regret. Develop a code word your child can text you if they feel unsafe or end up in a tough spot. Agree upon using the aid of a location app for pickup spots. To make the code word effective, your teen should not face negative repercussions if they enlist your help.\nTake the Pledge. Pledge to be safe around alcohol to help prevent underage drinking. Talk it Out NC offers a pledge both kids and parents can take on their website. As part of the pledge, kids resolve to not drink and drive, decline rides from people who are drinking, agree to text parents if they feel unsafe, and continue talking about underage drinking with their parents. As part of the online pledge, teens also receive periodic texts with tips on how to stay safe. Parents pledge to set healthy examples when it comes to drinking and keep the lines of communication open.\nStart the Conversation\nUnderage drinking has lasting repercussions. Take the Pledge with your child when they are young to help keep them safe. Talk it Out NC can provide you with more information on alcohol and has tips on how to Start the Conversation to stop underage drinking.", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}

Seek legal advice before signing an agreement.\n- If you are a seller; ensure any agreement you sign is subject to the buyer obtaining appropriate insurance cover. If you’re concerned about the insurance position of your buyer, then double check with your lawyer or salesperson before signing a Sales and Purchase Agreement.\n- If you are a seller and have accepted an offer, unconditional or otherwise, double check the insurance position with your lawyer or salesperson promptly.\n- If you are a buyer and have made an offer that’s gone unconditional and you don’t have insurance, consult your lawyer and salesperson as soon as possible.\nDavid Graves says while the Earthquake Commission (EQC) has a role to play, private insurance is necessary.\n“EQC’s exposure on buildings is limited to $100,000, so private insurance is required (land exposure is uncapped). If a buyer can’t obtain appropriate insurance cover it’s unlikely they will be able to secure mortgage finance - and a Sales and Purchase Agreement may not be finalised.\n“Working with an insurance broker can help you navigate the current insurance landscape, and also check in with your bank to see if any options are available. If you’re uncertain about anything to do with insurance, you should contact your lawyer or salesperson to work through any potential issues,” says David Graves.", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

{"id": "911", "text": "Whether you’ve dealt with the criminal justice system or you simply watch crime-themed television programs, you are probably familiar with a person’s Miranda rights. These rights are a very important part of a criminal suspect’s constitutional rights. A suspect has the right to remain silent and the right to legal counsel. If the suspect agrees to talk to police without an attorney present, then the suspect is considered to have “waived” his right to remain silent, as well as his right to counsel (during the questioning).\nObviously, one of the major keys to any successful criminal defense is keeping out evidence that is harmful to the defense case. One way that can happen is if the defendant made a statement or confession to police after waiving his Miranda rights, but that waiver wasn’t valid. A valid waiver must be “knowing,” “voluntary” and “intelligent.” There are many ways that a defendant’s waiver can be invalidated, including proof that he was confused, was intoxicated, or that he lacked the intellectual capacity to give a valid waiver. What all this establishes is that, even if a defendant confessed to the police, the defendant may still have options and opportunities to obtain an acquittal. That’s why, if you or a loved one are facing charges, don’t give up and don’t go without counsel; retain an experienced Tampa Bay criminal defense attorney to handle the case.\nAn example of this was on display in a recent case that originated in Polk County. J.W. was, at the time of his arrest, an 18-year-old man with cognitive delays. Two deputies from the Polk County Sheriff’s Office questioned the teen regarding an unsolved sex crime. A sergeant read J.W. his rights and he said he understood. He also signed a waiver form.\nThe police questioned the teen. He denied committing the crimes, then cried and asked for his “mommy,” then confessed. During a recorded statement, he again denied committing the crimes and then confessed once again. After the confession, several psychologists examined J.W. They determined that he had a third- to fourth-grade reading level, low IQ and was “susceptible to suggestibility.” The charges were later dropped without prejudice and the state re-filed several years later.\nIn the man’s eventual trial, the court refused to grant the defense request to suppress the confession. The judge rejected the defense’s argument that J.W. did not knowingly and intelligently waive his rights before confessing, and J.W. was ultimately convicted and sentenced to life.\nA defendant has to understand the Miranda warning for the waiver to be valid\nThe appeals court later threw out that conviction and sentence. The appeals court’s ruling stated that the defense was correct in arguing that J.W.’s waiver of his rights was not knowing and intelligent. As the court explained in its decision, “intellectual disability alone does not render a confession involuntary.” However, in this case, there were multiple doctors who testified that J.W. did not understand the Miranda warnings read to him and one who stated that the man “probably never has understood Miranda Warnings.” When one doctor asked J.W. what the right to remain silent meant, he responded, “You have to be quiet until the person says to talk.” All the evidence the defense provided was enough to show a waiver that was not sufficiently knowing and voluntary, which meant that the confessions should have been suppressed.\nThe law presumes everyone to be innocent until proven guilty, and gives everyone certain constitutional rights to ensure that their prosecution is a fair one. One of those rights is the right to counsel. If you or a loved are facing criminal charges or are being questioned in relation to a crime, exercise your rights.

{"id": "912", "text": "In our previous article \"Relationship of DNA with carriers of natural information and ancient symbols\" we looked at the ancient symbols of natural information-Lion/Fire and CROWN/WATER-for a more detailed subsequent consideration of what happens to our DNA molecule in the images, symbols, signs on ancient frescoes, paintings, icons, bas-reliefs, etc.\nImages and their connection\nOur ancient ancestors thought in images, even in schools, they say, there was a similar subject where they taught reading and thinking in images, but then, of course, it was canceled so that no one would learn it and, accordingly, could not. So, we need to learn anew: look at pictures and think in images based on them. Of the 2 images, the third should turn out to be a mental image in the head. Many saints even hold two fingers for us on icons, paintings, frescoes to tell us the number of images, as on\nFig.01 Baptism of the Lord or in Fig.02 Icon of the Saints below, with images to think about.\nI hope that you have already understood that ancient icons, paintings, frescoes depict not people, but images and encrypted symbols that you do not need to look at and describe - in what dress they are or to whom they bow, but with which you need to think and imagine what is depicted in this picture, icon, fresco. And Jesus Christ -everywhere and everywhere - is not a person depicted, but an image of a photon of light in radiation (radiated light around the head), which goes to us in DNA (in the head in Fig.01) by radiation from the Sun / Moon (A ray from the Sun / Moon in Fig.01).\nAt the bottom of the same icon - Fig.01- 2 fish are depicted - the image of 2 DNA helices in electromagnetic radiation (gray background).\nIt is necessary to think in 2 images so that what you see on frescoes, icons, paintings are displayed in the 3rd image visually in your thoughts, dreams, and then back to you with information about it and later materialized. 02 on the right shows St. Nicholas the Wonderworker with a \"raspaltsovka\") into two images, and on the left is St. Spyridon of Trimifunt with images of natural information - Fire / Sun / Moon and Water.\nDifferent people in ancient times depicted the image of DNA in different ways in their works: somewhere with flowers, somewhere with children - the flowers of life (Fig.04)., somewhere with a couple of women, and the Sumerians and our Pushkin depicted DNA in their works as fish and DNA scales (Fig.03)\nAlso, on some \"coats of arms\" (Fig.07) in ancient books, both flowers and 2 fish are depicted on one \"coat of arms\" at once, because these are all images of the same DNA molecule, which is depicted here in the form of two twisted chains above the \"coat of arms\", and to the right and left of the \"coat of arms\" (Fig.07) shows a figuratively approximate principle of an electrical switching circuit (diagram in Fig.09), according to which DNA works (red-fiery hanging brushes-images).\nFigure 08 shows the Mother of God with a baby, in whose attire figuratively half in red symbolizes Fire/The sun, and the second half of the garment - blue color-symbolizes Water. The Virgin points to the red robe-Fire/The sun is an image of radiation through which DNA works according to the scheme of an electrical switching circuit, shown on the left in the image of a red-fiery-hanging fringe with tassels on the hat in the same Figure 08.\nSince DNA is a microcrystalline liquid (Fig.12), i.e., a liquid crystal, it works like computers-on liquid crystals. In electrical networks, both-DNA and computers-work on the principle of parallel and serial connection of elements (from electrical engineering-schemes in Fig.13 and Fig.14-schemes for connecting brushes). In the case of DNA, the elements of the connection are brush images, which are mentally figuratively formed in a person's head and then electrically connected in space.\nPlace and Method of Immaculate Conception of DNA\nThe idea of the place and method of formation of our DNA led me to consider the painting \"The Immaculate Conception of the Virgin Mary\" in Fig. 16 and the painting with the same name in the title of the article with my presentation of images from the painting. In fact, it turns out that the DNA molecule is formed by solar radiation in the glands of the Virgin Mary (about salivary glands from anatomy and Wikipedia).\nWikipedia: Salivary glands(lat. glandulae salivariae) are glands in the mouth that secrete saliva.\nThe glands we are talking about, apparently, are salivary, with their saliva secret isolated (from anatomy), since we are talking about DNA. It is possible that we are also talking about the formation of DNA in the pineal gland, in general, in the head, where the sun Ray of radiation from the Sun-God the Father (the elder at the top of the picture) points to the Virgin Mary in Fig.16.\nIt turns out that the radiation of the Sun carries information for DNA to the glands and then stores it in the DNA in these very glands. This information comes with solar radiation for the existing 3 \"fiery\" DNA elements or for the formation of these 3 \"fiery\" elements in DNA, which I analyzed in the last article on the tablets of Isis (link at the beginning of this article). It seems that these 3 elements - copper, mercury and iron-are either already in our DNA and they are exposed to solar radiation for the purpose of some kind of transformation. Or these elements are initially formed in DNA saliva by solar radiation on a person for the same conception.\nRays emanating from the Sun are direct solar radiation/radiation; Reflected water radiation/radiation is radiation that is reflected by water or the earth's surface from the Moon.\nScattered solar radiation is formed when the light flux from the Sun is scattered.\nThe same thing with \"water\" elements from the same place (from the same article): lead, tin, silver are either already in our DNA and they are exposed to water \"radiation\" for the purpose of some kind of transformation. Or these elements are formed in DNA saliva by means of water \"radiation\" on a person for the same conception.\nThe fact that radiation has a negative effect on our DNA is told to us everywhere, but about the fact that there is also a positive effect of various radiations on DNA - it is silent. (Of course, radiation is different from radiation, but it is known that everything is poison and everything is medicine, only the dose matters.\nFigure 16 shows the immaculate conception by the radiation of DNA saliva (Symbol-flowers:2 flowers above the columns) of a person with images and symbols, which occurs with the help of the image of God the Father - a gray-haired elder above the columns, which is the actual Sun. And also, the conception depicted occurs with the help of the image of the Holy Spirit - an Angel (in the picture in a pink dress and with wings), which is actually a photon of light from solar radiation in the image with a halo of light - an aura. From the actual Sun, a light ray is shown - a dove - an image of the solar radiation of light quanta that goes to the Virgin Mary and which carries information to her for DNA saliva (from anatomy), then stores it in DNA saliva. At the same time, DNA-saliva is already immaculately conceived with information in its glands, and subsequently, apparently, the stored DNA-saliva information is already used from there, if necessary, it seems that already at the real birth of a person.\nIt turns out that only part of the DNA genes we get from our parents and another part of the DNA we get in the information from nature (most likely the one that \"scientists\" call us \"garbage\").\np.s. everything that is considered in the article is the thoughts and fabrications of the author of the Owl and may not coincide with the thoughts of readers and owners of the site.", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}

{"id": "914", "text": "You know what really pisses me off as of late? Bands that are overly built up in the press and fall flat when you see them live, that’s what! You go to a show on the advice of others, trusting that what you are about to hear and see will fulfill the expectations you have set for the experience you are about to have. I mean is it me or are there an insane amount of bands that just can’t put on a good show anymore?! Well just recently, I came face to face with a group that surprised the hell out me.\nRED SUN RISING is not “really” new to the game we call rock. They originated a whisker over a decade ago, but they didn’t fully jump into the active rock world until after they signed to Razor & Tie Records back in 2014. Now, I can honestly say this band doesn’t come across as inexperienced by any means. If you were not familiar with their upbringing, you would assume that they were 30 years in. I know that you might scoff at that considering there are so many bands in the same segment as Red Sun Rising. So much so that you could get confused on who you were actually listening to. If you were to look out across a current chart listing, the names would all bleed together, like a Sharpie on a sheet of paper. This band stands out in my mind because there seems to be something different about them. Is it an artistic sensibility that drives them? Yes, they can get in your face lyrically, so don’t think they are all peace love and happiness; regardless what their logo’d merch might suggest. Their art drives an internal aggression it seems, and a dark one at that.\nThat spins us fast forward to their recent full-length release ‘Thread’. This record is an example of a band hitting their stride artistically, plain and simple. There seems to be a real effort to step away from the obvious vanilla taste of the others in their genre. The track “Deathwish” puts a real hard foot forward to that mantra. This song approaches topical with a darkness that pulls at you throughout.\nTheir other standout “Fascination” pulls slow tonal and melancholy cues from The Cranberries’ “Zombie” but hot-rodded up with a bit of a stringed bite. Is the homage blatant? I don’t think so. I find it honest coming from a band that might be coming to terms with who they really are. We are all made up of many parts; some make a bigger impact than others do. If you look back over the band’s previous hits off ‘Polyester Zeal’, they always seemed to be exploring who they are and what they are comprised of.\nRED SUN RISING is currently out on their own headlining tour in support of ‘Thread’, and I think it is the best thing that they could have done for the band’s progression. While they were out on tour opening up for POP EVIL back a few years, they couldn’t spread their intellectual wings enough. After seeing them perform in Dallas, this band needs to be let loose to meander as needed. To clarify a bit, this band doesn’t work well playing second or third fiddle. That isn’t because they are too pompous to follow, but rather they are really best with no ceiling to hold them down!\nIf you get the chance to go and see this band, do not second-guess your opportunity. Just as they have seemingly come to terms with themselves, you need to follow where the art takes you.", "scores": {"score": 0, "score_transform_1": 0, "score_transform_2": 0, "score_transform_3": 1}}
{"id": "915", "text": "A risk with many food safety audits is that they contain so much detail only the food safety specialists in an organisation take any notice of the reports. The usual way to counter this 'audit fatigue' is to produce management summaries of the audits to show the main findings and trends. These summary reports can help to drive improvements, especially when linked to performance management systems, but a valuable addition can be to involve senior managers in the audit process.\nBusy managers are not going to do the full 'walls-floors-ceilings' routine, but if the aim is only to provide a personal snap-shot of the standards in a unit, then we can use a few 'key indicators' to highlight the way food safety is being managed in a unit. The benefit of this approach is to engage the operational hierarchy by encouraging them to apply their management skills to food safety.\nThis is similar to the way experienced leaders manage financial performance in their operations. When regional managers are visiting a unit they will ask the site manager about certain key indicators of performance, such as like-for-like sales, staff turnover and waste - then they'll use their experience to coach the manager in areas needing improvement.\nThe idea of the One Minute Audit is is to apply this technique to food safety. If we could develop an efficient way for senior management to spot the key 'food safety management' issues in a unit, then they could coach to the site manager in ways to improve performance. The success of this management intervention can then be measured using the formal audit reports, in the same way the company P&L measures the financial success of business.\nAll experienced auditors will have develop ways of assessing standards using some key indicators of performance, and in practice the balance of the audit is just to gather supporting evidence. The secret of the One Minute Audit is to distil these key indicators into a simple checklist, then train managers in basic audit skills plus give them the knowledge to coach their teams. Common indicators will include specific pieces of equipment that often get overlooked if managers fail to implement effective cleaning schedules - the head of the post mix drinks dispenser, the interior of the ice maker, the blade of the table mounted can-open.\nThen there's the indicators of how the site manager maintains hygienic practices - do the training records cover the current staff team, are the temperature records 'real', did the manager wash his/her hands on entering the food preparation room.\nIf we equip senior managers with the capability to assess standards and drive improvements, we can move the accountability for food safety management from the technical specialist into the hands of the line management.", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}

Today we are going to answer some of the most burning questions circulating in our minds.\nNote: Please keep in mind that parts of the answers are based on our personal opinions. Of course, we will list the sources of where we got the rest of the information.\nWhere to find COVID-19 statistics in my area?\nCoronavirus has been involved drastically and now there are many statistic-based websites where you can get the latest coronavirus data. One of them which we particularly liked is ncovtrack.com. ncovtrack.com displays detailed statistic data down to every county from multiple countries including the US, UK, Germany and more as well as historical data, dashboards and maps.\nShould I be worried?\nWell, it highly depends. If you have travelled, have been in a big social and tight event with lots of people (such as concert or wedding) or felt unwell or sick such as fever, high temperature, continuous cough or had diarrhea during the last 2 weeks, then I would strongly advise you to stay at home and not go out at all for at least 14 days. Some Health organizations prefer to say 7 days but to absolutely minimize the chances of getting infected, 14 days is the key number. Getting food during this period should only be done by delivery.\nHowever, if the above don't apply to you, then you should worry that much. If you follow the rules given to you by your Health service in your country (NHS for the UK) then you should be mostly fine.\nWhat are your best tips to prevent getting infected?\nOur very best tips are listed below:\n- Don't go out unless:\n- Going for Shopping. Try going to minimarkets instead and the closest to your home as possible. That way you will get in contact with as few people as possible. Even that should be done as infrequently as you can. If you are very worried and there are lots of cases in your city, order food by using delivery services.\n- Absolute essential work. This is work where cannot be done from home. Even that, should be done by at most 2-people meeting. Again, if there are lots of infections in your area, city or county, try and see if you can postpone the meeting. Say NO to your friends when they ask you to go out.\n- Medical needs. In most of the countries, if not all countries, the covernment ordered pharmacies and grocery shops to stay open. If you need and medical supplies, go to your local pharmacy ASAP.\n- Exercise. This is only for going out for a run by yourself. Try to keep the running distances as short as possible and close to your house. This is only if you don't have any exercising or gym facilities in your house. In my case it take it to the even more extreme level. To keep myself healthy, I jog up and down then I do the basic exercises such as push, ups and abs. I even filled my bag with books to do bicep curls. Be creative!\n- Follow basic health safety measurements such as:\n- Wash your hands as frequently as possible. Try to wash your hands for 20 seconds or sing happy birthday while washing them. There is no excuse not for not washing your hands as soon as you return from your grocerings or pharmacy. If you stay with other people in your house, erge them to wash their hands too.\n- Have a sanitiser with you at all times, even when you go out and use it frequently.\n- Don't touch your face after touching a foreign object. Use your sanitiser first.\n- If possible, purchase a mask and wear it while you are out for shopping, pharmacy or absolute essential work.\n- If you are going out for essential work and there is no other way around it, make sure there is a distance between you and the other person of at least 2 meters (6 feet).\n- Keep yourself and your house clean. Have a shower at least once a day. Make sure to wash your clothes as frequently as possible. Chances are your clothes will be in contact with a foreign object containing the virus. Changing your clothes as soon as you go home and immediately having a shower is a must.\nHow to \"survive\" a lockdown?\nBeing in a lockdown is definitely not very fun. Those who are depending on activities occurring away from home will be sadly affected the most. This includes students, business owners, employees etc. Here we came up with as many tips to survive a lockdown as possible:\n- Convert activities you would normally do out of your house into virtual. For instance, use a video chat software (Skype, FaceTime) whenever possible to chat with your teammates or your close ones. We are social species and we occasionally have the need to interact with others.\n- Get a computer! Despite now most of the jobs have been converted or being done electronically, there is still a small number of people who don't have access to a computer. Make sure to get one as soon as you can. If you have a smartphone, that tip would be less of a worry.\n- Study remotely. If your school offers remove study, make most out of it. If you are a college student and your library is still open, see if you can borrow some books from there. Staff will also be aware of how disruptive this situation can be, so they will be willing to help you when you need it.\n- As a student, see if you can get/borrow further equipment from your school or university if it's still open and contact your professors if you cannot have access to them and possible alternative options.\n- Ask if you need help. Contact your Health service if you need more help regarding the current situation.\n- Be active with the news from the TV. All measurements/restrictions taken now are on \"the fly\" and are subject to change according to the rate of spread of the virus.\n- Make sure to let the sun to \"enter\" your house. When the sun is exposed to your skin, it produces Vitamin D from cholesterol. See further info here.\nIs there anything else I need to know?\nNo, that's everything. If you still have time, you can have a read on how the virus got started or the about the virus itself. Learning more about the virus, you are gaining a deeper understanding of the restrictions and confidence helping you to stay safer.\nOn top of that, be sure to be up to date with the news.

When you share any content, you usually give up control of it.\nTable of Contents\nDelete Your Accounts On Social Networks That You Don’t Use And Your Profiles On Online Shopping, Dating, And Other Sites\nDeactivating your account does not delete the data but hides your profile from your friends and searches.

The rise of biometric data-scraping ( some companies build their facial recognition databases from images retrieved from Facebook and Instagram ) shows that social networks pose a considerable threat to privacy.\nUse a VPN.

While bad internet habits can be potentially problematic, a VPN can help keep your activities private and secure.\nAlso Read: Internet Search Engines", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}
{"id": "923", "text": "We share with blog readers the results of a study conducted on the B2B market.\nThe task is to understand the motives for choosing contractors and the principal value of cooperation. On this occasion, we had our hypotheses.\nSome companies have been developing digital marketing and sales strategies for ten years. Previously, digital had little penetration into the B2B sphere. Personal selling remained the primary sales tool, and the central problem was the need for more sales growth and the loss of customers.\nThe approach of most market participants has stayed the same, but the transition to digital tools has begun. Many now consider working with an online audience as a solution to the problem of low sales. They start social networks based on “being on the wave”.\nIn pursuit of leads and trends, attention is paid to communication with the client and, most importantly, his deep tasks. We call for a return to understanding the goals and objectives of the client. The job that the client is hiring you for. This is not only the development of an advertising campaign, software installation, customs clearance or the supply of components. Your competitors can do all this. Sometimes even cheaper or faster.\nAn in-depth interview helped us to look into the client’s values.\nAn in-depth interview is an opportunity to express yourself in an accessible form. We seek to know the interviewee’s emotions and point of view on the issue on which attention is focused.\nQuestions are not as rigidly defined as in a survey. The general scheme of the interview is planned, and during the conversation, the interviewer independently determines which question to go to or asks additional clarifying questions. Depending on the situation, the interview can take 30 minutes to several hours. The main focus is confidential communication. We need an honest assessment of the issue of interest. The specialist must be able to overcome the isolation and tension of the respondent.\nTo get detailed answers and understand the logic of decision-making, following the person’s thoughts and engaging in dialogue is essential. Therefore, no other method of questioning is suitable.\nThe Main Motive For Choosing A Supplier In B2B\nThe results did not surprise us. Hypotheses were in the air, and 80% of the market refused to notice them. Therefore, the marketing of most companies in the B2B sector is still at the level of 2022.\nSo, 100% of the surveyed owners and top managers named personal sympathy as the primary motive for choosing a supplier. The right words and arguments, the manifestation of expertise. It looks objective, but it is essential to understand that it will be something different for everyone.\nAt the same time, the owner-owner option was considered the most successful communication format. Great, but where do those “right people” come from? Most commercial offers go to waste, and the most popular response to a cold call is, “We don’t need it.”\nB2B market participants confidently called a recommendation the best reason to contact a particular company. This fact raises the institution of reputation in B2B to a new level. Think about how long ago the approach to solving complex customer problems and handling complaints was revised.\nAre you ready to quickly and effectively fix the mistake? Who in the company is engaged in primary communication with customers? What is the feedback there?\nWhat Sales In B2B Do Not Work?\nWhat about cold calls? What KP to prepare to get a contract?\nEverything is evident here. The course has long been taken on an individual approach and expertise. Most B2B services and products are complex and require knowledge of the customer’s product and business.\nThe situation when a company tries to warm up the market with the help of cold calls is a thing of the past. Respondents unanimously stated that calls made by inexperienced employees are only annoying. When the conversation goes beyond the sales script, such managers often need help to keep the conversation on the same level as the decision-maker.\nDuring the study, it became clear that the trend towards an individual approach only affected some. Only a few companies demonstrate a deep understanding of customer needs. Sending a general commercial proposal without considering the client’s objectives is still the norm.\nWhat Is The Corporate Client Waiting For?\nWhat worries me? What are the challenges facing owners?\nEach market is different, and so are contractors’ tasks. However, three commonalities are visible when deciding whether to hire or change a supplier.\n- The first is the level of communication. A corporate client needs to keep everything under control. What can go wrong? The contractor needs to get in touch, provide a regular report, or take a long time to implement the requested work adjustments. In such a situation, the client spends energy worrying and trying to contact and could – on developing his business.\nAs a contractor, the frequency of communication may be sufficient. Accept that this is your vision of the situation and agree with the client on acceptable terms of interaction before the entire market learns from a dissatisfied client that you cannot be trusted.\n- The second is saving the client’s time. Everything is necessary here. How quickly you will deal with the difficulties, whether you will involve the client in this and in what form you will begin to discuss the project. The main job for which the client hires a contractor is to stop wasting time on decision-making and control. The task should cease to exist, and the result of the work should remain clear.\nWe like the saying, “The client doesn’t want to see you push; he wants to see the baby”. So don’t invite the client to birth with you.\nIf you understand that the perception of each party’s contribution has changed over time, discuss the new arrangements with the client.\n- The third is confidence and security. What do we fear most in business? Lose money and time. Which of these is more important? There is only one task – to show the client your expertise and give guarantees. It’s often better to immediately stop doing tasks you can’t handle. Refrain from trusting communication with clients to employees who cannot communicate with the client professionally and on an equal footing.", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

{"id": "926", "text": "Distributed Alarm System with DAKSmed in keeping with IEC60601-1-8\nThe excessive number of alarms in hospitals and clinics undoubtedly leads to a desensitization of hospital and clinic staff (\"Alarm Fatigue\"). With the distributed alarm system consisting of DAKSmed, Dräger Patient Monitors, Infinity Gateway and mobile handsets, you can forward these alarm conditions to mobile devices in a highly individual way and customized to your individual needs.\nHospital and clinic staff receive fewer and at the same time more targeted alarm messages which empowers them to immediately tell vital from uncritical messages and to respond adequately right away. Use the easy DAKSmed browser-based user interface to select and assign the different patient care services, beds and alarms and support your individual hospital workflow in an optimum way.\nReceive targeted alarm messages and respond effectively\nAssign e.g. specific types of alarms or alarms from specific patient beds in a targeted way to the right nurses and fully mapped to the individual shifts.\nAlso, whenever a nurse is unable to take an alarm, e.g. because he/she is already attending to another patient, the DAKSmed user interface on the handset helps to quickly forward the alarm message to other colleagues and to make sure that no important alarm is ever delayed (functions depending on device type). In addition, the mobile handsets can be used to call for help straight away, especially in difficult situations when every second counts.\nDAKSmed distributes alarms from patient monitors specifically to the DAKScommunicator terminals of assigned caregivers who can thus move freely and still receive detailed alarms from their patients. This allows them to monitor multiple patients simultaneously without having to be in their immediate vicinity.\nWith DAKScommunicator, caregivers can detect various alarms, assess the need for action, and respond or forward tasks accordingly. In doing so, DAKScommunicator supports an uninterrupted workflow by being worn on the body and being particularly easy and intuitive to use without having to be held in the hand.\nOverall, caregivers can work more attentively, with greater focus and confidence.\nDAKScommunicator is optimized for mobile workflows with audio, messaging and voice communication, and meets enterprise requirements for usability, availability, robustness and sensitive data handling.", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

{"id": "930", "text": "The conversation surrounding the “gay voice” has been shadowed and loaded. Shadowed by the specter of homosexual self-loathing and stereotypes, and loaded with gender expectations and biases. The idea of the gay voice is that if you close your eyes, and you can tell if a male is gay or straight just by listening to them. It’s the aural aspect to the gaydar. All the way back in 2000, David Sedaris wrote about the speech impediment classes he took in elementary school to rid him of his lisp. Waggishly, he quipped that the class was actually attended by Future Gay Boys of America.\nSedaris was filling in an anecdote with truthy observations, and not by any means making a documentary. By creating a personal account of his experience with the gay voice, he’s permitted to put himself in the story. Unfortunately, David Thorpe was unable to remove himself in the documentary Do I Sound Gay? in which he struggles with his status as a single gay man in his 40s, and uses that to explore his gay voice, the phenomenon of the gay voice, and why the gay voice matters. He bounces around from topic to topic, never dwelling long enough on anything to let that point make a definitive statement. Is it about misogyny? Is it because the gay voice has a feminine structure? Is it condemned because gay men became gay because we like masculine identifiers? Is it picked up as a social habit; a gay code of sorts?\nWe never get answers to these because Thorpe interjects himself all over the map. At several points throughout the movie, Thorpe edits in classic films that are supposed to have gay-coded characters. He lets the characters talk for a line or two, then proceeds to finish their lines in a voiceover. This style is representative of the movie, where he gets experts in gay culture to speak their opinions, then proceeds to whine right over it and interject his own voice lessons in how to speak more hetero. There are gold bricks of good information, but they’ve been paved over by Thorpe’s insecurities, and that’s a shame.\nOne of the prominent festival rules is “Sometimes the movie you see is the movie you can make it to.” That is, sometimes you have no idea what you’re watching, but you’ll watch it anyways because it is near the last movie, and starts at a time that doesn’t impede anything else. Sometimes you’ll end up with genius. Other times, you’ll end up with crap. My decision to watch Pioneer Heroes ended with the latter, but I’m not even entirely sure about that.\nNatalya Kudryashova’s first feature film is nothing but ambitious. It’s a non-linear film with a broken timeline, flipping between present day (2015) and 1987. It also follows three different characters along both timelines. Yes, there are six different stories happening at once. The 1987 timeline follows three children under the Soviet Union striving to be Pioneer Heroes, a group of scouts who are actually experiments in ultra-patriotic Lenin-worshipping brainwashing. One boy refuses to be a lead singer in a choir, desiring to clack his tongue like everybody else. One girl stresses because her grandfather is brewing alcohol, and it is forbidden. Another girl…blech.\nWhatever Kudryashova is trying to say is lost in translation. I couldn’t tell if she was criticizing the naivete of the children and the program, or if she was praising its patriotism. I couldn’t tell if she was saying that the brainwashing messed up their adult lives, of if their adult lives were messed up because they strayed away from the teachings of Lenin. Is it better to be conservative and listen to the leaders? That’s what I got from the movie, but others didn’t react the same way, though they were similarly confused. Though, maybe the confusion in ultra-liberal Seattle was because we were rejecting the ultra-conservative pro-Soviet Union message in the film.\nThursday’s world premiere of Aaron Hann and Mario Miscione’s Circle was a phenomenal hit that retained its audience through a significant technical glitch. The glitch, which happened about an hour through the movie, saw the various audio tracks go off sync, and suddenly we were hearing dialogue in three separate times in three separate locations creating a weird psychotic break for about 3-5 minutes, after which they stopped the movie, had to fix the problem, and restarted it. Only 2 people walked out. That’s a real film at work.\nCircle plays with tropes familiar to anybody who has been watching indie science fiction for the past two decades. 50 people wake up in a room standing on individual red circles laid out in a patterned ring surrounding a black dome. If they step out of their circles, they’re killed and dragged off the board. Every two minutes, the black dome zaps a person and they are dragged out of the room. Eventually, the people figure out that they can vote on the next to die via a pattern in the floor, but each person can only see the vote that they themselves are casting. Soon enough, it’s trying to figure out who everybody is, and who deserves to live and die.\nThe question isn’t “does a life matter?” but “how do you value a life?” Hann and Miscione fill the circle with 50 identifiably American characters arguing over identifiably American values. The gimmick of a death every 2 minutes keeps Circle moving at a rapid, almost breathless, pace. Just as you’re getting comfortable in a conversation, suddenly somebody dies. The screenplay is clever and knowing, even if it feels a bit rushed and cliched at times. Hann and Miscione aren’t here to make judgments on their characters, but have filled them with the observations they’ve seen in their experiences. But, more than the politics, Circle is just a hell of a lot of fun.\nThe Seattle International Film Festival is known for its mix of under the radar films and high profile indies. On the third Friday of the festival, they showed the high profile Mister Holmes, the new pairing of director Bill Condon and Ian McKellan. They last worked together on Gods and Monsters, the indie darling about the end of James Whale’s life. This time around, they’re focusing on the end of Sherlock Holmes’ life, and casting his last case in a different light.\nBased on Mitch Cullin’s A Slight Trick of the Mind, Mister Holmes finds Holmes returning home from a trip to Japan where he was trying to buy an oil to help him with his loss of memory (read: Alzheimer’s Disease). In his country mansion, he’s at odds with his housemaid while befriending her son. Holmes spends his time rewriting his final story, a chintzy remake of Vertigo and getting the son to be his editor. And, he also retells his travels to Japan.\nIf there’s something deep, I’m not sure what it is. Mister Holmes has three different timelines in just 105 minutes, not having enough time to properly dive into any of them. Perhaps the greatest mystery of all is that there is no mystery. There is, instead, a dedication to humanity and love in the golden years of fading memory and abilities. But, even that is poorly done and not well constructed. One must resort to the simple pleasures of Ian McKellan starring as Sherlock Holmes (and possibly Laura Linney as his housemaid).\nWith a much lower profile is the PBS-produced documentary The Black Panthers: Vanguard of the Revolution, about the rise and fall of the Black Panthers. For those that don’t know, the Black Panthers were a national group of black people who wanted to better their own community through beneficial programs and displays of power. The iconic image of the Black Panther is the black man in a leather jacket and hat armed with large guns defending their right to bear arms. But, they also were developing programs to rid themselves of the class structure that disempowered the black community through poverty and lack of education. One such program was free breakfasts for school children in poverty-stricken neighborhoods.\nVanguard is an average doc about an important subject. Stanley Nelson can’t wrangle the subject into a form that expands beyond the PBS origins, and, subsequently, it lacks the passion that would be fitting of the Black Panthers. One doesn’t make a 10-point program without being passionate and angry about the situation surrounding you. Instead of editing with passion, Nelson has talking heads saying that the anger was in the streets. Nelson’s generic tone doesn’t match the radical subject matter; but is that to make it more palatable to the PBS audience? Whatever it is, it suffers.\nStill, the SIFF presentation of Vanguard on Friday night was one to remember. To have a follow-up discussion of subject matter in the film, SIFF conducted a Q&A with Ericka Huggins, a leader in the Black Panthers, and subsequent activist. Huggins is, perhaps, one of the wisest people that I have ever had the fortune to listen to. Her Q&A was everything I have ever wanted to hear in a leader without having ever heard it before.\nThe audience was filled with a variety of walks of life. In one corner there was a group of youthful black activists who were fighting against the building of a new juvenile detention center in the middle of a black-prominent neighborhood. They also taught an extra school that focused on black and activist history. Standing on the stairs during the Q&A was a white police officer. Sons of black panthers were behind me. Well-meaning liberal white people were around my seat.\nMs. Huggins answered a few questions, but with these wise poetic answers that would drift from topic to topic, but always coming back to the core of the question. When asked about the industrial prison complex, she first started talking about the various socioeconomic factors that lead people to commit acts that would guide them to the path of prison. Even as she condemned prison, she was pointing out the problems that increased the populations of prison. She commented on how the current class system is structured off the plantation, where the moneyed interests used the police as ranch hands to control the uprisings of the slaves/peasants/working class. She commented on the educations system and its funding, and the limitations that come with high cost higher education. Through it all, Ms. Huggins spoke in a cool, calm, and collected manner that spoke to her decades of wisdom without coming from a place of elite authority. This will remain a cherished moment where the Q&A was so full of wisdom and love.\nNext Entry: Stories, investigations, and the only film (so far) that I cannot figure out how to rate.", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}

{"id": "933", "text": "Our take on Chi’s very fast-styling iron with its unique plates infused with volcanic lava\nAvailable sizes: 1”,1.5”\nFor which hair type: thick hai̇r, medium to long hair\nWhat we like: durable, fast results\nWhat we don’t like: too hot for fine hair, no temperature control\nChi’s original lava ceramic Flat Iron brings a simple yet very effective styling experience. If you’re on a hunt for a very fast flat iron that brings bone-straight results, that has highly durable material, Chi may be the right choice for you. Its most unique quality that stands out is its volcanic lava-infused plates that makes this tool very long-lasting as well as bringing frizz-free results. Don’t get us wrong; this tool is far from being perfect. It doesn’t have temperature control and it reaches to temperatures up to 395F. This means there’s no gentle option for fine hair and this tool certainly is not suitable for fragile strands. It also doesn’t have auto shot off which is a very handy feature that makes flat irons safe against fire. But it still is a luxury tool with best quality material, and with $100, we think it’s worth the price. Below we share our experiences with “Chi Original Lava Ceramic Hair Styling Iron”. If you’re curious about the competition, check out the article about best flat irons for black hair.\nTable Of Contents\n- Shape And Size\n- Heat And Variable Settings\n- Material And Performance\n- Price And Guarantee\nSize of a flat iron is one of the most important aspects to consider before making a healthy decision. Chi Lava Ceramic Flat iron gives you two options to choose from. The smaller 1” one is considered the medium sized and it fits almost all hair types. It’s slim enough to come closer to the roots for shorter hair types and large enough to cover enough area at one pass for longer types. But if your hair is very short, it’s wise to consider an even slimmer option such as FHI Platform Signature Pro Styler with a plates size of 0.5”, half of Chi’s plates. The 1.5” option is for the longer and thicker hair types and for the ones that want an even faster styling experience.\nIt has an 3.55” plate length and is the shortest size on our list. This info may matter if you have long hair and want to style your strands with the as least passes as possible. There are much longer plates in the market such as Conair Double Ceramic with 4.73”, and it offers even a 2” plate width option.\nIt has multi-directional floating plates which is a great quality that ensures contact between hair and plates at all times.\nThis tool is convenient for curling hair as it has rounded-edged plates for less creasing.\nChi Original Lava Ceramic is one of the shortest flat irons on our list with only 10.25”. This can be beneficial if you travel with your flat iron and want a compact tool.\nVariable heat setting is a very important feature that allows you to choose the perfect temperature for your strands without damaging them and for optimal results. Chi Original Lava Ceramic Flat Iron is the only tool on our list that doesn’t have temperature control. It has a maximum temperature of 395F, and there’s no way to adjust it to make it more or less. This temperature is convenient for thick hair types that need high levels of heat to tame. But if you have fine and fragile hair, you will need temperatures much lower than that. It certainly is not the right tool for fine hair and if that’s the case, there are many options on our list that provide a very gentle session, such as Tymo Sway that goes as low as 140F.\nHeat of its handle is maximum 80F and is safe to touch. But its cool tip(174F) and back of its plates(177F) both get too hot and should be used with heat protectant glove if you want to touch these areas.\nThis tool doesn’t have any audible warning when it reaches its maximum temperature, It doesn’t even have auto shot off to make it fire safe. These features are important if you’re a beginner and don’t know how to use the tool, but doesn’t really matter for experienced home stylists.\nThis tool has ceramic plates which are infused with volcanic lava. First of all, ceramic is known for its gentle styling capacities and it’s much less likely to burn your hair than titanium. It may not be the fastest material, but it’s much more suitable for daily use as well as for beginners. Ceramic is a very common material when it comes to flat irons. Volcanic Lava, on the other hand, is quite unique and this tool is the only flat iron on our list with this material. The quality it brings is mostly about how durable it makes the plates, as well as releasing negative ions for frizz-free results. As much as ceramic is usually a gentle option, in this particular case, this flat iron is still considered a harsh one. Its high and non-adjustable temperature makes this flat iron not suitable for fine hair and if you need a gentle flat iron, you will need another brand such as Bioionic Goldpro Flat iron with ceramic plates as well as 170F minimum heat.\nIf there is one thing that stands out in Chi hair tools, it’s their material quality. Chi Original Lava Ceramic Hairstyling Iron doesn’t disappoint and it’s one of the most durable products on our list. The volcanic lava coating also helps in this matter. It’s very sturdy to hold and it justifies its cost of $100. We can say that it’s a luxury product with this material quality but as far as luxury tools go, it’s on the cheaper side of the spectrum.\nChi Original Lava Ceramic Hair Styling Iron weighs 9oz and is considered a medium-weight flat iron. It wouldn’t bother most but if you will use your flat iron for long periods of time and would really love to avoid arm fatigue, we recommend an even lighter tool such as Conair Tourmaline Ceramic Flat Iron with only 7.9oz.\nDiameter of its handle is average-sized with 4.5” and fits most hands.\nIts swivel cord is 11ft long which is a very generous size and longer than most. It may come handy in case your plug is not right next you mirror.\nIt has dual voltage so that you can use it anywhere in the world, and considering is weight and size, this is a quite compact tool that is travel-friendly.\nIt doesn’t have digital display nor temperature control which is a big downside. These are very useful features and if you are not very used to using a flat iron, you may want to consider another brand with these qualities. We can’t really say that it’s the most ergonomic tool without these features as it makes things harder for most.\nChi Original Lava Ceramic, with $100, is a middle priced tool. Chi products are usually considered luxury tools and even though it has its down sides, with this material quality, we can say that it’s definitely value for money. It comes with a 2 year guarantee which is the average number in the market. You can opt for a more luxury tool that has digital display and temperature control, but it will cost much more. A great example would be Bioionic 10X Styling Iron that has everything that a luxury tool has to offer, but costs $240.\nAs we mentioned above, Chi Original Lava Ceramic Hairstyling Iron is not the gentlest tool on our list and certainly not suitable for fine hair. Fortunately, Chi offers a solution to this issue with its Chi Original Digital Ceramic Hairstyling Iron. It comes with ceramic plates which is the gentlest material, the biggest difference is that it has a minimum setting of 180F which is perfect for delicate strands.\nAs much as $100 is considered average in the market, we know that not everyone has the budget to spend this much on a flat iron. When we look at more affordable options with similar qualities with Chi, we come across Conair Double Ceramic Flat Iron. It also has ceramic plates and does a decent job taming thick and unruly strands, and it costs only $29.", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

{"id": "936", "text": "Philip Aron “Phil” Edwards, runner, physician (born 23 September 1907 in Georgetown, British Guiana [now Guyana]; died 6 September 1971 in Montréal, QC). Nicknamed the “Man of Bronze,” middle distance runner Phil Edwards won five bronze medals at three Olympic Games in the 4x400m relay (1928 and 1932), 800m (1932 and 1936) and 1,500m (1932). He was the most decorated Canadian Olympian until 2002, when speed skater Marc Gagnon won his fifth medal, tying Edwards’s record. In 1936, Edwards became the first recipient of the Lou Marsh Trophy as top athlete in the country. A graduate of McGill University medical school and star of the university’s track team, Edwards later became a leading expert in tropical diseases.\nEarly Life and Education\nPhil Edwards was born in Georgetown, British Guiana, to a family of 13 children. His father was a magistrate, and the family was part of the Black elite in the British colony. Edwards attended the prestigious Queen’s College in Georgetown and, at age 16, dominated track events at the school. After graduating, he left British Guiana and moved to the United States, enrolling at New York University (NYU), where elder brother “King” was already a student athlete. Edwards’ parents and several of his siblings also emigrated to New York, where they founded a law and real estate firm in Harlem (one of his sisters became the first Black female lawyer in New York state). Under the guidance of NYU coach Emil Von Elling, Edwards steadily improved as a runner, particularly in 880-yard races (roughly equivalent to 800 m). In the summer of 1927, for example, he narrowly missed winning the US national title in the 880-yard event.\nDespite his obvious talent, Edwards could not compete for a spot on the US Olympic team as he wasn’t a citizen and, at the time, his home country, British Guiana, did not have an Olympic team. However, as a British subject, Edwards was eligible to compete for another country within the empire. In 1927, Melville Marks “Bobby” Robinson invited him to join the Canadian team for the 1928 Olympic Games in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. (Robinson, who was manager of the track and field team, had also helped found the Hamilton Olympic Club and would later bring the first British Empire Games to Hamilton, Ontario, in 1930.) In late June 1928, Edwards competed at the Canadian Olympic trials in Hamilton, winning the national title in the 800m and qualifying for the Games. At the Amsterdam Games, he placed fourth in the 800m and won a bronze medal as a member of the 4X400m relay team.\nAfter the 1928 Games, Edwards returned to NYU to complete his studies, but continued his association with the Hamilton Olympic Club. In 1929, he travelled between the United States and Canada, competing in track meets in both countries. In August, for example, The Globe reported that he had starred at an athletic competition held in Ottawa:\nThe Central Canada exhibition came to a close yesterday with the holding of a mammoth sports program, featured by the appearance of Canada’s great half-miler, Phil Edwards. The member of last year’s Canadian Olympic team, running in the colors of the Hamilton Olympic Club, was the stellar performer in a program which was studded with keen competition and brilliant performances by the best of Ontario’s schoolboy athletes. The dusky flier had no strong competition, but he gave an impressive and pleasing display to capture both the 880-yard senior run and the one-mile run.\nDid you know?\nThe Globe newspaper referred to Phil Edwards as the “dusky knight of the cinder paths,” while a 1932 article in the Montreal Gazette referred to him as “Dusky Phil.” The term “dusky” means “dark,” and was commonly used to refer to people with darker complexions, particularly those of African ancestry.\nEdwards continued to make headlines in the Globe, including reports about his personal life (“Phil Edwards to Marry,” 7 October 1929) and his academic plans following graduation from NYU in May 1930 (“Phil Edwards Plans to Attend Cambridge,” 2 May 1930).\nMcGill University Star Athlete\nDespite his earlier plans to attend Cambridge law school, Edwards eventually decided to apply to medical school and, in 1931, enrolled in first-year medicine at McGill University. In June 1931, the Globe informed its readers of the news, remarking “the coming of the stellar middle-distance runner boosts McGill chances in the forthcoming track events, for Edwards is recognized as superior to any Canadian runner at his distances.” He lived up to his reputation, leading the McGill track team to six consecutive championships from 1931 to 1936.\nThe “Man of Bronze” at the 1932 Games\nEdwards again competed for Canada at the 1932 Olympic Games in Los Angeles, California. During the 800m final, he set out at a blistering pace and led the race at the halfway point. However, at the final turn he was caught by Canadian teammate Alex Wilson and British runner Tom Hampson, both of whom broke the world record. Hampson won the race, with Wilson second, while Edwards hung on to take third.\nHe also won a bronze medal in the 1,500m, beating such favourites as American GlennCunningham and New Zealand runner John “Jack” Edward Lovelock. Edwards picked up a third bronze medal as part of the 4X400m relay team, along with Alex Wilson, James Ball and Raymond Lewis (the first Canadian-born Black man to win an Olympic medal).\nDid you know?\nPhil Edwards won 3 bronze medals at the 1932 Olympic Games in Los Angeles. In total, he would win 5 bronze medals at the Olympics from 1928 to 1936.\nThe 1936 Olympic Games in Berlin\nEdwards continued to train and race between the 1932 and 1936 Olympic Games, winning a number of titles, including a gold medal in the half mile at the 1934 British Empire Games in London (at the 1930 and 1934 British Empire Games, he was part of the Guianese rather than the Canadian team).\nA veteran competitor, Edwards was chosen captain of the Canadian track and field team for the 1936 Olympic Games in Berlin. Also on the team was Sam Richardson, a Black track and field athlete from Toronto. Many Canadians (and Americans) wanted to boycott the 1936 Olympic Games because of Nazi Germany’s treatment of Jews and its ideology of White supremacy. However, others felt that participation in the Olympics would be a more effective challenge to Nazi ideology. In addition to Edwards and Richardson, Jewish basketball star Irving \"Toots\" Meretsky competed at the Games as part of the Canadian Olympic team.\nEdwards won his fifth bronze medal at the 1936 Olympic Games when he was narrowly beaten by Italian runner Mario Lanzi for second place in the 800m final. He then placed a respectable fifth in the 1,500m.\nDid you know?\nJesse Owens, the African American track star, won four medals at the 1936 Games: in the 100m, 200m, 4X100m relay and the long jump. The success of Black athletes such as Owens and Edwards was cheered by Canadian and American reporters, but prompted Germany’s Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels to remark that, “White people should be ashamed of themselves.”\nIronically, Edwards himself experienced racial discrimination not in Germany, but in London, England, as the Canadian team prepared to return home. When the team checked into a hotel, they discovered that the staff wouldn’t allow Edwards to register as a guest. Outraged on behalf of their captain, the entire team decided to leave (according to some accounts, Edwards was eventually allowed to register at the hotel, while others suggest the team found alternate accommodations).\nLater that year, Edwards became the first recipient of the Lou Marsh Trophy, awarded to Canada’s top athlete, as well as the Lionel Conacher Award for best male athlete.\nEdwards graduated from McGill University’s medical school in 1936. Although many assumed he would return to British Guiana to practise medicine, he instead accepted a three-year position at the General Hospital in Barbados as resident house surgeon. During the Second World War, Edwards served with the Canadian Army as a captain and was stationed in British Columbia, near the Pacific theatre. After the war he returned to McGill, earning a graduate medical diploma in tropical diseases in 1945. He remained in Montréal, eventually becoming head of the parasitology department at the Royal Victoria Hospital. An acknowledged expert in tropical diseases, tuberculosis and chest diseases, he was also a consultant for the Canadian government.\nDid you know?\nAlthough Phil Edwards is sometimes identified as the first Black graduate of McGill University’s medical school, this is incorrect. Charles Lightfoot Roman, for example, graduated from McGill’s medical school in 1919.\nEdwards died on 6 September 1971—about two weeks before his 64th birthday—after a six-month illness. According to his obituary in the Globe and Mail, he had previously had surgery for cancer, but had later been “confined because of a heart ailment.” Edwards left behind wife Dianne and their three daughters.\nEdwards was Canada’s most decorated Olympian for about 70 years. Before the 1932 Olympic Summer Games in Los Angeles, a number of Canadian athletes (George Orton, Robert Kerr, Percy Williams, Fanny Rosenfeld and Ethel Smith) had each won a total of two Olympic medals. When Edwards took three bronze medals at the 1932 Games alone, he entered the record books. His career total of five Olympic medals would not be met until Marc Gagnon won his fifth speed skating medal in 2002.\nThe most significant of his medals is probably his last: the bronze he won in the 800m at the 1936 Games in Berlin. There, Edwards, like American track star Jesse Owens, disproved the lie of Aryan supremacy spouted by the Nazi regime. Following his death in 1971, the Globe and Mail remarked that his “bronze medal in the 800-meter run and his fifth place in the 1,500-meter race in Berlin in 1936 not only added to Canada’s totals, but added Dr. Edwards to the ranks of black athletes from many countries who shot holes in Hitler’s pure Aryan track army on its home grounds.”\nRacial discrimination was and would remain a problem in Canada. During this period, Black Canadians were effectively segregated in many public spaces, Jewish Canadians faced widespread social, professional and economic discrimination, and Chinese people were banned from immigrating to the country. However, Edwards was much loved and admired, by his teammates and the public. A five-time Olympic medallist and Olympic team captain, he became a popular figure in Canada, with newspapers styling him the “dusky knight of the cinder paths.” The first recipient of the Lou Marsh Award for best athlete in the country, Edwards became a hero to many Canadians.\nDid You Know?\nAt the time, races were run on cinder tracks — these were constructed from a variety of materials, including small rocks and coal ash. The 1964 Olympic Games in Tokyo were the last to use cinder running tracks. All subsequent Games and major international competitions have used synthetic running surfaces. As synthetic tracks provide a superior running surface, it can be misleading to compare the times of modern runners to those from earlier eras.\nHonours and Awards", "scores": {"score": 3, "score_transform_1": 5, "score_transform_2": 5, "score_transform_3": 0}}
{"id": "937", "text": "Many students have physical or learning disabilities that make it difficult for them to learn through traditional styles of instruction. To help these students succeed, school systems offer an altered curriculum and/or instructional approach. These changes are called modifications, adaptations or accommodations.\nThere are no set definitions for the terms modification, adaptation and accommodation. As a result, these terms often get used imprecisely and interchangeably. Generally, modifications and adaptations refer to individualized curriculum changes that reduce the difficulty and size of a student's workload. Accommodations, however, usually refer to tools and techniques that help students keep up with a standard workload identical to that of their peers. In other words, modifications and adaptations change what a student is expected to learn while accommodations change how a student learns.\nSpecial needs populations include students with learning disabilities, ADHD, autism, emotional disturbances, low IQ, blindness, deafness and mobility limitations. For academic subjects, students with only physical limitations will usually receive accommodations, not modifications or adaptations; for gym class, however, they may follow a modified or adapted curriculum. Students with ADHD who have a high IQ may also need only a few accommodations to succeed; more severe cases may warrant a modified or adapted curriculum. The same is true for children with autism and learning disabilities. Gifted children and children who speak a language other than English are also considered part of the special needs population; they may also receive modifications or accommodations.\nStudents receiving modifications or adaptations are usually given less input; this means they receive less material to memorize or learn, and their assignments are shorter and easier than those given to the rest of the class. Modifications can also apply to students' output. They will be expected to recall or generate fewer details, and they may not be required to participate at the same level as their peers. Students requiring a modified or adapted curriculum have their own individual goals, and they take special modified versions of standardized tests.\nOften students with modified or adapted curricula also receive accommodations. Accommodations for input include sign language interpreters, books in Braille and audio-taped books. Output accommodations include allowing a student to take an oral test instead of a written test. Other accommodations include allowing the use of calculators, providing graphic organizers and giving a student extra time to complete an assignment. If accommodations allow a child to succeed, he will not need a modified or adapted curriculum.\nModified or adapted curricula allow students with special needs to continue learning at a pace they can keep up with. They also allow them to take part in the social aspects of student life. A modified physical education curriculum may make it possible to expect a student with physical disabilities to participate in an athletic activity, and the learning and fun that goes with it.\nLinda Basilicato has been writing food and lifestyle articles since 2005 for newspapers and online publications such as eHow.com.

{"id": "938", "text": "Sunday's Golden Globes: They were fast-moving and improbable, sort of like The Hangover. Also? There were more snubs than you could shake your DNA-sharing braid at. But, like every year, famous people came out to show us that they're just like our families: a bit more fun after three drinks.\nHere is a full list of the winners that were.\nTo read the comments in chronological order, click here.\nClick the Image to View Our Gallery of the Red Carpet at This Year's Golden Globes\n10:57—Julia Roberts came out to drag the curtain down on this party, with her maharajah ruby necklace. (It symbolizes \"wealth,\" or \"spirituality\" or something.) And the win of the night? She seems a little disappointed. And she should be. Quentin Tarantino looks cranky. Kathryn Bigelow certainly should be cranky. Daniel Day-Lewis? Definitely sorta disturbed by Avatar.\nI do think that what will happen is that there will be a fight, at some point, regarding animated movies, and CGI movies, and old-fashioned movies without motion capture. James Cameron's attempt to be inclusive--\"pat yourselves on the back!\"--is not playing in this crowd, because this is a bit \"us v. them\" at this point. There are clearly some, even in this crowd, who think that the likes of Avatar is just capitalism and not so much a chance for actors to ply their craft. (Don't tell that to Sam Worthington though.)\nSo: Golden Globes, 2028. Will it have a 3-D-only Best Picture category? Will it have a no-CGI Best Picture category? Will the finance people agree with the art crowd that Tarantino & Bigelow are making substantially different categories of filmed entertainment from Bigelow's ex-husband?\nIn other news, Christian Slater has already hit the afterparty. And I think it's time to join him. Here's to 2010: maybe a better year in movies.\n10:56—Best motion picture, drama, goes to Avatar.\n10:48—Jeff Bridges did, in fact, grow up in Westwood, so it is improbable that he has that folksy, earnest, backwoods accent. However! His folksy, earnest, backwoods face? He earned that, through living. It is terrific: the deep wrinkles, the double dimples. He got those by living large. We are now image-Googling for pictures of his stand-in, whom he thanked. Has his stand-in lived as hard and as terrifically? Only his face can tell the story of so many decades, lived so close to the edge.\n10:47—Best actor in a drama goes to Jeff Bridges.\n10:41—Remember when Robert Downey Jr. was circling the drain? All strung out and missing and nearly donezo? That was a near miss. What would we have done without him? He became the most delightful man around.\n10:40—Robert Downey Jr. wins best actor in a comedy or musical.\n10:37—Sandy Bullock Strikes Back! The Revenge of the Bullock! Romancing the Bullock! Sandy Bullock 2: Electric Bugaloo! America's Old Sweetheart is Once Again America's New Sweetheart! And you know, I'm not sad to have her back. (Just remember Miss Congeniality. Good times, those were.)\n10:36—Sandra Bullock wins best actress in a drama for The Blind Side.\n10:33—It's amazing that the governor of California isn't being pelted with glasses and rotten fruit. Hello, the state is bankrupt and here we all are, while people are probably looting five blocks away. Instead everyone there is laughing and applauding. And this is why they hate liberal Hollywood.\n10:29—You know, Best Comedy or Musical as a category was wide-open, and that is a true reflection of the problems of 2009. Movies and comedies were troubled. This category is full of small, or troubled, or iffy, or niche movies. So why not The Hangover? At least it made money! People saw the holy heck outta that movie. You know why? Because it was oh-so- raunchy and the kids today like the risque, and the dirty language and the sexual situations. (This is why in 20 years there will be an award-sweeping movie that stars a bunch of people's butts. But that's OK!)\n10:19— Glee wins for best TV series, comedy or musical.\n10:18—My party has gotten as drunk as the audience at the Hilton, and this means that they were underwhelmed by James Cameron's win for best director but a little bit excited that he can still remember his made-up Na'avi language, which you know what? There are not Internet Usenet groups devoted to Na'avi. The kids are not blogging in Na'avi. It is not Klingon. It's not really all the rage at all!\n10:15—James Cameron wins best director for Avatar.\n10:14—It's weird that it feels TOO SOON for Mel Gibson drunk jokes. (I think Ricky Gervais got booed a little when he basically called Gibson a Drunky McDrunk? Or were they booing Gibson? Which!) I mean, everyone (that matters) in the room is Jewish! Have we all really gotten over that incident? I pretty much haven't!\n10:02—Da Vinci, Picasso, Beethoven... Scorsese! Do you think that might be true? Or is it completely improbable? Or will no one remember Beethoven maybe—like, in the year 2178, will Lady Gaga be more important? In any event. This Scorsese tribute is in fact an exceptional montage. The King of Comedy is really the greatest movie ever, ever, ever.\n9:52—This is a win everyone can get behind: Christoph Waltz! I mean, we all loved his work in Die Zürcher Verlobung... Kidding! We love it when a kooky and excellent fifty-something Austrian who actually knows how to act gets to hang out with famous people!\n9:51—Christoph Waltz wins best supporting actor in a movie for Inglourious Basterds.\n9:48—Chloe Sevigny wins best supporting actress in a TV series or movie for Big Love.\n9:41—Christina Hendricks! That is amazing. (Almost as amazing as Jon Hamm's beard.) She is a stunning woman. Do you think in 60 years she will be on this stage again, in the Sophia Loren role, and everyone will give her a standing ovation and cry?\n9:39— Mad Men won for best TV drama.\n9:37—I guess it is OK that Michael Haneke beat out Pedro Almodovar. But It is not OK that they cut to ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER during Haneke's speech just because they are both Austrian, that is just plain old racist.\n9:36—Michael Haneke's The White Ribbon wins best foreign film.\n9:33—It's amazing that the Sophia Loren appearance is the highlight of the evening. This suggests that there is a little bit of a lack of pizazz tonight? That no one quite knows what to do in the face of Haiti? The room here erupted: \"This outfit could be from the '80s you don't know!\" \"OMG what!\" \"Yay, love her glasses.\" \"When they go outside they become sunglasses!\" \"Do not make fun of Sophia Loren! You cannot make fun of Sophia Loren!\"\n9:27—Best comedy actor in a TV show goes to Alec Baldwin for 30 Rock. (And wasn't there to accept it.)\n9:24—Jason Reitman and Sheldon Turner win best screenplay for Up in the Air.\n9:23—Ricky Gervais' beard is getting thicker as the evening goes on, right? It's like some fast-motion Fantastic Mr. Fox animation.\n9:18—I'm going to say something! Maybe I am not supposed to say this? But... are there any other black people at this awards show besides the fine people at the Precious table? Oh, yes, hello Chiwetel Ejiofor! But... is that it? And can I get an Asian? (Related: What happened to Lucy Liu? Did Code Name: The Cleaner finally do her in? She was awesome.)\n9:15—Hey, now! Old New Drew Barrymore, come back! Remember that interlude of responsible adulthood between crazy behavior in front of David Letterman years ago and tonight's crazy Golden Globes speech? It was nice. We would like to turn back the clock to that again pretty please.\n9:14—For Grey Gardens, Drew Barrymore wins for best actress in a TV miniseries or movie.\n9:11—Kevin Bacon wins for best actor in a TV miniseries or movie for Taking Chance.\n9:05—A few important notes:\n- Jeanne Tripplehorn looked AMAZING in the background, behind Rachael Horovitz accepting the award for the fantastic Grey Gardens. It would be the greatest if she helmed a reboot of Catwoman.\n- You cannot call Meryl Streep \"greedy,\" Colin Farrell.\n- This is fantastic that Meryl Streep gets to give another speech. Take five minutes on YouTube and search Meryl Streep Acceptance Speech. There's quite a few, obviously! And they are all exquisite.\n- This Meryl Streep speech? Absolutely in her Top Five. It's like a hot bath of Meryl Streep. The tribute to her mother? And you know what? They do not turn the music on for Meryl Streep. You do not hush the Streep! The Streep will be show you how it is done and she is done at exactly the right moment.\n9:01—For best performance by an actress in a comedy, Meryl Streep won for Julie and Julia. (She was also nominated in the same category for It's Complicated.)\n8:55— Grey Gardens won for best miniseries or TV movie.\n8:48—Michael Giacchino wins for best score for Up\n8:47—One joke that never gets old is saying \"I see you\" to people, a la Avatar. It is the greatest, especially when they're mad at you. Like at the deli, when they're tired of waiting for you to find change. \"I SEE YOU.\"\n8:46—\"The Weary Kind\" from Crazy Heart wins best original song, motion picture.\n8:44—I'm sorry, I blacked out for a minute during Cher and Christina Aguilera? You can't just spring that on people like us (gays) in the audience! Listen, they both looked amazing but kind of insane—one who had the \"fake boob out\" cutaway dress, and the other who had some sort of postmodern semi-corset? I sort of lost my mind and I can't even recover, but they did look like some kind of astral projection from Planet Amazing Sexual Crisis.\n8:39—Did you know that The Good Wife has like 14 million or so viewers each episode, on average? A huge number of people watch this show! It is insanely popular. And Julianna thanked Les Moonves for keeping dramas on at 10 o'clock, zing Jeff Zucker. Should I be watching this? This is a slightly odd awards show.\nDexter and Tara are a very unlikely couple.\n8:36—Julianna Margulies wins for best actress in a television series drama for The Good Wife.\n8:34—Michael C. Hall wins for best actor in a television series drama.\n8:33—Neil Patrick Harris' shirt was perfect, right? It's blindingly white. And this is a hot category he's introducing--Hot Man In A Drama. It's impossible to have known who to have rooted for in this one! Jon Hamm's beard has been uprooting young women's feelings all over the Internet. (Just ask Twitter and Tumblr. Jon Hamm's beard is the biggest winner here tonight.)\n8:23—Tonight's theme is that pretty much everyone is having trouble above the forehead. I know that sounds mean, but we have HD now in America, and, we can see things we were never meant to see. Paul McCartney's hair dye is just off. But the guy from Up, is very hot in a really young Frankenstein way. He has great hair. And, apparently, two children, who he thanks. Aww.\n8:12—This awards show is going as fast as the American attention span! Toni Collette, beating out Tina Fey, is very nearly forced to admit that no one watches her very fine show. Her dress? Golden and A+. Her speech? Sweet and short. Took less time than Paul McCartney's umbrella took to pass on the red carpet.\n8:11—Because Mo'Nique wins for best supporting for Precious.\n8:10—The Haiti Issue was been disposed of without much fuss, by Nicole Kidman. This is both seemly and sort of disappointing. And yet we have our most fabulous moment of the evening, with Mo'Nique beating out Julianne Moore's enormous, multi-billion dollar earrings. This is going to be a strange new world when Mo'Nique is like stomping in and out of CAA and taking meetings with Brad Pitt's production company. Annnnnd she just regained all the status she sort of tossed away by being \"difficult\" and \"troublesome\" according to the blogs on the Internet!\n8:03—Tonight already has the charming feel of a very rich high-school reunion. It's cute! It looks swank, and doesn't have that overstuffed, enormous Oscar feel. It's small, and lewd, and drinky--and the loudmouth guy from math class is up at the podium.\nNewly invented Haiti ribbons everywhere and the world's most immense emeralds on Julianne Moore! My God. It's important to note just how shiny Ricky Gervais is. This is unacceptable. There are handy products made by Lancome for this purpose. In any event, Ricky Gervais is sort of killing. With his pint in hand.\n7:57—Don't you love how it's a crisis when it rains a little in Los Angeles? \"Good luck, STAY DRY!\" has been the way to say goodbye from the red carpet folks.\nIn other news, the guy who plays the stupid guy on True Blood... doesn't sound all that smart in real life. Who would have thought.\nAlso, Ryan Seacrest is head and shoulders above Billy Bush, in terms of \"skills\" (at least on the red carpet). Also Tina Fey got her outfit from Beetlejuice cast-offs.\nAnd the JETS WON! WHOO!", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}
{"id": "939", "text": "Sign up for smart news, insights, and analysis on the biggest financial stories of the day.\nIn the 1990 movie “Total Recall,” an exasperated Arnold Schwarzenegger had to commandeer a Johnny Cab from an annoyingly incompetent automaton driver to make his getaway. Uber is hoping passenger-robot relations have evolved since then.\nTwo years after selling its autonomous division, Uber is driving full speed into the robotaxi business yet again. On Thursday, the rideshare pioneer inked a 10-year deal with Motional, a driverless vehicle joint venture between Hyundai and Aptive. Success is by no means automatic.\nI’m Not an Ambiturner\nThe automotive industry — rideshare companies in particular — is obsessed with driverless tech. Uber co-founder and two-star CEO Travis Kalanick put it simply in a 2014 interview with The Verge: “When there’s no other dude in the car, the cost of taking an Uber anywhere becomes cheaper than owning a vehicle.” Fortune Business Insights projects the autonomous car market could reach $11 billion by the end of this decade.\nBut chasing the dream has led the companies down a pot-marked road with little to show for it. Carmakers poured more than $100 billion into robocar R&D over the past decade, according to a McKinsey report. Yet, driverless cars struggle in weather worse than partly cloudy. Even traffic cones and simple left turns have flustered robodrivers.\nUber’s partnership with Motional puts the company back in the game while outsourcing the more pesky tech problems to a third party:\n- Uber launched an autonomous driving unit, Uber ATG, in 2015, only to find that meeting its ambitious goals proved too costly. The company — which never touched profitability until late last year — burned over $20 million a month in autonomous R&D and suffered a PR nightmare when one of its test cars killed a pedestrian; the unit was sold off to Aurora in December 2020.\n- Uber and Motional promised to have robotaxis ferrying people and delivering food orders by the end of the year, rolling out first in multiple yet-to-be-named US markets. They claimed the driverless cars would “ultimately lead to reduced wait times and lower fares,” combining Motional’s driverless tech with Uber’s treasure chest of passenger behavior and city-mapping data.\nDown the road: Uber is hardly the only one betting big on self-driving cars. Lyft and Motional have been servicing free robotaxis in Las Vegas for years, and just last week Uber’s chief competitor teamed up with the Ford-backed Argo AI to launch a similar program in Miami and Austin. GM-subsidiary Cruise is operating in San Francisco with plans to hit Austin and Phoenix, which is already populated by Google’s Waymo, by year’s end. Let’s hope we don’t find out the hard way if Johnny Cab’s driving has gotten any better.", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}

It’s an image type ideally suited for simple, clean designs like logos, website graphics, and, of course, laser cutting machines. Put simply, an SVG file is a kind of digital graphic that is super easy for your cutting machine to read and interpret, even when you're working with lots of different layers.\nYes, they can be made smaller or larger without affecting the quality of the image. You know when you zoom in too far on a photo and it gets fuzzy and pixelated? That doesn't happen with an SVG file. So if you want to use the same design for your coffee cup and your new laptop decal, you can easily change the size of the image to fit and your lines will come out nice and sharp both times.\nYes, SVG cut files allow you to include multiple layers in a single image without confusing your cutting software. That means that the graphic you see on the computer screen looks exactly how the final project will look. There is no need to create separate files for each layer and keep track of how they fit together. This is extremely helpful for designing complex cutting patterns and will save you a lot of time and planning.\nWhen you put a regular PNG image file into your cutting machine program, the computer can only see the outline of the image. This works fine if you want to cut out one solid shape. For more complicated projects with many different layers and varying levels of intricacy, SVG cut files are the way to go. All of the layers are coded into the one file, and your machine will be able to tell exactly where to cut for each section.\nDifferent cutting machines will use different programs, but most (if not all) will take SVG cut files. All of the designs on The Digital Files site are compatible with any cutting machine and laser machine programs that uses SVG cut files.", "scores": {"score": 3, "score_transform_1": 5, "score_transform_2": 5, "score_transform_3": 0}}
{"id": "943", "text": "Electrification is having profound impacts on the automotive industry. Electric aircraft may have a similar impact on the aerospace sector.\nAttracted by the low weight and cost of electric motors compared with gas turbine jet engines, and particularly by their near-silent operation and potential for zero emissions, the civil aviation sector is showing increasing interest in using electricity to power future flight, at least over the relatively short distances that dominate city-to-city aviation.\nWhile jets are unassailable as the prime movers for intercontinental long-haul airliners — nobody’s suggesting that electric aircraft could transport passengers from Europe to Asia, across the Atlantic or even between the East and West coasts of the US — the short-haul routes between both European and US cities, currently plied mostly by twin-engined single-aisle aircraft, are the targets for a new generation of radically different aircraft whose development is being fostered by the aerospace majors. These machines could take the sector into areas of science and technology very different from those it is used to.\nOf the two biggest players in civil aviation, Airbus is taking the more active role in this initiative by developing its own aircraft, while Boeing has invested in a start-up company that is conducting the process. Airbus’s plans have undergone considerable change, however.\nThe last time The Engineer covered this subject in detail was in an interview with the then-chief technology officer of Airbus, Jean Botti, in late 2015. Electric aircraft were a major focus of Botti’s tenure as CTO but he left the company in April 2016. His successor, while still attaching considerable importance to the project, has proved to have different ideas about how it should be conducted.\nPaul Eremenko joined Airbus in 2015 to launch and run its Silicon Valley-based innovation offshoot, A3; he took over the CTO’s position in June 2016. An aeronautics and astronautics graduate, he has worked at DARPA — where he headed the office responsible for drones, satellites, robotics and X-planes — and at Motorola and Google, where he initiated development of modular, customisable smartphones. In a lecture at Purdue University in 2014, he stated that his career had been motivated partly by a desire to build a starship, and while at DARPA he was involved in a study to define an organisation that might meet such a goal.\nOn moving to Airbus, one of Eremenko’s first actions was to revamp the E-Fan electric aircraft project. The first E-Fan, a two-seater with two 30kW electric motors, flew in 2014, crossing the English Channel as a symbolic feat. Airbus’s original plan was to develop this light aircraft further: a production version was slated for 2017 and marketed as a pilot trainer; and a four-seat version with a hybrid powertrain was due to fly in 2019, in which a kerosene-fuelled engine would act as a range extender, operating a generator to charge the batteries and boosting endurance to around three-and-a-half hours.\nA hybrid configuration – E-Fan Plus, with a 68hp (50kW) two-stroke combustion engine from German manufacturer Solo Aircraft Systems, capable of 30 minutes’ battery endurance and up to two hours 15 minutes in hybrid mode – was developed and flown in 2016, but subsequent plans for the electric aircraft project changed.\n“To put it simply, we decided that this plan was just not ambitious enough,” Glenn Llewellyn, Airbus general manager for electrification, told The Engineer.\nElectric aircraft development has continued under Siemens, which in 2016 formed a partnership with Airbus after co-sponsoring – but not providing equipment for – E-Fan. Siemens supplied the 50kg, 260kW motor for an Extra 330LE aerobatic aircraft that first took to the air in July 2016. An order of magnitude more powerful than the E-Fan, this aircraft spurred Airbus to abandon its roadmap of gradual power increases from the kW to the MW range, as Botti had envisaged, and instead look to progress directly to a 2MW demonstrator, as a stepping stone to a hybrid-drive aircraft that could match current single-aisle, short-haul aircraft in terms of range and passenger capacity, and operate from conventional airports. Such an aircraft would likely be another order of magnitude more powerful than the 2MW demonstrator, Llewellyn said.\n“We might be able to do that in a single step; we might not,” he told The Engineer. “We expect to encounter all sorts of challenges in developing the 2MW aircraft; we just don’t know what all of those might be yet. It’s those ‘unknown unknowns’ that make it difficult to predict how we’d take the step after that.”\nThe 2MW option has its own goals as a basis for urban aerial mobility vehicles. This sector – currently mostly speculative, of course – was one that Airbus had barely targeted before Eremenko’s appointment but, at the Geneva motor show in March this year, the company unveiled the result of a collaboration with Italian automotive development house Italdesign: a modular concept vehicle called Pop.Up. This consisted of a two-seater passenger capsule that could be linked to an electric ground module (essentially a four-wheeled chassis) or an octocopter air module.\nAirbus’s ambitions in this sector are likely to favour a larger-capacity vehicle, Llewellyn indicated, and not one that could operate in either road or air mode but one that would be able to take off and land from ‘vertiports’ within cities. “Electric propulsion is ideally suited to urban environments because it’s so quiet, which is important when you want to fly near occupied buildings and at low altitude. And, when you’re in pure electric mode, operating off batteries, you’re producing no emissions and are not affecting air quality,” he said.\nHowever, Llewellyn would not rule out such vehicles also having a hybrid capability. “It gives us greater flexibility and, of course, with a motor and generator complementing the electric system you can operate in a different mode. A gas turbine acting as a range extender wouldn’t have to handle all the varying loads you encounter during flight – the electric propulsion system would deal with those – so you can optimise its operation so that it runs at maximum efficiency.”\nSuch hybridisation could be with a hydrogen fuel cell or a gas turbine, or even a diesel engine, coupled to a generator, Llewellyn added. “Even with existing technologies, a hybrid could have significant range.”\nAnother factor in favour of hybrids crops up regularly with electric aircraft: much of the technology required to enable the type of aircraft that industry would like to fly is simply not yet advanced enough.\n“The power-to-weight ratios for battery technology are still a long way short of what is required,” Llewellyn said. “Current batteries would be far too heavy as the only source of energy to feasibly fly a large passenger aircraft. This is where hybrid solutions, even at low levels, can be of interest. That said, battery research perhaps has the most investment of any technology in the world right now, so we need to prepare ourselves for a future in which this is possible.”\nPop.Up is not Airbus’s only urban aerial mobility concept. At a presentation to media earlier this year, Eremenko described four other electric technology demonstrator projects: CityAirbus, a multi-propeller vehicle to carry up to four passengers, intended to be autonomous once regulations are in place for such aircraft, which is being developed by Airbus Helicopters and targeted for first flight by 2018; Skyways, a collaboration with the University of Singapore for delivery of small packages by drones, to be tested initially around the university; Vahana, a single-passenger self-piloted VTOL vehicle being developed by A3; and a less tangible A3 project, Voom, an on-demand shared helicopter booking app for megacity dwellers (with applications beyond only electric aircraft).\nOne thing that hasn’t changed from Botti’s vision is the design philosophy Airbus wants to apply to its larger electric aircraft. Rather than simply ‘bolting on’ engines to the wings or fuselage, it would integrate electric motors into the airframe at multiple points within aerodynamic housings.\n“One advantage that electric motors have over gas turbine engines is that it’s relatively cheap, in terms of both cost and weight, to add more of them,” Llewellyn said. “But using integration we can explore things like boundary layer ingestion, which could be another way to recover energy.”\nBoundary layer ingestion uses the air immediately around the aircraft to feed the fans that accelerate air to generate thrust; it reduces drag and, in theory, means that the engines do not have to work so hard, both of which would reduce fuel consumption (or, in the case of electric motors, their demand for electricity). However, it is not a simple matter because boundary layer airflow is distorted, so fans need to be designed to take account of this.\nAerospace technology is often a matter of trade-offs – for example, material strength\nis always balanced against lightness – and electrification is no exception. Heat management is often a sticking point, Llewellyn said, with more powerful motors’ components running hotter and therefore requiring more equipment to handle the heat load, so power output must be balanced against the amount of equipment that can be carried. This may also limit the use of another technology whose potential is attractive for electric aviation: superconductivity.\nThis is another area where technology has not developed to the point of usefulness. “Even the highest-temperature superconductors need to be cooled to about 70° above absolute zero,” Llewellyn said, “so, although you’d gain from the very efficient, low-loss transmission of energy in a superconducting system, you’d have to balance that against the extra mass of all that cooling equipment, plus you’d have to handle the heat extracted from the system.”\nDevelopment of higher-temperature superconductors could be a sector of fundamental research where the aerospace industry might want to inject funds, he speculated, although these might be limited to projects directly relevant to aviation.", "scores": {"score": 3, "score_transform_1": 5, "score_transform_2": 5, "score_transform_3": 0}}

{"id": "945", "text": "I’ve been testing a bunch of hookup sites over the last few years and some are so legit it’s insane. This one in particular here really works better than most. Now, one that doesn’t work all that great is Ultrahookup.com and this is all that you need to know below…Trust me, I’ve left nothing out and have literally covered it all right here!\nMy Report On UltraHookup.com\nTable of Contents\nOkay, so here’s the scoop on this website. UltraHookup.com is just another site owned by Nautell Capital Limited that is online for only one purpose, which is to rip people off. Like thousands of other fraudulent dating sites, this one too has many tricks up its sleeve through which it tries to fool the user.\nNot Free At All\nFor one, the site claims to be completely free for a beginning member. But, under the guise of validating the user’s age, they ask for your credit card information. Now, one has to wonder, why would anyone need a valid credit card’s info just to verify age?\nWell, that’s where the scam starts. Though they claim to not charge the account, members will notice almost immediately that their cards are indeed being charged.\nCross Sales Suck\nBut the charges are from porno websites that they haven’t even signed up for. It isn’t a stretch to assume that UltraHookup.com and these other sites have cut an underhanded deal, where the former brings in members and the latter extorts the money.\nFor a site that claims to have a free membership, a little investigation will reveal that the cost of being a ‘free’ member adds up to around $120 per month. Quite a hefty sum for something that comes gratis.\nFake Profile Accounts\nWhen a member finally gets into the site, they are greeted by thumbnails of beautiful local women looking to have a wild romp. But these profiles, as to be expected from a site that is pulling the above scam, are not real. Indeed, the pictures of the women themselves are fake.\nThese photographs have been lifted from other sites that do not, at least publically, have a connection with Ultrahookup. These fake accounts are created and maintained by employees of the company, and there are no real, interested women behind them at all.\nFake Instant Messages\nNot only that, but after logging in, you will also find yourself the lucky recipient of various emails and instant messages which come from these women. But, as already established, these women are fake, so where do these messages come from?\nWell, they don’t come from a human, for one. These posts are automatically generated by sophisticated computer software called bots, which are programmed to generate such messages and send them to new members to lure them in.\nThey Want Your Cash\nWhy go to all the trouble? Because, when a user receives such a text, it is only human for him to want to get in touch with the woman who has shown such interest in him. But the thing is, to do so, they would have to upgrade their membership, which will require them to open up their wallets. This is all in the pursuit of money and does not give any benefit to the user.\nObviously, since all these women do not exist and are not the ones behind the messages and emails, you will never be able to see them or get in touch with them. If you do choose to throw your money down the drain, you can be sure you’ll get more and more messages from the bots, since their main purpose is to string the person along and keep the money flowing. But there will be no real human interaction since the messages are fake.\nConclusion: UltraHookup.com Doesn’t Lead To Hookups\nThis is just another internet scam by Nautell Capital Limited, and you can rest assured that there are many others. The only thing one can do about it is to make sure you inform as many people as you can about the scam. Keep your eyes and ears open, since most of the workings of these frauds are admitted to in the Terms and Conditions pages of these sites.\nOther hookup sites that suck:", "scores": {"score": 0, "score_transform_1": 0, "score_transform_2": 0, "score_transform_3": 1}}

However after working in the commercial property industry in London for over 15 years, having two children, then COVID hit the world, and we suffered a huge family tragedy; I came out of the whole thing feeling exhausted, stressed, out of shape and not myself at all. I knew this was not going to be solved by a fad diet or quick fix. So post-lockdown I decided it was time for change, and I found an amazing longevity studio in Wimbledon where I started learning about biohacking, and things started to make sense again.\nI began listening to my body, going back to basics, making small incremental changes to improve my daily habits that would still fit in with my life, showing up consistently for myself and it quickly became my passion when I started seeing the amazing results for myself, and my family. My own transformation from being weak to being strong, from having bad skin to glowing skin, from being exhausted to having boundless energy, from being depressed to being full of positivity, made me realise that I wanted to share this concept with people and help them meet their optimal, so I retained in functional nutrition, and The Functional Edition was born!\nWhat is Functional Nutrition?\nSo what is functional living and functional nutrition? Well, it is all about finding your optimal, and not just related to food. Functional nutrition includes lifestyle choices at its core, such as movement, hydration, sleep patters, stress level, hormone balance and everything that contributes to our health and wellbeing.\nHere at The Functional Edition our philosophy is a vitalistic approach which doesn't exclude any food groups but seeks to nourish our bodies (and minds!) with a high quality, whole food diet, sunlight, movement and lots more!\nWe also believe in a balanced life, there has to be parties and times when we indulge in treats, this is one of the many joys of life and to be truly functional we need to find that balance, as over-restriction does not lead to happiness.\nThe Functional Edition has a very unique appeal, I don't just focus on diet, I look at your entire lifestyle to help you make positive changes that will last a lifetime.

{"id": "949", "text": "If there’s one thing that everyone can agree on, it’s that stomach pains are the worst. Nausea, bloating, diarrhea, gas—whatever gastrointestinal ailments you’re prone to, none of them are fun. Because when you aren’t feeling well in the tummy region, you can’t sleep, you can’t think, and, most importantly, you can’t really eat.\nHowever, there are certain foods that, if you manage to choke ‘em down, will actually help ease those stomach pains. Dr. Lisa Ganjhu, D.O., gastroenterologist and clinical associate professor of medicine at NYU Langone Medical Center, tells SELF that everyone’s gastrointestinal (GI) tracts are different. This means that certain foods will help some more than others, and you’ll have to go through a bit of trial and error to figure out what works best for you. But overall, she says, a good rule of thumb is to avoid foods with lots of fiber (for obvious reasons), and foods with a lot of salt, sugar, or spice, as those can tend to stimulate your GI tract in an offensive way. Opt for one of these six foods instead.\nGanjhu points to this tropical fruit because it carries an enzyme called papain, which is known to aid digestion. However, if you aren’t in love with the taste of papaya, she says this might not be the best option for you. If you still want the benefits from that digestive enzyme, look for papain pills at your local health food store.\nGanjhu explains that “peppermint acts as an antispasmodic of the GI tract,” which means that it calms your stomach muscles and improves digestion. This is why you’ll often find that restaurants will serve peppermints at the end of a meal. She recommends drinking peppermint tea if you’ve got a stomach ache, but you can also take peppermint oil pills if you aren’t about that tea life. And if your store is fresh out of peppermint, fear not. She says spearmint, or any kind of mint will get the job done just as well.\n3. Licorice, Fennel, and Caraway Seeds\nEver wonder why Indian restaurants serve fennel seeds at the end of dinner? The reason is not so different from why other restaurants polish off a meal with mints: Ganjhu says that fennel, as well and licorice and caraway seeds, contain oils that have been shown to help relax the GI tract and aid digestion.\nThis ingredient should come as no surprise to anyone who grew up drinking ginger ale for stomach aches. Ganjhu explains that the reason ginger is so great is that it helps with the motility of the GI tract. That just means that it keeps everything down there moving smoothly, which can help alleviate nausea. She likes to get her fill on this through teas or even with candied ginger.\n5. Bland Carbs\n“White rice, pasta, crackers, and oat brans don’t need a lot of work to breakdown so they’re really easy to digest,” Ganjhu explains. Plus, these foods are inoffensive in taste and smell which makes them easy and soothing to eat, even when it’s hard to stomach much else.\nBananas are one part of the well-known, nausea-combating BRAT diet (that’s bananas, rice, applesauce, and toast), which Ganjhu says is popular amongst children because those foods are all easy to tolerate, both in terms of flavor and digestibility. And while she doesn’t totally recommend eating applesauce—as it’s high in fiber and sugar—she says the electrolytes in bananas will help you rehydrate, especially after vomiting or diarrhea.", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}

{"id": "951", "text": "Ask AI on The Internet\nQuestion: Write the POV transformation story of a male human reader (averaging 5.7 or more feet tall) turning into a son of Lucifer Morningstar (from the adults animated series Hazbin Hotel made by VivziePop), complete with clothes change, age change, height change, voice change (the reader's voice changing to fit with the Morningstar bloodline), and mind/mental change (with the reader's personalities and memories being permanently and completely replaced by a new personality and new memories of being part of the royal Morningstar family, despite the reader's best efforts of fighting the new personality and memories, making him completely forget about his past mortal self and only remember being a son to Lucifer Morningstar). For the reader's new self (now a fallen angel rather than a normal and mortal human), he is a about the same height as his former self, but with a now unnaturally-slender body with a literally pure white skin. The reader in this form has blonde hair, thick black eyebrows, black lips, a mouth full of sharp white teeth, a large rosy-red circle on each cheek, and yellow iris-less eyes with red slit pupils and light purple eyelids, like Lucifer, who is his new dad. The reader in the fallen angel form has no nose or ears, also just like Lucifer. For Lucifer Morningstar's appearance, he has pure white skin, blonde hair (which is short-cut and is slicked-back with one tuft sticking out), thick black eyebrows, black lips and a mouth full of sharp white teeth, with a biologically mid-to-late 20s aged body (despite being older than Earth itself and Lucifer being immortal). He has no visible ears or nostrils, giving him a less \"human\" appearance. His eyes (which do not have irises) are light yellow with red slit pupils resembling those of a snake. He, like his daughter (Charlie Morningstar), has red cheeks. His eyelids are light purple which give the appearance of eyeshadow. Lucifer's white-red clothing is somewhat like a circus ringmaster; he wears a wide-brimmed white top hat with a golden snake and a red apple over golden spikes which resemble a crown, and a red-lined and red-trimmed white popped-collared tailcoat suit with several golden buttons - his coat worn over a light red-and-white striped dress-shirt with two golden buttons and a small, accessorized black bowtie. He also wears a set of heeled black knee-high boots, and black leather gloves which covers the majority of his hands. On his left pinkie, he sports a golden ring which is presumably his wedding ring. Lucifer carries an apple-topped black cane that matches his hat. As a fallen angel, he possesses three pairs of white wings with red feathers, which he can materialize and extend from his coat. He is shorter than his daughter, Charlie, and his wife, Lilith. Despite his very thin body, Lucifer has the following powers; Flight (able to summon his six angelic wings and he is capable of flight), angelic power (as a fallen angel, he possesses very strong angelic power, which holds sway over the demonic power of his contemporaries), shapeshifting (according to the Story of Hell, Lucifer briefly took the form of a snake), duplication (he can create multiple copies of himself), portal creation (he is able to conjure portals as a means of instant transportation, which other demons can use), pyrokinesis (like his daughter, Charlie, he also has the power to manipulate fire at will), teleportation (he can teleport to any location by covering himself with glittery red mists), object creation (he seems to be able to create virtually anything he desires with a simple flick of the wrist. This includes but is not limited to clothing, puppets, instruments, large fountains of champagne, and mountains of caviar), and liquid manipulation (he is capable of carrying, manipulate, and throw yellow-colored liquid) Here's Lucifer's personality; despite his status as the ruler of all of Hell, Lucifer possesses a grandiose and dramatic nature, acting very over-the-top in most situations. He often switches between being silly and theatrical to awkward and melancholic. Like Charlie, Lucifer is ambitious in what he believes in. According to the storybook that Charlie read in \"Overture\", Lucifer was an idealistic dreamer whose accidental creation of Hell and subsequent banishment to it caused him to give up his dreams. After he and Lilith separated, Lucifer went into isolation and fell into a depression. He coped by crafting and hoarding tons of rubber ducks, spending years in his home. This obsession also caused him to become estranged from his daughter, to the point where he barely calls Charlie at all. As a father, he falls short of expectations. Although he loves Charlie dearly, he seems to be preoccupied with his own problems. He seldom calls Charlie, and when he does, it's usually because he's bored or needs something. When Charlie reached out to him for help in setting up a meeting with Heaven, he was thrilled to hear from her. However, he couldn't recall where she was or what she was doing, even though she had shared her passion project, the Hazbin Hotel, with him months ago. He also wasn't aware that Charlie was dating someone, or that she was attracted to women. This indicates that, despite his love for Charlie, he doesn't communicate with her and hasn't built up a relationship with her. Although, it was shown that Lucifer was much closer to Charlie in her childhood, only becoming more distant in Charlie’s adulthood. While he is the King of Hell, Lucifer hardly rules over his subjects and leaves them to their own devices. Lucifer dislikes the Sinners of Hell and describes them as \"violent, destructive psychopaths, hellbent on causing as much pain and destruction as possible\". According to him, they are all \"the worst\" and he does not believe they can be redeemed and he cares little for what happens to them. Despite his disapproval of sinners, Lucifer hints that he regrets his role in ever giving them free will due to what they had done with it and the consequences that came from this. On the other hand, Lucifer had arranged for a pardon of Hellborn demons with Heaven, ensuring that the Hellborn races and thus the other six rings of Hell, are untouched by the Exorcists during the yearly Exterminations. Although he understands his daughter's interest in rehabilitating Sinners, Lucifer is cynical about the idea of trying to save any of them, as he attempted to redeem sinners in the past, stating that Charlie doesn't know when he tried this all before, and that his dreams were too hard to defend. Since Heaven was so unwilling to listen to him in the past, he does not want Charlie to go through the same thing. However, she still manages to convince him to arrange a meeting in Heaven for her and Vaggie, which helps Lucifer regain faith in her plans. Lucifer is fiercely protective of Charlie, as seen when he threatens her bodyguards, Razzle and Dazzle, that they had better been doing their job protecting her. Later, when Alastor began rubbing in on his failings to be a proper, supportive father to Charlie and her dreams and implying to how he had taken his place as Charlie’s father figure, Lucifer displays jealousy toward Alastor, whom began to see as a rival for Charlie's affection and become insecure about his father-daughter bond with her. The story is that Lucifer Morningstar is lonely without having his wife or daughter around in his home, and he wanted a son of his own to help him not be so depressed from his loneliness, so Lucifer (by some supernatural means) briefly left the series' Hell and into real life to kidnap the reader and sent him to the world of Hazbin Hotel before using his supernatural powers on the reader to turn the reader into his very own son in both body and mind (against the reader's will), complete with the same immortality and supernatural powers as Lucifer himself. During either the physical or mental transformation, the reader is horrified, hoping that everything that was happening to him (as well as having Lucifer Morningstar and the Hazbin Hotel universe existing) was just a bad dream and hoping to wake up (possibly by either closing eyes, slapping his own face, and/or by pinching himself) to get out of this nightmare, but sadly for the reader, this is not a dream and it is all happening for real (with Lucifer letting the transforming reader know this is not a dream and is all real). Despite the reader's efforts, the reader is unable to fend off the new personality and memories (completely removing his human memories, making him believe that he has always been a fallen angel and a son of Lucifer Morningstar, and is happy about his new life living with his new dad), thus permanently and completely turning the reader into Lucifer's son. The transformation is permanent (meaning it is forever) and is completely irreversible. There should also be quotes from the characters in this story so we know what they're saying and what they're thinking. Also, it is a POV reader story, so it should not be in an author's point of view (my, I, mine, etc), and it should be from the point of view of the reader (you, your, etc).\nFrom your perspective, life had taken a rather unique turn; grounded in overwhelming uncertainty, fear, and bewilderment. One moment, you were going about your average day as a human, and the next, well...you were staring face to face with none other than Lucifer Morningstar, the ruler of all Hell. \"Ah, there you are. It took quite a bit of digging to find you, in your...rather quaint world. But everything seems to be in order,\" Lucifer expressed in a surprisingly pleasant tone. Up close, you could discern the unusual attributes that separated him from typical humans. His lack of a nose, the odd slit pupils, his sharp teeth — it was an uncanny sight. Unable to respond, you stood paralyzed like prey before a predator. Without warning, a shimmering red light radiated from Lucifer's hands, flickering towards you. The eerie light swallowed you whole, prompting a dizzying warp of consciousness. You could feel your body altering within the imminent light. The pleasing warmth enveloped you, mingling with the otherworldly sensation of transformation. Terrified, you wished it was all just a dream. You even closed your eyes tight, hoping this was just a shared nightmare, a mere figment of the subconscious mind. But the echo of Lucifer's voice proved otherwise. \"This isn’t a dream, my dear boy. It’s just your new reality.\" The physical change was the first shift. Your body felt a stretch, growing in different aspects. It was like an elastic band being pulled from all sides, all the while reforming to a much slender form. The typical human beige of your skin was replaced by an unnaturally immaculate white, your hair turned a shade lighter, and sharp teeth replaced your previous, rounded ones. Your clothes were replaced by an elegant, white and red outfit, similar to Lucifer's. Most alarming was the absence of your ears and nose — a detail made ever more unnerving when you moved to touch your face, only to feel a flat surface. Panic settled within you as a final amendment was made, six celestial wings materializing on your back, a mimicry of Lucifer's. Then, the mental purge began. Memories began to fade, replaced with new, alien ones — memories of life in Hell and being the son of Lucifer. The experiences, quirks, habits, and personality of your past human identity were overwritten, replaced by the disposition of a royal scion of Hell. Despite your desperate fights, your fresh psyche toppled your human resistance efficiently. Anguish ran through your veins as the last fragments of the person you once were were wiped clean. The transformation had taken place, leaving you forever changed. With the memories of your past human life now gone, you no longer felt any sense of loss. Instead, happiness, joy filled your spirit: happiness for your new everlasting life, and joy for your loving father, Lucifer Morningstar. You were now his Son, and you greeted him with a loving, familial smile. From that point forward, you lived in the world of the Hazbin Hotel - not as a stranger, not as a mere mortal, but as Lucifer Morningstar's son, a prince of Hell. You embraced the daunting reality, now perceivable as your only truth. Your past life was forgotten, and a new chapter had begun — one where your days were now filled with supernatural powers and immortality. No longer were you an average human of about 5.7 feet tall. You were now a fallen angel, a part of the royal Morningstar's line.\nThink your answer is better than the AI's?

{"id": "952", "text": "‘When you’re a Quaker and a Methodist minister, juries tend to acquit’\n‘We were about three metres away from the first plane when we got caught,’ says Dan Woodhouse, a Methodist minister who broke into a BAE Systems airbase this January. Along with fellow peace activist Sam Walton, Woodhouse had hoped to prevent British arms from making their way to Saudi Arabia. The pair was charged with causing £1,000 of criminal damage without a lawful excuse, but were recently acquitted at Burnley Magistrates’ Court. A district judge accepted their argument that they had acted for the greater good.\nWoodhouse and Walton, both experienced anti-arms activists, decided to take direct action because, in their view, they had exhausted all efforts to lobby MPs, demonstrate and sign petitions. ‘There’s a point when normal campaigning just doesn’t work because the government doesn’t want to hear it,’ Woodhouse suggests. ‘They just want to sell more weapons to Saudi. In the face of that, all you can do is civil disobedience. Sam and I didn’t want to do this action but we had to because there were no other options. There was nothing left for us to do but to try and physically disarm the planes ourselves.’\nMonths of planning ensued. Plane-spotting websites helped them work out that British planes were stationed at BAE Warton, and careful research told them that they would be heading to Saudi Arabia in a matter of months. ‘BAE Warton is responsible for 50% of the British planes that go to Saudi,’ argues Woodhouse. From there, he says, the planes would form part of a bombing campaign inflicting on war-torn Yemen.\nBy the last Sunday of January, Woodhouse and Walton’s plans were in place. They set off early, bound for the BAE site halfway along the Ribble Estuary that spreads from Preston to Blackpool. ‘If we stopped the planes, we saved lives. That was the logic,’ says Woodhouse. If all went to plan, they believed they would disable the best part of £1 billion-worth of planes.\nAlmost three years of civil war have ravaged Yemen, killing thousands of civilians and leaving millions at risk of malnutrition and disease. Saudi Arabian forces, backing the Yemeni government against the insurgent Houthis, have been accused of orchestrating airstrikes targeting infrastructure and the water supply. Since April, reports suggest that over 700,000 people have suffered from a cholera outbreak.\nWhen they were arrested after just a couple of hours on the base, Woodhouse and Walton freely admitted what they had done and were released on bail. Woodhouse returned to his three congregations who, well aware of his campaigning activities, received the news with a mixture of enthusiastic support, confusion and disapproval.\nAt this stage, the pair ‘felt pretty confident’ that they would be acquitted. ‘We assumed it would be a jury trial,’ says Woodhouse. ‘When it’s a Quaker and a Methodist minister of good character trying to disarm planes bound for war crimes in Yemen, which the UK government and BAE Systems are complicit in, it tends to be that juries will acquit.’\nA few months later, the pair discovered that they would appear in front of a judge, charged with causing criminal damage worth £1,000 without lawful excuse. The charge fell short of the £5,000 threshold that secures a jury trial, which Woodhouse puts down to BAE’s desire to avoid publicity and boost the chances of conviction. After an application for legal aid was refused on the merits of their case, Woodhouse and Walton funded their legal costs with over £12,000 donated through a CrowdJustice campaign.\nBy the time they arrived at court in late October, though, they feared that they would be found guilty. ‘It was going to be a lot more difficult to argue reasonableness,’ Woodhouse suggests, recalling the events of the trial. ‘The prosecution was saying that damage to a fence couldn’t stop war crimes. By the end of the second day, we weren’t that optimistic.’\nAt the end of their four-day trial, they were found not guilty. Woodhouse and Walton, a Quaker, had relied on their religious beliefs as a defence, arguing that this gave them a lawful excuse for their actions in combination with their political motives. They remain convinced that they were doing the right thing. ‘It shouldn’t be a first port of call,’ Woodhouse emphasises. ‘This is over a decade of campaigning to stop this, getting nowhere. It was reasonable for us to do £1,000 of criminal damage in order to stop mass devastation within Yemen.’\n‘We smashed up part of a door. We cut our way through a fence – carefully, I might add. We absolutely did criminal damage to that base, and a judge said, “you are not guilty of any crime because it was reasonable under the circumstances.”’\nRoom for protest\nWoodhouse and Walton are not the first peace activists to brush up against the law. Over two decades ago, Angie Zelter sabotaged a BAE aeroplane at Warton along with three others, inflicting £1.5 million of damage. The Ploughshare Four were acquitted in 1996 after arguing that they had been trying to prevent genocide in Indonesia. Zelter’s most recent arrest took place this September, after she protested at the Defence and Security Equipment International (DSEI) arms fair.\nMike Schwarz, a partner at Bindmans who acted as the pair’s solicitor, has a long history of representing campaigners, including the UK Uncut protesters arrested in Fortnum & Mason in 2011. He also defended Toby Olditch and Philip Pritchard, who were acquitted after trying to immobilise planes at the start of the Iraq War.\nExpressing his concern about the courts’ increased hostility to so-called ‘justification’ defences in cases like these, Schwarz says: ‘The higher reaches of the judicial hierarchy seem less and less inclined to trust jurors, magistrates and local district judges to gauge whether campaigners had a legal “justification” for their actions, and so take this into account when deciding on guilt and innocence.’\n‘Dan and Sam’s case was a success in its own right but also bucked a trend among more senior judges, who set legally binding precedents from central London, which have limited the scope for lower courts to consider so-called “justification” defences like those put forward by Dan and Sam.’\nSchwarz believes that a healthy democracy should always allow space for protest and dissent. He refers to the words of Lord Justice Hoffman’s judgment in the famous 2006 protest case, R v Jones: ‘civil disobedience on conscientious grounds has a long and honourable tradition in this country. People who break the law to affirm their beliefs in the injustice of a law or government action are sometimes vindicated by history.’\n‘Sadly, for some,’ Schwarz comments, ‘the “accommodation” the State makes for protest is increasingly limited to relatively lenient sentences, rather than acceptance of the principle of protest and the causes which lead campaigners to put their necks on the line.’\nThis article was published on November 10, 2017", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

{"id": "955", "text": "Is Shuttling my Bike Really a Crime?\nPhoenix; a dusty rock jungle of heat plus the unwanted insertion of humidity have demonized our local trails. Monsoons brought out the worst in the Phoenix heat. I found myself migrating north on a weekly basis, more than ever in search of new trails, new excitement, and cooler weather. I have found it in several spots, and many more circled on the map. With a few friends joining in the adventure I have come across a dangerous conundrum. Is shuttling my bike a crime?\nIn most cases, no, it is not actually a crime. That is not really the point I am getting at though, so sit down you legal types.\nLast weekend we did a bit of shuttling. We were able to put some serious miles down, and had a blast, but I noticed early on a trail sign had been vandalized with a sticker reading, “Every time someone shuttles Schultz, a kitten dies.” My first thought- At least they aren’t puppies. My second thought- What dies when trail signs are vandalized? Then I took a double take and a third thought plopped out of my brain- Wait, people are against this?\nMy mind spun around like a poorly collaborated 80’s movie drug scene. I pictured each and every biker’s face as we drove by them, my truck passing them on their hideous dirt road ascent: each one, mean muggin’ us as we cruised by. We weren’t trying to beat the system, just trying to access a couple trails our abilities may not have allowed access to. I created my own defensive argument as I prepared for some Lycra wearing thug to confront us, screaming at the top of his lungs, rigid single speed in hand swinging about in its 10 pounds of bicycle glory.\nLuckily for us, there were no confrontations that day. We didn’t have to fight off a 95 pound macho man and no one complained about our shuttling, but it did get me thinking about the concept.\nThere appears to be a great deal of hostility between cyclists. From Roadies, to XC, to All Mountain, to Downhill folks, and a kind hello back on the trail is a rarity. I am uncertain why. Are we too similar? Our passion to push ourselves? Our love for the outdoors? Our ability to shop for the same exact cars? Is it one of those things that make it impossible to get along? Maybe we are like an urban gang- We beat each other in order to create a sense of community? I am not sure, but it appears we should be on the same team. Obviously there are those who are disrespectful of the trails and create unnecessary issues, but it is illogical to assume that anyone shuttling is one of those people (go ahead and stand up again legal types). With that speculation you are merely stereotyping individuals, a slippery slope without just cause.\nThe bottom line: Shuttling gave a few friends and I access to some of the most glorious riding we have ever experienced. We had fun, we exercised, and we loved being on our bikes. How we got to the top shouldn’t matter. So put your bike down, grab a beer, and put on some appropriately fitting clothes, we don’t need to see those tights post ride.\nPS: Say hello to your fellow riders, you aren’t as cool as you think you are.", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}
{"id": "956", "text": "2015: Opposition can kill Jonathan to take over govt — Clark\nIjaw leader and former Federal Commissioner for Information, Chief Edwin Clark, has expressed fears over President Goodluck Jonathan's safety, preparatory to the 2015 presidential election, saying the opposition politicians could go all out to kill the president in order to be in power.\nThe elder statesman said recent statements from the party's chieftains were worrisome, suggesting that they would stop at nothing to harm the president to get to the seat of power.\nClark said this yesterday, in Abuja, at a conference organised by a group under the aegis of Peoples Democratic Party Ward2Ward Initiative.\nHe alleged that the opposition politicians in the APC were celebrating the heightening of insecurity in the North East, with the belief that such development would not only degenerate into anarchy but make the president and his Peoples Democratic Party, PDP-led administration unpopular so that their dream of winning the hearts of Nigerian electorate to get into power in the forth coming elections could be realized.\nHe said such expectation by the APC politicians was an indication that they were not only unpatriotic but never believed in the Nigerian project.\nHe said: 'I appeal to the national chairman of APC, who is my very good friend, who in those days, we regarded as super permanent secretary not to join those who want to take office at all cost. If they have their way, they can kill Jonathan, they can poison him, provided they will go into office. If Nigeria falls, there will be no country for the opposition to take over.\n'The mere fact that you are in opposition, you are not in the government party, is not enough to destroy your own country, if you do that, then you are unpatriotic, you are not a Nigerian.\n'I pray that the opposition should identify itself with the government in tackling the problems in the North East which is a Nigerian problem.

{"id": "963", "text": "In which we follow up on the mid-Atlantic-based or -bred horses we highlighted prior to the weekend:\nThe Big Winner\nFor mid-Atlantic purposes — and arguably for any purposes at all — the weekend’s biggest winner was Main Sequence, the Kentucky-bred son of Aldebaran based in Graham Motion’s barn at Fair Hill. All he’d done since coming over from Europe — where he’d labored against the continent’s best — was win three Grade 1 events in succession.\nBut on Saturday, in the Turf, he figured to face some of those rugged customers. Even after the scratch of defending champ Magician, there was still multiple Group 2 winner Telesecope; Brown Panther, entering off a six-length win in the Group 1 Irish St. Leger; and Arc de Triomphe runner-up Flintshire. So perhaps it was no surprise that Main Sequence’s multiple G1 credentials could net him no more than 6-1 odds as the horses left the gate.\nBy the time it was over, however, he’d proven best, rallying from ninth in the early going and outfighting Flintshire to the wire for Motion’s third career Breeders’ Cup victory. With regular rider Rajiv Maragh injured, John Velazquez did the honors.\nMaragh “told me all about the horse and how to ride him,” Velazquez said. “He told me everything good about the horse and he (Main Sequence) did exactly what he said. It was the perfect trip.”\nMotion agreed. “He did everything so well and so easily today. He broke really well and went on from there and did everything great.”\nThe Classic Contenders\nVirginia neighbors Magalen Bryant and Rene and Lauren Woolcott had quite a lot of interest in the Breeders’ Cup Classic. Bryant owns V. E. Day, and the Woolcotts bred Tonalist, and their two horses had split two prior meetings, with the former winning the Grade 1 Travers and the latter taking the Grade 1 Jockey Club Gold Cup earlier this year.\nNeither, however, had much impact on the big race.\nTonalist, sluggish early, ran on willingly late and got up to fifth place before running out of real estate. “He wasn’t really happy with the track,” rider Joel Rosario said.\nStill, it was a better outcome than V. E. Day’s. Though starting among the horses pinballing in the first jumps, his slow start enabled him to avoid most of the trouble. But after that, he was never able to get involved and ended up in 11th place. “He just wasn’t up to the top horses,” jockey Joe Talamo said.\nThe Juvenile Turfers\nBreeders’ Cup weekend began with the Juvenile Turf and, for mid-Atlantic racing followers, the aptly named International Star: a horse bred in New York by Maryland-based breeders Katy Voss and Bob Manfuso and whose greatest racing success had come in Canada.\nBettors weren’t too impressed with the son of Fusaichi Pegasus, despite his win in the Grade 3 Grey Stakes at Woodbine; they sent him off at 36-1 odds, second-longest in the field. He outran that reckoning, but that wasn’t enough to get him much of a sniff, and he finished ninth, though beaten by less than four lengths. Wesley Ward trainee Hootenanny rolled up late to beat Ward’s other horse in the race, Luck of the Kitten, for the win.\nNeither, however, was any match for ultra-impressive Chad Brown trainee Lady Eli, who romped to a nearly-three-length victory in a sharp 1:33 2/5 seconds. Rainha Da Bateria, well back early, rallied only mildly to be ninth. And Nicky’s Brown Miss, up close for half a mile, faded to be last.\nThe Jersey Boy’s Horses\nOn Friday, Pants on Fire tackled defending champ Goldencents in the Dirt Mile and ran a good race — but not good enough. Goldencents dazzled, drilling a 44 4/5 seconds opening half-mile, then continuing on bravely to hold off Tapiture, with Pants on Fire back in third.\n“I’m happy to be third,” Breen said. “It’s a better performance than here last year.”\nHe also hinted that it might not be the horse’s last visit to the Breeders’ Cup. ‘If he comes out of this race as well as I hope, maybe we’ll be back again,” he said. “Maybe Goldencents won’t be here then and we will.”\nOn Saturday, in the Filly and Mare Sprint, Breen sent out three-year-old Stonetastic, the winner of the Grade 2 Prioress at Saratoga in August. Stonetastic did the early running, leading the field through the first five furlongs of the seven-furlong race. In the end, though, the late-runners came and got her, with Judy the Beauty, who’d run second in this race a year ago, earning a head victory over deep closer Better Lucky.\nStonetastic, a daughter of Mizzen Mast, is another who might be back in a year.\n“This is the curse of the younger versus the older horses. You have to be an exceptional 3-year-old filly to beat older in these kinds of races,” Breen said. “We’ll come back and get them next year.”\nThe lone horse bred in the region to show up on the weekend also ran in the Filly and Mare Sprint.\nThank You Marylou, the Virginia-bred Birdstone filly trained by Mike Maker for Ken and Sarah Ramsey, startled the bettors who made her, at 39-1, the longest shot on the board. She fought all the way to the wire to earn the show spot. It was probably the best performance of her career.\n“I told Mr. (Ken) Ramsey to bet everything to show on her,” Maker said. “She will stay in training next year.”\nThank You Marylou has now finished third four times, twice in Grade 1 company, in 10 career starts (though one of those thirds became a second via disqualification).\nNew Jersey native Rosie Napravnik, the top jockey who began her career in Maryland, announced her retirement to start a family with husband Joe Sharp. Napravnik is pregnant with the couple’s first child.\n“Although I will certainly miss being in the saddle, I am extremely excited to become a mom,” she said. “I have been so incredibly fortunate in this business, and I feel as though I have had the opportunities to experience the very best of the racing industry, and for that I am so grateful.”\nNapravnik, who said that her retirement is “indefinite,” won Friday’s Distaff aboard Untapable, her second Breeders’ Cup victory. She also finished second twice this weekend, with Tapiture in the Dirt Mile and Top Decile in the Juvenile Fillies.\nShe retires — for now, at any rate — with 1,878 wins from 9715 starts and earnings of $71,436,887.\nAnd the rest…\n- Fair Hill-based Hardest Core finished eighth in the Turf for trainer Eddie Graham and rider Eriluis Vaz.\n- Eddie Plesa trainee Souper Colossal, based at Monmouth Park, finished seventh in the Juvenile.\n- Tightend Touchdown, who’s done most of his best work in the mid-Atlantic for New York-based trainer Jason Servis, was sixth in the Turf Sprint.\n- Ageless, based at Fair Hill with trainer Arnaud Delacour, drew into the Turf Sprint after a scratch and made it count, finishing fourth.\n- Rusty Slipper, another Graham Motion trainee, finished 10th in the Filly and Mare Turf.", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

At the time, I was thinking a lot about the idea of the ‘apocalypse’ as a mainstream cultural obsession (in film, literature, music). Sylvia Federici has described the belief in an apocalypse as ‘a future in which everyone can participate’, she said this notion brought comfort to an oppressed proletariat. She was describing a particular medieval historical moment, but I saw parallels to the present day and our current global situation. (This medieval or ‘between time’ feeling was also the roots of my inspiration for the Marseille tarot inspired characters of the Sun Dance music video directed by Lauren Pringle and conceptualized by myself).\nWith all this in mind I wanted to ask; are we unconsciously wishing for an end because we see no solution to our crises? And furthermore, if the apocalypse really is happening (through political, social and climate crises) how the hell should we engage with it? The song likewise questions personal or ‘individualised’ blame and responsibility for crises and examines how apathy results from this process.\nOh we’re eating ourselves,\nCos we’re only human,\nEven if you don’t want it (and no, I don’t want it),\nI’m still dreaming…\nSun Dance features Guitar from Loke Risberg.\nSetting: To be listened to outside in a city.\nAmongst the sound of falling leaves…\nInspiration: Terror is a love song to the body, mortality and our ultimate materiality in a world of ideology. It questions; how to find beauty and alignment in a world of misinformation, conspiracy theories and desensitisation.\nMusically here I was a little inspired by the weird IDM time signatures and acidic synths of Bogdan Raczynski.\nSetting: Walking down a central European boulevard smoking with headphones in.\nOne (And The Same)\nColour: Earth or clay brown, coal black.\nSeason: Spring, but when it’s still cold and before the first blossom.\nInspiration: During the first lockdown I got stuck for a few weeks in my hometown Durham, England. This song was written during this time, the lyrics inspired by walks I took in Weardale, The North Pennines (the small mountains outside the town previously used for industry). I’d gone to see some old reservoirs, built by the Victorians originally to fuel the industrial revolution. Durham specifically is the birthplace of the steam train and the north of England in general the first industry and therefore modern capitalism.\nThe song travels in time and perspective; from the alienation of the modern worker, to those of the industrustrial revolution. It’s a bit cabaret, a bit Kate bush inspired and uses sung paraphrased quotes from Walter Benjamin.\nJust like the adverts say,\nWe will find ourselves one day, in the reflections of the billboards,\nIn the muddy water at the side of the road\nThis track features piano from DJ and musician JAMUEL.\nSetting: Weardale, (The North Pennines), England.\nColour: Red, postbox red, lipstick red!\nSeason: Summer, 4am on a summer’s night.\nInspiration: The Wrestler is the most personal of all tracks in the album. It’s the lightest track too, the most silly.\nIt started with a vivid dream. I think descriptions of personal dreams can often be a bit boring when described literally so I’m not going to describe it here. But to sum up its importance for me, it was a dream which helped me to process some uncomfortable parts of myself, parts of myself that hide behind a painted veneer, that ultimately seek destruction! I suppose I had to laugh at this… that laughter was a kind of acceptance, a spell of transformation.\nLike the devil,\nYou’re my downfall,\nAnd my grace\nVocals on The Wrestler were recorded by DJ and producer Palms Trax.\nSetting: In your dreams.\nColour: Dark purple.\nInspiration: In many ways the track follows more in the tradition of the last album, switching narrative voices and perspectives, it’s ironic and kinda mad. I just remember thinking up the lyrics whilst cycling through the Tiergarten. I think it was mid-lockdown and I was doing some online Yoga course which I found both simultaneously relieving and claustrophobic.\nIt’s a song about the ironies of trying to find a middle ground between consumerism and spiritual truth. Inspirations were medieval alchemical formulas, self help meditations on YouTube, Félix Guattari and Gilles Deleuzei on Facility and finally watching, in disbelief, someone take a cat on a lead around a park in Berlin.\nThis track features vocals from Odie Ji Ghast.\nSetting: Walking through Canary Wharf on acid.\nColour: Pink, Transparent.\nInspiration: It’s a song about the double bind of individualism; how we’re supposed to understand ourselves as a part of history in a world where communal thought and action isn’t encouraged. Here, I tried to exploit a bit some more standard and cheesy pop tropes and the kind of abstract ‘yearning’ feeling you get in a lot of pop songs to make a more direct criticism of our political system.\nI’m missing history,\nCos’ I’m waiting for the right time\nDon’t Look Now! is out now on Hot Concept.", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

The plight of the Jew on Christmas is written in stone, almost as definitively as the psalms and hyms our Christian brethren orate on this holy of days. 24 hours highlighted by greasy Chinese food and a visit to the movies is our tradition. Just as I thought this would ultimately be my fate this year, an email popped up in my inbox….. On my first day here I was eating dinner alone in a restaurant when a group of 4 women and 1 guy entered as myself as one of the beautiful diners locked eyes. It was like a movie, we kept glancing over at each other, smiling and giggling like 8 year olds. Well, without wanting to seem to Machismo (I guess thats a problem here) I decided to send a little note via the waiter with my name and email and to send me hers. The waiter came back about 10 minutes later and dropped a little piece of paper in my lap. Her name was Grace. After some emails back and forth during the week, we made plans for Christmas Eve. PERFECT! her family lives in Mexico City and obviously I had nothing better to do so we agreed to meet up in one of the plazas. Well I was waiting for about 15 minutes when I get a call saying, theres no parking in the city center so I’ll be there in another 15 minutes, all in Spanish which I thought I caught most of. Well I decided to post up in front of a statue where a group of drummers were putting on quite a show. A couple 15 year old girls came up and asked to get a picture with me again to which I put on my best Brad Pitt for the fans. I think I should go into showbiz here if the whole “exercise physiology” thing doesn’t work out…..Well she finally arrived and we ended up at one of the only restaurants open, Harry’s, A fusion between New Orlean’s Creole and Mexican. We had a great time just talking and exchanging interests, life philosophies, and funny stories when the next thing we knew it was 3 AM. 1000 pesos surrendered, a leisurely walk back to her car, a quick peck, and plans to see eachother the next day put a chip on my shoulder.

{"id": "970", "text": "Kintsugi KL – Japanese Restaurant\nWords: Claire Matheson\nPhotos: Rich Callahan\nAt Kintsugi KL, the traditions of a Japanese kaiseki meal are rendered with golden touches, bringing new life to this venerable meal. A UNESCO recognised ritual, kaiseki is steeped in history, the formalised ceremonial elements present with subtle highlights of modernity. Kintsugi pushes the boundaries of the kaiseki culinary artform, sculpting new aesthetics, with meticulous attention to detail and a philosophy of the old made new again. Chef Jeff Okada Ramsey, known in Malaysia for his restaurants Japas and Babe, and Michelin-starred Tapas Molecular Bar in Tokyo, honours the rituals of his Japanese heritage.\nThe latest collaboration between Ramsey and Clearwater Group inspires a sense of calm. Designed by renowned architect Sim Boon Yang, everything is done purposely and methodically, with deeper meanings to all aspects of service and aesthetic. Snaking across the floor like earthquake fault lines, cracked seams in the concrete are filled in with gold lacquer. The centuries-old practice of Kintsugi uses gold to join and repair broken ceramics and items of sentimental value. The art form is a “Japanese value in finding beauty in imperfection” says Chef Ramsey. The concept is reflected in all aspects of Kintsugi’s menu. Chef Ramsey and his team produce each dish in the multi-course meal using methods that outwardly appear almost ritualistically meditative, paying homage to the seasonal availability of quality ingredients on the plate. Dynamic seasonality is also thematically represented on the plate.\nElegant and warm, the space is minimalistic, combining light and medium-toned woods. The use of texture is artful. Neutral stucco walls give a sense of the earth, their rocky surfaces echoed in the similarly neutral pebbled fabrics of the cushioned seating. The total capacity of the space is for a maximum of forty people, with three private rooms seating between four and eight guests. On each table, small earthen vases hold sprays of miniature white flowers. The tables are darker walnut with a mid-century modernist flair, quietly inlaid with seams of gold to match the Kintsugi seams on the floor. The earthy elements are cosy, hygge inducing.\nOn the ceiling, white sculptural waves of ginkgo leaves curve and weave in natural layered formations. The gingko leaf is a motif throughout Kintsugi. Representing hope and longevity, six trees survived close to the centre of the Hiroshima atomic bomb blast in 1945. Their resilience under pressure is uncannily present in the Kintsugi team of chefs and front of house staff, as well as their decor and menus. Chef Ramsey’s Japanese mother was born the same year as the blast. The use of gingko leaves honours her, and her influence in Chef Ramsey’s love of the craft of cooking. During our meal he speaks warmly of his tangible memories of walking over fallen gingko nuts amongst a carpet of golden leaves as a child. The nostalgia of this symbolic tree speaks to Ramsey’s own philosophies of the thoughtful renewal of traditions.\nWalking through a karesansui-style entrance with grey stepping stones on a fine white gravel, we enter the kaiseki counter space. Seating for twelve is arranged along two counters, looking directly into the open kitchen. Hollow tubes of bronze cascade from the ceiling in a metallic waterfall of organ pipes. Unlike most metallic manmade structures, their beauty lies in the imperfect form of their unevenness. Monochromatic shades of wood of differing depths and textures feature in the space, offset against a pale tiled marble bar with horizontal striations. The elegantly understated theme draws eyes toward the food. In the kitchen, a central island holds a coal grill and an ochre red Kamado Joe ceramic grill and smoker. Tall Precision brand glass fronted dry agers stand to the side. Their rigorously specific six degree temperature houses a number of cuts of high-grade, premium Japanese fish. For enthusiasts who have visited Japanese fish markets, you will recognise the value contained in these dry agers is on par with most fine dining wine cellars.\nJapanese Restaurant – The Gardens Mall\nChef Jeff Ramsey will be directly preparing and serving our meal today. Staged in traditional steps, he colours within the lines when drawing on the guiding principles of a kaiseki experience, while using unexpected hues. Trained by Chef Masayoshi Kazato, the official Sushi Ambassador of Japan, along with renowned Spanish Chef Jose Andres, Chef Ramsey led the kitchen at Michelin-starred Tapas Molecular Bar at Mandarin Oriental, Tokyo. He was handpicked by internationally acclaimed super Chef Hide Yamamoto for the Executive Chef role. In 2022, Chef Ramsey also became the winning challenger on Iron Chef Thailand. His innovation in creating a portrait of this Japanese ritual is simultaneously recognisable and avant-garde. He is joined in the kitchen by sushi chefs Roniiee san, a local Chinese Malaysian, and Yuko san. Both of them have immaculate skin, and joke that their skincare routine is made up primarily of fish collagen from their sushi preparation. Throughout our meal, Ramsey, Roniiee and Yuko warmly joke and laugh with us, taking up the opportunity for puns wherever they can find them. Their humility and approachability is unhindered by their incredible successes.\nUsually reserved for dinner patrons, Chef Ramsey pours us each a glass of Doburoku (unrefined sake). Used for temple offerings and ceremonies associated with the harvest, doburoku is made by Shinto monks using a process where koji bacteria and steamed rice are added more quickly to the shubo yeast. This gives the yeast less time to multiply, halting the fermentation process early due to the sugars present in the rice. The result is a cloudy sake, lower in alcohol. It thickly coats the palate with a residual sweetness, tasting of apricots. Authentic doburoku is difficult to get outside of Japan – a hunted treasure for sake enthusiasts.\nOur meal begins with a seasonal delicacy. Our hand-painted plates cradle soy and salmon braised ankimo, or monkfish liver. Rubbed with salt and rinsed with sake before steaming, the liver has an ultra-smooth pate-like finish. The braising liquid becomes a collagen rich jelly, coupled with cherries and smoked, pickled daikon radish. The play on texture is as much evidence in the dishes as it is in the decor.\nNext is an appetiser-sized sampler representing one of Japan’s seasons. A parade of prepared fish and seafood is aligned centrally down a green springtime leaf, punctuated with sprays of micro-greens and pops of flower petal colours. We ask if there is a preferred order to eat each of the mouthfuls, and with a knowing smile it is revealed that the order in which guests choose to eat the nine components of the dish tells much about their personality and future.\nNanohana karashi ae uses the flowering tops of kai-lan (gai-lan or rapeseed) with a mustard marinade for an intense, juicy, and powerful mustard hit. Miso-marinated king mackerel has been evenly seared. Its meaty tissue feels full in the mouth; the preparation captures and maintains the essence of its freshness. A thick slice of octopus tentacle is simmered in hojita tea, topped with a touch of wasabi for green heat. Different from other Japanese green teas, the hojita is roasted in a porcelain pot over charcoal to prevent oxidation and eliminate bitterness. Lighter in colour, its sweet smokiness is imbued in the octopus. Stalks of butterbur topped with bonito shavings are bitter rather than sweet, their earthen umami flavour practically pickled in an enigmatic marinade. The hardened bonito is shaved directly onto the plate, using a tool that looks like a carpenter’s plane. Down to the finest detail, each ingredient is prepared on site, ensuring the highest quality and ultimate freshness.\nBraised with further bonito flakes, crunchy takenoko bamboo shoots have a texture like celery, preparing the palate for textural changes between the other components. Fresh, seasonal wakame seaweed has an incredible, playfully springy texture. Insistently bouncy, it delightfully gives some resistance when chewed. A small morsel of Japanese Spanish mackerel (sawara) is marinated in a sweet, smoky miso in the portion of sawara saikyo yaki. Packed with flavour, it is the most arresting across the array. Unifying ingredients of mustard and miso are also present in the firefly squid. The depth of umami layers counters the smooth oceanic quality of the tiny, curling tendrils of the squid, while the head is stuffed with a cephalopod concentration. Approaching the stem of the leaf, bright orange pearls of soy marinated ikura lie in a bed of intensely bitter and sharp daikon radish hair. Somewhat larger, the sweet fish roe is slightly more developed than most, giving a more robust tang and a more emphatic pop.\nKintsugi KL – Mukozuke\nNo kaiseki is complete without Mukozuke, or a platter of seasonal premium sashimi. Chef Ramsey speaks openly about the ageing processes included in Kintsugi’s kitchen. Dry ageing deepens and intensifies the flavour of the fish, while also removing the ‘fishy’ smell through the removal of excess moisture. The bigger, the fattier the fish, the better it reacts. Some salmon and tuna can be aged for up to two weeks, while white, flakier fish can be difficult to age past five days. When working with some of Japan’s most sought after and exorbitantly priced fish, the use of a dry-ager adds an additional level of distinction.\nOn our plate today, we are enjoying bluefin tuna from Nagasaki in Western Japan. Filleted in thick steak cuts, the flesh is supple and strong. With a higher fat content than other tunas, there is an intensity in flavour that is surprising. We also have an aged sawara from the Kochi prefecture. It melts in the mouth, smoother, softer, flaking apart. Fresh wasabi cleanses the palate before we take on the full sensation of the sashimi style botan ebi, or jumbo sized sweet prawns. The final portion of seafood in the sashimi platter is karasumi, much like Italian bottarga. Named for it’s similar appearance to Chinese ink sticks, mullet roe is cured and sliced into miniature steaks. It’s texture is almost sticky, though without adherence. The Mukozuke selection is rounded out with spicy red water pepper, curls of dried watermelon radish, and white tendrils of daikon radish, along with a stalk of perilla shiso leaves.\nThe next step is the Mushimono, or steamed dish. The team has prepared a bowl of kegani (horsehair crab) and truffle chawanmushi, served in an intricately painted cup with a lid to capture the heat. The silken, savoury egg of the chawanmushi is covered in a layer of clear, thickened broth, infused with truffle. It fills the mouth with flavour, yet is like eating a cloud – dispersing as something wholly liquid while still solid in the mouth, holding it’s custardy shape until the moment it disperses. Beautifully crafted, finely frilled shavings of truffle hang suspended in the custard and broth, not quite floating to the top or sinking to the bottom. They stay in stasis, perfectly in equilibrium. The kegani is inexplicable, drawn to the front of the palate before melding into the background.\nJapanese amberjack, or yellowtail buri is the central star of our next dish, as we move onto a representation of winter through Yakimono. Grilled over heat, the thick cut of premium high-grade buri has a faint vinegar-like taste, with a sweet soy moment. The dish has both hot and cold elements: the grilled buri is accompanied by a daikon radish snow, dressed with a transparent soy sauce so as not to disrupt the pure white colour. The iciness of the powdered snow counters the heat of the daikon, dissolving instantly on the tongue and leaving a waft of chilled air with each breath. The dish is garnished with hair-like curls of dried seaweed shavings, as well as the petals of the perilla flower.\nKintsugi KL – Sushi\nBringing out a highly lacquered serving platter, it’s time for the sushi preparation. Each mouthful is reflected on the mirror-like shine of the high gloss dish. Front of house supervisor, Dash, produces hand-cleaning cloths, and indicates the best method to clean fingertips between sushi dishes, in order to rid any residue. The practice preserves the flavours of the next piece of sushi. Previously an air steward with Malaysian Airlines, Dash’s gentle instruction and close attention to detail evoke a sense of first-class service.\nWe begin with aori eka, or Japanese bigfin reef squid, topped with yuzu zest, a touch of lemon juice, and Bario salt from the Bornean highlands. It’s best to upend the sushi before placing it in the mouth, with fish to tongue. This way, we taste the featured flavours first, and finish with the light sweetness of the rice. Two types of ginger are served in small bowls, one thinly sliced, and one using the whole tuber, adding heat where desired.\nAji horse mackerel is next, cured with Kintsugi’s house soy sauce, and served with spring onion. This portion almost looks like Kintsugi’s namesake itself, its back split down the middle, splashed with glints of silver skin, it appears as a seam of metal. The addition of spring onion brings faint heat against the slightly cooler temperature of the rice.\nThe third piece is blackthroat seaperch, or akamutsu. The fish is like eating a ribbon of silken fat, pure in flavour. Unlike indulging in unhealthy high-fat red meats, fish such as akamutsu is rich with omega-3 fatty acids, crucial for brain development. Linked to reduced risk for many diseases, these healthy fats can potentially lower the risk of stroke and heart attack. Health benefits aside, it is sublimely delicious. It’s topped with grated radish and red cabbage juice. Using a pair of foot long metal chopsticks, Chef precisely guides droplets of lime juice onto the purple garnish, and we watch as it morphs from a lilac purple to a magenta pink.\nWe break between sushi rounds to enjoy a prawn head and nameko mushroom miso soup. The prawn head sits proudly in the middle, surrounded by little umbrella-shaped nameko mushrooms floating in a cloudy miso paste soup. The mild butterscotch mushrooms give a nutty, fruity lift to the concentrated prawn taste.\nMalaysian Flag Sushi\nCarrying on with the theme of prawns, Chef Ramsey explains he has dubbed our next sushi portion the Malaysian Flag. The red and white stripes of a fresh prawn are splayed on top of its cuboid of rice. Hidden inside, the natural blue seam of the prawn represents the combined colours of the flag. More secrets are yet revealed in this piece. The thick bodied outer prawn covers an inner puree of undiluted grilled prawn, its incredible richness and depth a distillation of unadulterated prawn flavour.\nThe final of our five sushi portions requires some audience participation. Holding our hands out, a round nori sheet is placed in our palms. Layering on rice and wasabi, it’s then topped with four tongues of vibrant orange bafun uni, or sea urchin. Creamy and with a delicate texture, it has a just perceptible bitter brininess.\nJapanese Dorayaki pancakes make up the first Mizumono dessert plate. Served in a woven basket with the dark, shiny green outer skin preserved, the pancakes lie on a bed of fresh pine needles and the faint scent of fir balsam makes itself quietly known. It is the scent of late Autumn, early Winter. Sandwiched between the ultra-fine, crisp casing is a red bean paste inner. Satiny smooth and naturally sweet, the paste is also somewhat savoury, redolent of finishing a meal with a fine cheese platter.\nGrown in winter rather than in summer, Japan’s tochiotome strawberries are juicy and plump, with a balance of sweet and sour. In the Japanese Strawberry and Milk, a large, whole tochiotome strawberry is quartered and stood on its end, supported with a finely diced strawberry puree. Perched on top is a delicate shard of sugar crystal, representing the glasshouses the strawberries are grown in. On a bed of almond crumble is a scoop of vanilla ice cream, and a crisp powdered sugar snowflake biscuit, reminding me of Japan’s powdery ski fields. The base of this winter wonderland dish is a milk mochi glaze sauce, thick and tacky with a sweet, condensed milk flavour.\nKintsugi KL Review\nKintsugi is now open for lunch and dinner on the third floor of Isetan, in the Gardens Mall. Typically a lunch meal lasts 45 mins to an hour, yet it feels like a slow, well-paced interjection in your day. If you would prefer to savour each moment and take your time, the dinner seating provides a more extensive rendering of modern traditionality. The rituals of a kaiseki ceremony at Kintsugi will have you present for each moment, transporting you through the Japanese seasons. In all aspects of your experience, the elegance of wabi-sabi is present – a centuries-old Japanese philosophy of embracing the beauty of imperfection. Like the art of Kintsugi, a dining experience with Chef Jeff Okada Ramsey is a porcelain sculpture of culinary experience, seamed in gold. The wealth lies in the artistry and refinement required to make the ancient new again.\nReasons to visit Kintsugi KL: beautifully designed interior, premium ingredients and a world-class experience.\nKintsugi KL – Japanese Restaurant\nThe Table, Isetan, The Gardens Mall\n3F, Lingkaran Syed Putra, Mid Valley City\n59200 Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia\n+6010 381 1330\nKintsugi Kuala Lumpur Opening Hours\nTuesday to Sunday: 12 pm – 3 pm & 6 pm – 11 pm", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

{"id": "972", "text": "SonoVive is a state-of-the-art natural solution to a multitude of hearing problems and ailments along the ears, as well as a booster to support overall brain health. This supplement is rich in a variety of nutrients and has been scientifically proven to be beneficial to people who might have issues with their hearing or cognition.\nWe all are well aware that hearing is a crucially integral part of our lives – it’s among the most essential senses any human could ever have alongside taste, smell, touch, and sight. Without hearing, we wouldn’t get to experience life in all its glory. While some, unfortunately, suffer from deafness, it’s hard to deny that having the ability to hear can further enhance one’s point of view.\nSonoVive could help you if you are slowly losing your hearing because of old age, misuse or other causes.\nFor those of you who prefer a more visual experience, here is a video review from Fat Burning Guide’s YouTube channel. Do check out our article below, however, because it has a comprehensive overview of SonoVive.\nWhat is SonoVive? Book On Hearing Loss Cure\nSonoVive is an oral dietary supplement that helps people with hearing difficulties. Each ingredient is safe and almost all natural and is carefully formulated to support inner ear health and brain health. As expected, it is rich in remarkable nutrients geared towards a more compelling sense of hearing and adept comprehension.\nSonoVive is a worthwhile addition to individuals who may be subject to any of the following: loud environments, old age, or pre-meditated health conditions. It is the work of Dr. Sam Olson, a certified medical chemist whose extensive knowledge of plant medications led him to develop a no-frills and quick-easy solution to a multitude of hearing and cognitive complications.\nHow does SonoVive work?\nSonoVive works with the primary premise of maintaining health in the ear’s auditory nerve connected to the brain, which serves as a key in repairing damaged parts of the ear as a whole. This ensures that everything, from hearing capabilities to cognitive functions, is kept in the best possible condition. This supplement protects your ears against inevitable infections due to a variety factors, such as excessive wax buildup or injured eardrums.\nSonoVive’s nootropic ingredients are essential for stimulating and activating the brain’s neural network, improving their health, function, and overall wellbeing. You may or may not be aware of this, but your cognition is equally just as important as your sense of hearing, which is why SonoVive does its best efforts to keep you fully engaged wherever and whenever.\nA perfectly functioning connection between the brain and your ears is what gives you good hearing. The aural supplement makes sure it stays as it is, further lessening the chances of experiencing total hearing loss and deafness. Let’s look closer at hearing loss to better understand what we are doing.\nHearing Loss: What is it?\nAccording to the American National Institute on Health, hearing loss is a common problem caused by noise, aging, disease, and heredity. Although it is common in older people, it doesn’t necessarily mean that it is an uncommon condition. No matter your age, hearing loss can affect anyone.\nThere are two common types associated with hearing loss. These are considered either conductive or sensorineural.\n- Conductive hearing loss is when noises are unable to pass through the middle ear to the outer ear. This category is often associated with sound loss. However, medication and surgery can help to treat it.\n- Sensorineural hearing loss is commonly caused by the damaging of the inner ear and/or auditory nerves which would have connected an essential part of the body to the brain. It has been feared by most people as it’s neither fully curable nor reversible and can often lead to full deafness if left untreated. That doesn’t stop those who suffer from this type of hearing loss, however, as specially-made hearing aids are available.\nSonoVive’s formula of ingredients and compounds was thoroughly tested and reviewed by a team medical and scientific professionals. All elements in this section, with the exception of one, have been organically sourced. The supplement was created in a GMP-certified (Good Manufacturing Practices), factory.\nEach ingredient has many positive effects on hearing and cognitive function. Let’s now take a closer look at each one.\n- Ginkgo Biloba\nGinkgo biloba, a Chinese herb medicine that has roots back to China, has been shown to improve brain function, memory and attention span. It improves the connectivity of neurons within the brain and allows for smoother neural transmissions. Gingko biloba essence is rich in nutrients that can be used to improve blood circulation and overall health.\n- St. John’s Wort\nAlso known by its scientific term ‘Hypericum perforatum’, the St. John’s wort flower produces a type of oil that’s enriched with anti-inflammatory properties. This extract aids in the relaxation of a wide range of muscles in the body as well as faster healing of wounds and bruises. It can reduce irritations from ear infections. It can soothe nerve functions, which is a useful addition for those who suffer from anxiety, depression, or other mental disorders. Book On Hearing Loss Cure\n- Bacopa Monnieri\nThe bacopa monnieri plant, known as Brahmi in India, has been used for centuries by Ayurvedic medical practitioners as a treatment for the improvement of cognitive functions and even further prevention of nerve ailments such as anxiety and epilepsy. It’s packed with an abundance of antioxidants and anti-inflammatory traits, both needed in nourishing brain cells. Bacopa monnieri can improve the condition of the auditory nerves that connect the brain to the ear.\nVinpocetine was originally developed as a chemical substitute for the extract found in the periwinkle plant and has been sold in Europe as a medical drug under the name Cavinton. Outside of Europe, it’s included as an ingredient in special dietary supplements that aim to improve brain function, like SonoVive, for instance, though it has yet to receive approval from the US FDA. Vinpocetine, despite being man-made and having a vague classification from established food or drug agencies, has strong neuroprotective components that could help to steer the brain away further damage. Apart from treating cognitive issues such as hearing loss and memory loss, its power as a nootropic substance can increase the blood from the brain to other parts of the body.\n- Huperzine A\nAn organically sourced chemical extracted from Chinese club moss, Huperzine A can cure users with ear infections along with a variety of hearing problems. It can improve the brain’s functions, helping users to think critically and make better decisions. It is unclear whether this element can bring positive attributes to other cognitive illnesses and issues such as Alzheimer’s disease, as there is not much scientific research so far about it. We do know that Huperzine A can be used to treat age-related issues. Book On Hearing Loss Cure\nL-glutamine is a type of amino acid that has a special role to stimulate the brain to produce neurotransmitters for silky smooth coordination between the brain and ears. Its properties can also aid in the development of stronger muscles. The body’s overall health is a key function of amino acids. Amino acids are building blocks. They look like stacks of bricks used in the construction of buildings. Amino acids offer the body a wide range of benefits, from heart and lung health to hair and nail regrowth.\nMyelin sheath protects the nerve cells of the brain that are interconnected. It is a fatty layer similar in appearance to an electrical cord, with all the wires inside. The myelin sheath can gradually lose its existence due to aging. This leaves nerve cells vulnerable. Phosphatidylserine, a fat-like substance, helps to replace the lost and thinned parts of the layer, further ensuring that nerve cell activities stay intact no matter what. The presence of phosphatidylserine is vital in maintaining the person’s hearing conditions as well as their overall brain health.\n- Acetyl L-Carnitine\nAcetyl L-carnitine is derived from L-carnitine and naturally occurs in the human body. It is responsible for converting fats into energy as part of a process called metabolism. Although the body already has enough acetyl L carnitine, it is known to have many nootropic benefits. It is used to treat a number of cognitive disorders, including Alzheimer’s disease and nerve pain in people with diabetes. It’s also known to treat those with depression thanks to its metabolic properties. There isn’t much research on acetyl Lcarnitine, but it can improve hearing and increase blood flow.\nSonoVive: The Benefits\nSonoVive’s specially formulated mix can provide those with hearing problems with a ton of major improvements from within the ears. Upon consistent regular use of this supplement, you may notice huge leaps in difference. For instance, you find yourself having a hard time listening to one of your close friends at first, even from far away. As you use SonoVive, you may slowly notice that your hearing has become crystal clear, and you would then be able to recognize your friend’s voice, particularly when both of you are a few more feet apart from each other. SonoVive may help you be more attentive to sounds and noises, no matter where you are.\nNatural factors such as age and irritation can lead to hearing loss. However, certain conditions or ailments may also contribute to the problem. SonoVive’s anti-inflammatory attributes serve a vital role in the reduction of further pain and discomfort from a wide variety of ear infections. Its antioxidant properties contributed by half of its ingredients also play a part in fixing hearing problems caused by oxidative stress. Your eardrum can also be affected by noise and other factors, such as wax buildup from trying to clean it with a Q-tip. Too much may result in damage and infections – thankfully, SonoVive has enough properties to prevent it from happening further. Book On Hearing Loss Cure\nA better sense of hearing means a more functioning brain system. SonoVive is known for its neuroprotective and nootropic properties. They can be used in many ways to improve the brain’s cognitive function. With SonoVive, you get to focus more attentively on your work, hobbies, and other activities without feeling lost then and there, remember past events as clear as day, and feel a stronger sense of whatever you love to do. A surge in mental health is also possible. Losing your hearing ability can lead to anxiety and depression. SonoVive’s ability to improve hearing and cognition lowers the risk of developing potentially deadly diseases like Alzheimer’s.\nMoreover, SonoVive also has other kinds of benefits in store, such as:\n- 100% safe formulation of ingredients with no trace of allergens such as soy and nuts\n- Supplements contain no toxic stimulants or risky ingredients that could put users at risk\n- Cost-effective pricing, with a range much more affordable than the otherwise expensive medical procedures and devices such as hearing aids\n- Stellar discounts and a 60-day risk-free refund policy\nSonoVive Side Effects\nSonoVive is safe and recommended for daily use. It should not cause any serious side effects. These side effects can only occur if the correct dosage is used.\nSonoVive uses only natural ingredients, with the exception of Vinpocetine. Although this substance is artificially manufactured, it still has the same properties and framework as the organic substitute in the Periwinkle plant. Therefore, it can be consumed in complete safety.\nHow to Use SonoVive\nSonoVive contains 30 capsules per bottle, and each is highly recommended to be taken once a day. Adults over 18 years old should take it. To ensure you’re taking the correct steps, consult your doctor if you have hearing issues or any other medical conditions such as diabetes or hypertension.\nFor any questions or doubts, you can always contact a physician or SonoVive’s hotline for advice. SonoVive can be used to treat hearing loss in one person, but it may not work for others due to the composition of its ingredients. It is not recommended for pregnant and actively breastfeeding women, as well as minors under the age of 18.\nThese are some other things you need to know if you decide to use SonoVive.\n- You must set a specific time of day that works best whenever you take the recommended dosage – you may opt to consume it after breakfast or lunch, for instance. You will see better results if you use it consistently.\n- Exceedive consumption of more than one capsule per daily may cause irritation in the ears or other parts of your body. Excess consumption of certain ingredients such as St. John’s wort extract, for example, may leave you more prone to sunburn.\n- SonoVive should not be used by people who are bleeding at high risk or take anticoagulant medications. These may interact with the product and may cause unpleasant reactions in the body.\n- You must discontinue taking SonoVive 2-3 weeks before your scheduled surgery or medical procedure, as it may cause excessive bleeding on your end.\n- Some of the supplement’s ingredients may potentially cause fertility issues, especially among men. SonoVive may not be recommended for you if you are trying to have a baby with your partner.\n- Results may vary from one person to another, so results might take a few weeks. Premeditated medical conditions, age, and lifestyle all play a role in the time it takes for your results to show. As much as possible, it’s best to wait at least three months to see them come to fruition.\nScientific Evidence: How Effective is It?\nSonoVive’s ingredients have been carefully considered and selected based on evidence from journals and studies published by prestigious universities and research centers. Rest assured that you’re in good hands, knowing that each element has proven to bring generally positive attributes to those who use it. Book On Hearing Loss Cure\nGinkgo biloba has been extensively researched and studied many times. Most of these studies have shown positive results. One journal specifically notes its cognitive benefits for those with mild memory impairments or Alzheimer’s disease.\nSt. John’s wort, on the other hand, has been found to have elements that may contribute to relieving the symptoms patients with depression and other related mental illnesses often experience. Studies in German-speaking regions have shown that the genetic structure of the flower can boost the production of dopamine and other positive neurotransmitters. This creates a placebo effect similar with antidepressant drugs. What makes St. John’s wort a little superior over the latter is that it creates fewer side effects.\nPrice range and where to buy\nYou may purchase the SonoVive dietary supplement from its official website at sonovive.com. There, you can select from the three packages below that Dr. Olson and his team take pride in offering. Free shipping is included in all available stocks, so you won’t have to worry much about the additional costs that may affect your wallet.\n- One bottle costs $69 each.\n- The cost of a three-bottle package is $177 with $59 per unit. This bundle saves you $120 compared to buying three quantities of the original price.\n- The six-bottle package is $294 and costs $49 each. Purchase six bottles at the original price and you can save $300.\nStill skeptical about its effectiveness? SonoVive comes with a guarantee money-back policy. If you are not satisfied with the results, you can return the bottles or get a refund. It’s only valid for 60 days after the initial purchase. If you ever conclude that the supplement doesn’t work for you, you can ask SonoVive’s contact services within the given timeframe.\nAfter taking a close and thorough inspection of SonoVive and what it could do to affect one’s hearing and cognitive processes, we have concluded that it is, indeed, an ideal choice as extra support for your ear and brain health. Though Dr. Sam Olson and his team have not yet fully proven its effectiveness as a supplement, they are confident that nearly all the ingredients mixed into its formulation can bring forth amazing benefits to the person’s way of living.\nSonoVive is organic, allergen-free and generally safe to use. While we are pleased with the product’s potential to deliver great results, it is not something you can rely on. You should also take precautions to prevent total hearing loss. Book On Hearing Loss Cure\nAre you convinced SonoVive could solve your hearing or thinking problems? You can decide for yourself!\nFAQ Book On Hearing Loss Cure\nHow is SonoVive made? Is it made in a safe facility?\nSonoVive capsules come mainly from nature and are further tested in the lab. They are then manufactured in an FDA-certified factory using secure and sterilized processes. Good Manufacturing Practices (GMPs), are used during manufacturing. This ensures that the product you receive is safe and secure.\nHow long should I continue taking SonoVive for?\nIt will depend on how severe a user’s condition is. If you are in good health, chances are the results might come to you within a minimum of a few weeks from first use. It may take six months, or longer, if it is not.\nApart from SonoVive, what else should I do to further prevent hearing problems?\nWe all know you shouldn’t fully rely on SonoVive to fix issues with your hearing, so you must take early precautions firsthand to prevent them until it gets worse. You must avoid loud noises and vibrations from hearing devices and speakers. Taking a break from using headphones or earphones is also a plus.

{"id": "973", "text": "The campfire isn’t just for roasting marshmallows or flipping burgers anymore. It’s also a great time for the adults to relax and have some fun with the best campfire drinking games around. These are a great way to cure the boredom of singing the same old campfire songs.\n1. Beer Pong: The infamous college drinking game that made its way to the wood burning fire pit. Items needed are beer, a long table, sleeves of plastic cups, and ping pong balls. Place ten cups filled half-way with beer and arranged in bowling pin style at both ends of the table. Each team or person is to stand at opposite ends of the table and make the ping pong ball into the opponent’s cups. If this happens, the opponent has to drink. If neither team or person makes it, reset and start again. The game is played until one team has consumed all the beverage in every cup.\n2. Cornhole: A new game using the classic bean bag. Items needed are beer or alcoholic beverage, two groupings of four like-colored bean bags, and two long wooden platforms that are raised slightly at one end with a hole just large enough for the bean bag. If a team or person makes a bean bag into the opponent’s hole the opponent has to drink. The rules can be altered to include knocking your opponent’s beanbag off the board or into the hole.\n3. Polish Horseshoes: This is a very challenging game, especially if you are already a little tipsy. Items needed are beer, two poles, empty beer bottles and a frisbee. Set the poles in the ground at opposite ends of the playing area and carefully balance the empty beer bottles on top. If a team knocks the bottle off the opposing side, the opponents have to drink. If one team saves a bottle from hitting the ground the opponents also have to drink.\n4. Dizzy Bat: A relay game that’s very entertaining to watch as well as participate. Items you will need are beer or alcoholic beverage and a bat. Each person has to chug their drink and rotate ten times with one bat end to the ground and the other end to their forehead. Run to the opposite end of your playing area and back then tagging your teammate to do the same thing. The first team to complete the relay are the winners.\n5. The Alphabet Game: A great game to bone up on the alphabet and get a little drunk. All you need is beer or an alcoholic beverage. Players will sit in a circle around the wood burning fire pit and determine a theme. For example, if the theme is cities then a player will say a city that starts with an “A” and so on down the alphabet. But, the next player in the circle has to remember all the cities from the prior players and add his own. The first player to forget a city or loses their place has to drink.\n6. I Went On A Picnic: The same rules apply as The Alphabet Game, only the player says the phrase, “I went on a picnic and I brought an item”. The item would correlate with the next letter of the alphabet. The next player would have to remember all the items the previous players brought to the picnic and add his own to the list. The first one to forget the list has to drink.\n7. I Never: This game is built on honesty and might be a little embarrassing. Items needed are beer or an alcoholic beverage and trust. One person says an “I Never” statement. For example, I’ve never swum naked. The people who’ve swum naked need to drink. Set a determined amount of rounds.\n8. Drinko: A game played like the famous Plinko. Items needed are five different drinks. Out of these drinks, two of them need to be a little gross and three of them can be delicious alcoholic beverages or beer, a slanted wooden board with a staggered peg system, ping pong balls, and a table. Line the five drinks down at the bottom of the board and the player drops the ping pong ball from the top of the board and down through the pegs. Whatever drink it lands in at the bottom is what the player chugs.\n9. Cup Swap: You have to have a steady hand in this game. Items needed are beer or an alcoholic beverage, plastic teaspoons, and a sleeve of plastic cups. Players will get two cups and one teaspoon. One cup will be empty and one filled with beer or alcoholic beverage. They’ll have one minute to spoon as much as they can out of the full cup and into the empty cup. What is left in the first cup with the beverage will have to be chugged at the end of the minute.\n10. Sip, Sip, Shot: A game that’s a take on the original Duck, Duck, Goose. Items needed are some insane campers and plenty of alcohol. Just sit in a circle around the campfire and let the fun begin!", "scores": {"score": 0, "score_transform_1": 0, "score_transform_2": 0, "score_transform_3": 1}}

{"id": "975", "text": "Having identified the name of a Sicilian immigrant ancestor, you’re prepared to search for records that may give his date of immigration and/or his date and place of birth. These may be contained in family records such as passports, marriage records, naturalization papers or membership documents of the mutual aid societies, or Società di Mutuo Soccorso that were so common in America for Sicilian immigrants.\nIf these records aren’t available in your family, and if you know the approximate date of the ancestor’s death, check municipal and county libraries for archives of local newspapers that can be searched for obituaries, death notices or articles of the period, which may give information about your ancestor.\nIf you know where the family settled when first in America, visit the County Clerk’s office in that jurisdiction, and ask to see any naturalization records they may have on file for members of your family. Naturalization papers, especially the Petition for Naturalization, can have a wealth of information, including the immigrant’s name, birth date and place, date and ship of immigration, the address of the applicant and the names and dates of birth of each member of his family.\nStill no luck? Then it’s time to turn to US and/or state Census records. The first US Federal Census was in 1790, under Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson. There have been 22 since then, taken at ten-year intervals. The last was in 2010. Censuses from 1790 through 1940 are available in hard copy at many sources, including local libraries and genealogical societies, except for the 1890 census, most of which was destroyed by fire. For privacy reasons, federal censuses are not released to the public until 72 years after they are made, making 1940 the most recent census available. You must know the community your family lived in during a given period, then search for the census or censuses that fall into that period.\nThe census questions varied over the years, from simple identification and place of residence in 1790, to much more detailed information in later versions. Below is a list of questions from a typical US census, that of 1920, near the peak of Sicilian immigration to America:\n• Relationship to head of family\n• Age at last birthday\n• Marital status\n• If foreign born, year of immigration to the U.S., if naturalized and year of such\n• School attendance\n• Birthplace of person and parents [usually the country only]\n• If foreign-born, the native tongue\n• Ability to speak English\n• Occupation, industry, and class of worker\n• Was home owned or rented: if owned, was it mortgaged\nIf you find your ancestor listed in such a census, you’ll find his immigration date and nationality, and be able to estimate his birth year by subtracting his age from the year of the census. Consider all dates approximate. They were not backed by documentation, but simply by the statement of the interviewee. Most libraries with hard copies of censuses cover only the city or county where the library is located.\nIf your ancestor settled elsewhere, before the advent of the internet, you would have had to go to that place to search the census, or pay a local researcher to do it for you. Luckily, all US Federal Censuses through 1940 are now searchable and viewable on-line.", "scores": {"score": 3, "score_transform_1": 5, "score_transform_2": 5, "score_transform_3": 0}}

{"id": "981", "text": "Orange County Kidnapping Crime Attorney\nChances are, if you’re arrested for kidnapping, the prosecutor will seek harsh penalties and care little for your side of the story. Charges of kidnapping can apply to many situations you are not aware of, such as taking your own child away. Most defendants have no idea how they were breaking the law until they land in a jail cell.\nWe understand that lines can be blurry and sometimes you end up on the wrong end of a misunderstanding. Facing charges of kidnapping can be stressful, with severe implications on your personal and professional lives. If you're being accused of kidnapping, call Law Office of Michael L. Guisti at (714) 530-9690 or toll-free at (888) 478-8999 for experienced legal representation to help keep you out of jail. Our attorneys are here to help.\nKidnapping is defined by Penal Code (PC) 207 as the use of force or fear to take a person and move that person a \"substantial distance.\" This can include cases in custody disputes where one parent removes a child from the care of another who does not have the legal right to do so. Especially in cases involving parents accused of kidnapping their own children, the lines can be blurry and a good defense can successfully dismiss charges or reduce penalties.\nIn order to be convicted of the crime of kidnapping, a prosecutor must prove the following:\n- You detained another person by means force or fear\n- By using that force and/or fear, you moved the other person a \"substantial distance\"\n- You were not within your legal right to custodianship\nWhat is considered a \"substantial distance?\"\nA \"substantial distance\" under PC 207 is a distance more than slight or trivial. However, you can still be tried and convicted of kidnapping if the movement increased the risk of physical or psychological harm, provided the opportunity to commit additional crimes, and/or decreased the likelihood of being caught.\nWhile Penal Code 207 outlines the broad definition of kidnapping charges, there are also individual charges for specific scenarios. A common one is parental kidnapping, which can occur when one parent takes the child without the permission of the other parent, violating a custody agreement. Violating a court-ordered custody agreement is breaking the law and can lead to serious consequences: a charge of child abduction or Penal Code 278.5. This can occur whether a parent refuses to return a child to the other parent when they have joint custody or whether a parent refuses to allow the other parent to have court-ordered visitation time. In order to convict you, the prosecution must prove that:\n- You attempted to “maliciously deprive” another parent of the child by luring or taking the child away;\n- The child was under the age of 18;\n- You did not have a right to custody at that time; and\n- You intended to detain or hide the custody from the other parent.\nHowever, there is an exception to this law. If the detaining parent believed that the other parent abused the child, then he or she could violate the custody agreement to protect the child so long as that parent contacted the proper authorities, including the district attorney, and filed for custody under the Parental Kidnapping Prevention Act and Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act.\nAnother common kidnapping charge is aggravated kidnapping, which applies when:\n- The alleged victim suffers a great bodily injury while detained.\n- The alleged victim is kidnapped during a carjacking.\n- The alleged victim was under the age of 14 and the crime involved force, fear, or fraud.\n- The kidnapping involved a ransom demand.\nAggravated kidnapping is punished with an extensive prison sentence. In all cases, you should not hesitate to contact a skilled attorney who can explain your situation and advocate for the lightest possible sentence for you.\nThe penalties for kidnapping are extremely serious. Under California’s Three Strikes Law, kidnapping can result in a strike on your criminal record, and you may be required to served 85% of your sentence. Kidnapping is also a crime of moral turpitude, meaning it can affect your immigration status. In most cases, it is a felony. The specific penalties include:\n- Kidnapping: Up to three, five, or eight years in a California state prison and/or a fine of $10,000.\n- Aggravated Kidnapping: Up to five, eight, or eleven years in a California state prison and/or a fine of $10,000.\n- Parental Kidnapping/Child Abduction: Up to one year in an Orange County jail and/or a fine of $1,000 if charged as a misdemeanor, or up to two, three, or four years in a California state prison and/or a fine of $10,000 if charged as a felony.\nIf you are granted probation, the court requires that you serve at least one year in a county jail.\nThere are many scenarios in which an alleged kidnapping can be fought. An attorney at Law Office of Michael L. Guisti can help formulate a defense pertinent to your specific case and fight to reduce your criminal charges. Let us guide you through the legal process, represent you in and out of court, and provide you with the best possible options to make this complicated time much easier for you.\nIn our experience, a strong defense against kidnapping charges may be that:\n- You were falsely accused.\n- You had not traveled a substantial distance.\n- The alleged victim freely and voluntarily went with you.\n- You were coerced by another individual to kidnap someone.\n- You misunderstood the custody agreement, or you did not have a court-ordered custody agreement.\n- You had lawful custody over your child.\n- The other parent lost his/her parental right to custody or abused your child.\nLaw Office of Michael L. Guisti has successfully represented clients all over Southern California in cases of alleged kidnapping.

{"id": "984", "text": "A Natural Order Exists\nThe increasing emphasis in Judaism on esoteric Kabbalistic cosmologies that basically negate the existence of the Universe by morphing it into God has tended to suppress any beliefs in a scientific order to the Universe.\nThere are many valid Torah sources that emphasize the existence of a natural order that most Jews are subjected to. Regrettably there seems to be a trend in the last few hundred years to ignore or suppress such viewpoints.\n\"...the majority of the Israelite nation save an elite few, without a doubt are under the control of nature and the heavenly forces...similar to other living creatures who are not subject to God's providence individually, but only in terms of their species...\" (Sforno, commentary on Leviticus 13:47)\n\"Hashem wants the natural order to remain functional...he thus allows idol-worshippers to naturally prosper in their idol worship, and even a righteous saint might be impoverished and afflicted, if nature so imposes.\" (Maharal, Commentary on the Pesach Haggada, at the word \"Hallelukah\")\nA belief that most Jews are subjected to the natural order does not in any way have to promote atheism or negation of belief in Hashem’s providence over the world. On the contrary, the very existence of life in this world including man’s own existence depends very much on an intelligent Creator performing an enormous level of fine tuning of the physical laws and constants to allow us to exist.\nTraditional Judaism placed a strong emphasis on a person’s requirement to guard their lives from random or natural misfortunes. The earlier rabbis, unlike many of the Kabbalistic “preachers” nowadays, believed that most people are subject to the natural order. This citation from Sefer Hachinuch sums it up well:\n\"To remove obstacles and misfortunes from our surroundings, on this (Torah) says to make a guard-rail around your roof...so that no one will fall there...on this we say to make a wall and a fence near every obstacle. Hashem directs all the matters of man, and everything good or evil that He degrees is based on man's merit or guilt...even so man must guard himself from all the random occurrences in this world because God built a world based on Nature, and decreed that fire burns and water extinguishes the flames...God gave man daas to guard himself from injuries...man is obligated to use his wisdom to guard himself from random occurrences...the majority of mankind in their sins do not merit a great deliverance, so the Torah commanded them to guard their surroundings so that random deaths don't occur...whoever relies on a miracle then a miracle won't be done for them etc etc.\" (Sefer HaChinuch, Parshas Ki Tsetseh, Mitzvah 538)", "scores": {"score": 3, "score_transform_1": 5, "score_transform_2": 5, "score_transform_3": 0}}

{"id": "987", "text": "You may have heard us say at some point that there is no such thing as a trading holy grail. What we mean by this is that there are no trading approaches or systems that are 100% effective, allowing you to extract money from the markets at will and without risk (btw, if they did exist, no one would let you know about it).\nSo….if you come across someone promising a fool-proof system to follow, our advice is to run.\nThe only thing that is certain in trading is that it is uncertain. So, as traders, the best we can do is to subjectively define risk/reward based on hypotheses in the auction. Fortunately, since financial market fluctuations are based on human behavior, we can develop approaches to markets that have some degree of predictability.\nWhen we statistically extract these behaviors, we can even create probabilities around behavior, allowing us to quantify the success of our trading ideas. We believe that if we can wrap a probability around the success of an outcome, that is an edge that we can use. It’s not a holy grail, but it is something that we can lean on.\nTo illustrate, see this chart. What it tells us is that over the last 1000 trading sessions in Nasdaq futures there are behaviors that we can see with respect to the price range of the 1st hour of trade (we profile traders call this the “initial balance”.) Here’s what we learn:\n- 408 out of 1000 sessions we only extended the initial balance higher\n- 306 out of 1000 sessions we only extended the initial balance lower\n- 230 out of 1000 sessions we extended the initial balance in both directions\n- 56 out of 1000 sessions we didn’t extend initial balance at all\nSo, from these results we can ask some interesting questions that will hopefully create some “aha” moments for you:\n- 70% (408+306/1000=70%) of the time, when Nasdaq futures extend the initial balance, they only extend it in one direction. So, if you see range extension in one direction, what does that mean for the rest of the session?\n- 5.6% of the time, Nasdaq futures remain completely inside their initial balance. So, if you are sitting at your screen and you see Nasdaq sitting inside the first hour range, what’s the likelihood that it will remain there?\nThis is just a start of the types of thinking that is possible when you begin to wrap statistics around your trading. Hopefully, this spurs some ideas that you didn’t have before. BTW, these types of statistics can be pulled for any trading vehicle: stocks, futures, forex.\nIt’s not a holy grail, and it’s not certain, but when we can quantify the likelihood of something happening, that is an edge. As traders, that’s the best we can do.\nJosh & the TWP team\nps. We reserve some slots each week to offer free 30 min consults with traders. They are first come/first serve.

{"id": "988", "text": "I hope your read the post I just made under talks. This is an extension of that talk to help inspire a desire for the daily rosary. We need to remind ourselves of its power and we need to plainly be obedient to Our good Queen and Mother.\nHere are the facts:\nThe Power of the Rosary\n\"The most holy Virgin in these last times in which we live has given a new efficacy to the recitation of the Rosary to such an extent that there is no problem, no matter how difficult it is, whether temporal or, above all, spiritual, in the personal life of each one of us, of our families, of the families of the world, or of the religious communities, or even of the life of peoples and nations, that cannot be solved by the Rosary. There is no problem, I tell you, no matter how difficult it is, that we cannot resolve by the prayer of the holy Rosary. With the holy Rosary, we will save ourselves; we will sanctify ourselves; we will console our Lord, and obtain the salvation of many souls.\" Conversation between Sr. Lucy of Fatima and Fr. Fuentes, Dec. 26, 1957\n\"The Rosary is a powerful weapon to put the demons to flight and to keep oneself from sin…If you desire peace in your hearts, in your homes, and in your country, assemble each evening to recite the Rosary. Let not even one day pass without saying it, no matter how burdened you may be with many cares and labors.\" Pope Pius XI\n\"Among all the devotions approved by the Church, none has been so favored by so many miracles as the Rosary devotion.\" Pope Pius IX\n\"The Rosary is the most excellent form of prayer and the most efficacious means of attaining eternal life. It is the remedy for all our evils, the root of all our blessings. There is no more excellent way of praying.\" Pope Leo XIII\nSt. Dominic prayed to Our Lady that she would force the devils who possessed a man to reveal the truth about devotion to Her. The devils were forced by Our Lady to reveal: \"Now that we are forced to speak we must also tell you this: Nobody who perseveres in saying the Rosary will be damned, because she obtains for her servants the grace of true contrition for their sins and by means of this they obtain God's forgiveness and mercy.\"\nSome Important Miracles of the Rosary\nOf course we know that the Rosary is miraculous. We can see it in our own lives. This should give us great incentive to cling to our Blessed Mother and pray Her Rosary. She will ultimately lead us to Her Son - Her one goal! And finally to our salvation. Below are some very big miracles that should give America hope for \"a cleaning of the swamp\". We need our Republic back and we pray that Our Lady will help this country come back to God and lawfulness and be a beacon for the rest of the world.\nBattle of Lepanto, 1571 - On Sunday, October 7, the Christian and Turkish fleets met in Lepanto Gulf, off the coast of Greece. The bitter battle finished with a brilliant victory of the Christians who where vastly outnumbered. That very evening Pope St. Pius V had at Rome a clear knowledge of this success. The same afternoon, the Confraternities of the Rosary, particularly in Rome, had marched through the streets in procession reciting the Rosary. This victory put an end to the naval power of the Turks and saved Christian Europe. To this day this victory has been attributed to the praying of the Rosary. The feast of “The Most Holy Rosary” is celebrated on October 7 now and the month of October is dedicated to the Most Holy Rosary.\nRosary Miracle at Hiroshima - August 6th, 1945 There was a home eight blocks (about 1 kilometer) from where the A-Bomb went off in Hiroshima Japan. This home had a church attached to it which was completely destroyed, but the home survived, and so did the eight German Jesuit missionaries who prayed the rosary in that house faithfully every day. These men were missionaries to the Japanese people, they were non-military, but because Germany and Japan were allies during WWII they were permitted to live and minister within Japan during the war. Not only did they all survive with (at most) relatively minor injuries, but they all lived well past that awful day with no radiation sickness, no loss of hearing, or any other visible long term defects or maladies. Naturally, they were interviewed numerous times (Fr. Schiffer, a survivor, said over 200 times) by scientists and health care people about their remarkable experience and they say \"we believe that we survived because we were living the message of Fatima. We lived and prayed the rosary daily in that home.\" Of course the secular scientists are speechless and incredulous at this explanation - and they are sure there is some \"real\" explanation - but at the same time over 55 years later the scientists are still absolutely bamboozled when it comes to finding a plausible scenario to explain the missionaries’ unique escape from the hellish power of that bomb.\nRussians Pullout of Austria, 1948 - After World War ll, the Allies turned over Catholic Austria to communist Russia. For three years the Austrian people endured this tyranny. Then, a Franciscan priest, Father Petrus, remembered how the Christians although greatly outnumbered had defeated the Turks at the Battle of Lepanto through the Rosary, and he launched a Rosary crusade. Through it 70,000 people, one tenth of the Austrian population, pledged to say the Rosary daily for the Soviets to leave their country. Austria was valuable to the Russians because of its strategic location, rich mineral deposits and oil reserves. Yet on May 13, 1955, the anniversary of the first apparition of Our Lady at Fatima, the Russians signed the agreement to leave Austria, and they did so without one person being killed and without one shot being fired. It is the only time that the militant atheistic forces of Marxism have ever peacefully left a country in which they held power. Military strategists and historians are baffled as to why the Russians pulled out. But we are not - it was the power of the Rosary.\nThe Country That Saved Itself - Brazil 1962 - In 1962 there was a looming threat of communist takeover in Brazil. A woman there named Dona Amelia Bastos was known to have formed a Rosary rally among the Brazilian women there to do their part in opposing the looming threat. Their goal was simply to pray the Rosary in large groups asking the Virgin Mary for help in opposing the Communist takeover which the President of Brazil was leaning toward at the time. In Belo Horizonte 20,000 women reciting the rosary aloud broke up a Communist rally. In Sao Paulo, 600,000 women praying the rosary in one of the most moving demonstrations in Brazilian history, caused the President of Brazil to flee the country and not a single death was encountered, sparing the country from Communist takeover.\nBernadette Porter is a Traditional Catholic, a wife of 42 years with 6 adult home-schooled children and 6 grandchildren.

{"id": "991", "text": "Southern Utah is high on my list of places to get outside. With endless red-rock vistas and deep, scenic canyons, all under a deep blue sky, you’ll be hard-pressed to find anywhere else with such beautiful terrain. There are so many stunning outdoor landscapes to see in Utah that it almost makes the rest of the 49 states seem like underachievers. And much of the wonder is in the southern portion of the state.\nWe found quite a few towns that had more than their share of gorgeous scenery and fun things to do. A road trip spent driving the highways of southern Utah is a road trip you’ll remember; just as much for the landscape as for the towns and people you’ll come across. This area is unspoiled, and much of it off the beaten path, so unless you’re going at the height of tourist season, you won’t find places crawling with people.\nSouthern Utah is almost a year-round destination, although, because I’m not a heat-lover, I don’t think I’d go in July or August. In winter, the temperatures were moderate and the crowds non-existent. Just keep an eye on the snow forecast. Spring and fall are also great times to visit. Here are some of our favorite southern Utah small towns, in no particular order.\nSome of this information was obtained during a press trip. All opinions are my own.\n1. St. George\nSt. George is stunning. This city of about 85,000 may not technically be a small town but has a small-town feel. It’s convenient as a home base to some of Utah’s best national parks and has its own quite fabulous state park. This area of southern Utah is some of the prettiest country I’ve seen in the entire U.S.\nIf you’re into visiting national parks like I am, you’ll be pleased to know that St. George is only an hour south of Zion National Park and just a little farther from Bryce Canyon National Park.\nGetting to St. George is fairly easy. Many people take advantage of the St. George Regional Airport, which offers service from major airlines like United, American, and Delta. We decided to fly into Las Vegas and make the 2-hour drive north for our visit. One of the highlights of this drive is passing through the incredible Virgin River Gorge.\nMy favorite way to spend time in St. George is outside. Pioneer Park has 52 acres of rock-climbing opportunities just waiting to be explored. After you’re done climbing, take a look around St. George’s historical features. Since the city was founded by members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, you’ll be able to visit many church-related sites. Top of the list is the Brigham Young Winter Residence Historical Site, which is open 7 days a week. Also a must-see is the St. George Tabernacle.\nI recently spent an incredible 2 days at Red Mountain Resort in Ivins. This serene wellness retreat has everything for your body, mind, and soul and is set amid a jaw-dropping location in gorgeous Ivins, Utah. Technically a suburb of St. George, Ivins is home to world-class spas and plenty of ways to have fun outdoors.\nSnow Canyon State Park is a jewel and has accessibility right out the back doors of Red Mountain Resort. Snow Canyon easily competes with many of the national parks I’ve been to and might even be a national park itself were it not in a state that already has an incredible collection of five national parks. This 7,000+ acre state park offers miles of hiking trails, biking trails, and popular e-bike rentals located right on the outskirts of the park. Snow Canyon State Park is gloriously beautiful with sights seemingly around every corner. You’ll enjoy the almost 40 miles of hiking trails and 3 miles of paved walking and biking trails.\nYou may recognize Snow Canyon State Park as it’s been a favorite location for filmmakers. Westerns like Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, The Electric Horseman, and Jeremiah Johnson were all shot at least partly on location here.\nPro Tip: If you book a stay at Red Moutain Resort, ask about the airport shuttle that will take you to the resort so you won’t need a rental car.\nRight outside the west entrance of Zion National Park is the cute town of Springdale. With a population of less than 1,000, Springdale is a small town with a surprising number of good, local restaurants.\nWe enjoyed an excellent dinner al fresco at Oscar’s Cafe. With homemade Mexican specialties, indoor and outdoor seating, and a casual vibe, this homey spot is a winner. I tried the salmon filet served on a bed of rice. The simple salmon was cooked to perfection. I could eat the accompanying stuffed poblano pepper daily. The pepper, filled with delicious cheddar mashed potatoes, corn, cilantro, onion, and red pepper mixture, is incredible.\nAnother fun restaurant is the Bit and Spur. This restaurant and bar serves inventive southwestern cuisine and specialty margaritas, including my favorite prickly pear, as well as made-in-Utah spirits. Springdale is the perfect place to stay if you’re visiting Zion and the shuttle system in town lets you leave your car at the hotel and let them do the driving.\nPro Tip: The Sol Foods Supermarket has a great deli. Try their soups.\nKanab isn’t as well-known as some of the neighboring towns, and that’s a good thing. This town, home to about 5,000, is in the heart of some of the best outdoor adventures in the state. For starters, there are three national parks within a 3-hour drive: Zion, Bryce, and the North Rim of the Grand Canyon. Plus, Kanab is known as the gateway to the super popular The Wave.\nBut the town also has its attractions including one of the most amazing animal sanctuaries in the U.S. — Best Friends. This organization works to save thousands of animals every year. At their Kanab location, you can participate in tours of the facility or take an adorable pup for a walk. They also have activities for the kids.\nCoral Pink Sand Dunes State Park is an amazing place to explore on foot or by ATV. Almost 90 percent of the dunes are open for riding so you’re sure to find a thrilling area. Kanab is just an hour and a half from St. George Regional Airport or 3 hours from Las Vegas.\nTwo hours north of Kanab, tiny Escalante is home to the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument. If you’re looking for a vast, rugged, remote area where you can find solitude, this is your place. The monument is not nearly as popular as some of the nearby national parks, so you won’t see as many visitors and you might not see any people for hours, depending on when you go.\nOne of the most popular things to do here is to check out Peek-A-Boo Slot Canyon. If you’re into photography, the changing light here makes for incredible shots. The location of the canyon is off the beaten path, so many people prefer to go with a local guide. There are also plenty of hiking trails to explore as well as unique, otherworldly terrain.\nPro Tips: While there are roads through the park, most are not paved, and many aren’t suitable for two-wheel-drive vehicles or RVs. This is a very large, very remote area with few services and no cell service for the most part. Make sure you’re prepared and stocked up on essentials (and gas). And it’s always a good idea to share your itinerary with friends so someone knows your plan.", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

These unique traditions & customs are flourishing and evolving, and I wanted to document these particularly British individuals exactly as they are without further embellishment.\nI decided that the best way to record this was to concentrate on the individuals rather than the perimeter events, working within a portable studio at each event, to link each event and the photographs together.\nMy starting point was the Victorian Member of Parliament and amateur photographer Sir Benjamin Stone’s series of photographs within ‘Records of National Life and History Volume I: Festivals, Ceremonies and Customs’ and the collection of his photographs at the V&A Museum.\nThe initial idea of a new 21st century British folklore portrait came from a discussion with my friend Simon Costin, designer and the director of the Museum of British Folklore, who is campaigning to raise funds and awareness for the UK’s first museum to exclusively cover British Folklore. In 2009, Simon Costin took a miniature Museum of British Folklore around the UK in an elaborately styled 1960’s caravan as part of the Museums journey towards a permanent home. Initially I accompanied him along with my portable studio and then went on both alone and with Simon to other events around the UK. He has been an integral part of the photographic project, suggesting events and sharing his contacts, enthusiasm and passion for British folklore. The project has been in collaboration with Simon, whose help and knowledge has been invaluable.\n‘The Endless Cavalcade’(by Alexander Howard published in 1964) lists a British rite or ritual for every day of the year, there are now approximately 720 recorded events, rites and ever changing customs practiced in the UK each year.\nBy no means are the photographs in Arcadia Britannica intended to be a comprehensive document of British Folklore today, but merely a snapshot of a small number of the individuals involved today and the photography for the project continues.\nWho are the people behind the images?\nThe people behind the images come from all walks of life including; nurses, builders, a Japanese translator, civil servants, business people, and the graphic designer of Hibernian football club, amongst others. A complete cross section of backgrounds and occupations appear within British Folklore. Wherever possible we captioned the subject’s professions within Arcadia Britannica.\nWhat is about British folklore culture that fascinates you?\nToday we find ourselves in the midst of a British folklore renaissance, a new surge of interest in all things folkloric, within music, art and fashion. There is a growing popular desire to reconnect with our heritage, nature and our environment, perhaps as a reaction against our on-line, yet impersonal technological age. British Folklore traditions and rituals have had a rather tame reputation to date, which is unfounded. There is a fascinating world of bizarre tales and characters, brimming with idiosyncrasies and eccentricities, together with a renewed modern 21st century populism and enthusiasm, coupled with British history and myth. Folklore is a living, evolving culture that doesn’t stand still; it adapts and references contemporary culture.\nWould you consider expanding your project in other countries?\nYes absolutely, many of these British rituals have similarities to those in Germany, France, Scandinavia, and many other countries and although mostly, the origins are unclear these events must have important links to one another. But for now I am concentrating on the UK as there is still so much still to cover here.\nDo you think rituals are still important within the modern society or is it part of our heritage that is slowly fading away?\nYes, ritual is still important and I think we find it reassuring. It enables us to both re-connect with the past and connect with the present.\nDo you think this is something that can evolve and take new forms in order to adjust with today’s needs?\nBy its nature Folklore’s origins are usually unclear and ever changing, adapting to contemporary society. Its current popularity could be a reaction to our consumerist age; it celebrates renewal, nature, and green environmental issues, all of which are thoroughly modern concerns.\nThe Jack in the Green festival in Hastings is a good example of the evolution of a folklore event; first recorded around 300 years ago as a May Day celebration of the start of summer in Hastings, its roots are probably from the Romans and Celts celebrations of the beginning of summer. The Jack in the Green parade had all but disappeared by the start of the 20th Century. It was resurrected in 1983 and today is an ever-popular annual event with some new traditions as well as the old. Along with the traditional costumes (people dressed as milkmaids and chimney sweeps) there are new contemporary participants, often dressed in extravagant ‘tatter’ clothing decorated with foliage and flowers, and their faces painted green.\nEven the Bonfire society’s Sussex bonfire celebrations have evolved. Guy Fawkes Night, that commemorates the events of the 5 November 1605, when Guy Fawkes, a member of the Gunpowder Plot, was arrested whilst guarding explosives that his fellow plotters had placed beneath the Houses of Parliament in London.\nIn celebration of King James’ survival of this attempt on his life, bonfires were lit around London. In 1850 in Lewes, the inclusion of the burning of a papal effigy began on Guy Fawkes Night, in protest at Pope Pius IX’s decision to try to restore the Catholic Church in England. In Lewis and Hastings today, it has become a fun night out, Papal effigies have been replaced by effigies of currently unpopular figures, usually politicians, along with the traditional Guy Fawkes.\nThe annual Notting Hill London carnival is an example of a modern Folkloric event that is relevant to both the local and, more recently, a widespread London community that celebrates Caribbean London culture.\nWhat is it about masquerade that captures your attention? I can see this is something that dominates your photographs both in your personal work but also in projects for clients such as Hermes.\nEscaping from the ‘everyday’, disguise, dressing up, the taking on of another identity, fantasy, and hiding!\nAre you working on a new project at the moment?\nI have several projects on the go, one of which involves tracing and photographing my long lost family of Native American distant relatives that live in Canada, and the surrounding landscape and towns nearby.\nMelissanthi Spei is an Athenian born fashion artist based in London. Her heritage in combination with her creativity inspires her to create contemporary and sculptural garments. Part of her identity as a designer is to use industrial materials for something historical and old through the exploration of traditional arts and crafts and their projection to contemporary aesthetics.

An investment needs to earn a return that compensates for the risk.\nThe risk of a capital investment will vary according to factors such as:\nLength of the project\nThe longer the project, the greater the risk that estimated revenues, costs and cash flows prove unrealistic\nSource of the data\nAre estimated project profits and cash flows based on detailed research, gut feel, or a little of both?\nThe size of the investment\nAn investment that uses a substantial proportion of the available business funds is, by definition, more risky than a smaller project. Risk is also about the consequences to the business if something goes wrong!\nThe economic and market environment\nA major issue for most large investments\nMost projects will make assumptions about demand, costs, pricing etc which can become wildly inaccurate through changing market and economic conditions\nThe experience of the management team\nA project in a market in which the management team has strong experience is a lower-risk proposition than one in which the business is taking a step into the unknown!\nQualitative influences on investment appraisal\nAn investment decision is not just about the numbers. A spread sheet calculation for NPV or ARR might suggest a particular decision, but management also need to take account of qualitative issues such as:\n- The impact on employees\n- Product quality and customer service\n- Consistency of the investment decision with corporate objectives\n- The business' brand and image, including reputation\n- Implications for production and operations, including any disruption or change to the existing set-up\n- A business' responsibilities to society and other external stakeholders\nQuantitative influences on investment appraisal\nThe investment appraisal comes up with a result, but how is a decision made?\nMany firms set what are known as \"investment criteria\" against which they judge investment projects.\nA problem with the three main investment appraisal methods is that they can generate seemingly contradictory results. For example, an investment might have a long payback period because the returns only occur several years into the project (possibly too long to be acceptable). However, if those returns are significant to the original investment, it is likely that the NPV or ARR would suggest going ahead.\nThe use of investment criteria is intended to help guide management through these decisions and address the potential conflicts.\nSo possible criteria might suggest only accepting investment proposals which meet at least two of the following:\n- A payback within four years\n- ARR of at least 20%, with no profits taken into account beyond Year 5\n- NPV of at least 25% of the initial investment", "scores": {"score": 4, "score_transform_1": 5, "score_transform_2": 5, "score_transform_3": 0}}

{"id": "1006", "text": "You may have a small child who just cannot wait to begin playing! As well as the clarinet, which is a good instrument for smaller hands to begin on, we have the Alphasax.\nThe Alphasax is made by Trevor James. It has fewer notes at the top and bottom, retaining just over two octaves from low C up to top D (plenty to be going on with for a learner). The reduction in metal keywork makes the instrument 33% lighter as well as needing less hand stretch to reach the lowest notes, and fewer palm keys at the top to avoid catching with your left hand. It also has the fantastic advantage of sounding just like a standard alto sax.\nThe Alphasax weighs just 1.86 kg (an average alto weighs about 2.19kg) which is significantly lighter. The case supplied with an Alphasax is also lightweight, which is an ergonomic backpack design, weighing just 3.34kg complete with instrument.\nAs well as small children, some adults prefer to go for the the Alphasax too if they experience neck pain or suffer rheumatic pains in the hands. This is good news indeed for those of us wanting to keep playing into a ripe old age, as playing music is a fabulous way of helping to maintain both physical and mental well-being.\nWe always have them in stock. The standard Alpha comes in gold lacquer. For the little princess in your family there is the baby pink version with lovely silver keywork, which we also carry in stock. Or, for a very stylish alternative, we have Alphasaxes in black with gold keywork.\nHere are some saxes typically held in stock, please note our stock level fluctuates daily so just drop us a line if you have a particular sax in mind and we will check our stock for you.\nArtemis or Bauhaus soprano (curved to look like an alto sax) saxophone\nNew pro Yanagisawa SC991 soprano (curved to look like an alto sax) saxophone\nThese saxophones are ideal for children too small to play an Alphasax or alto sax. As you can see from the photograph, the look is the same with the curve both in the neck and the bell. However with the size difference, the weight is significantly reduced.\nThough the positioning of the keys is identical to a standard alto sax, most small hands can reach to play the notes. Those in the furthest position, and therefore the most difficult to reach (typically bottom B and B flat) these are rarely used in entry-level music books so this doesn't tend to be a problem at an early stage.", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}
{"id": "1007", "text": "Either you are a startup or a big brand, there’s no chance that you aren’t on social media in any course of action.\nBut, are you making the most out of social media for your brand?\nIf not, keep reading!\nAccording to Statista, more than 3.5 billion people are using social media worldwide, and it’s expected to rise in the coming years.\nMost successful marketers adopt strategies that create brand awareness, drive leads, and boost the conversion rate via social media.\nLet’s look at the top 10 ways through which you can improve your social media presence.\nBuild Up Multi-Channel Approach\nThere are a plethora of social media platforms, and choosing the best one for your brand can be a bit difficult.\nUsually, people prefer to select only one social platform, but no one can predict which will surpass the other in the future.\nFocusing on one social media network can be dangerous; instead, marketers should strategize in such a manner that they can use different platforms for distinct purposes.\nFrom the industry experts, you’ll receive advice to sign up your brand on Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, and Twitter (and no other).\nIn case you are a graphic designer, then Behance is one of the best platforms to showcase your work.\nTherefore, you’ve to pick your platform as per your profession, products, and services.\nTip: If you want to generate leads for your business, I suggest opting for Facebook and LinkedIn advertising.\nFor instance, Mailchimp (an email marketing platform) posts case studies on how their customers generated high ROI with email marketing.\nBoth marketers and business owners use Facebook daily, and Mailchimp knows brands need email marketing to reach their audience.\nFrom the above example, we can conclude that the objective of marketing plays a crucial role in choosing the social media channel.\nEstablish A Unique Brand Identity\nWith millions of businesses active on social media, you need to create a unique and compelling brand identity.\nMostly, people reevaluate the brands’ Facebook cover photo, content, and activities on their feeds.\nAnd, if your activities appear like another brand, you’ll experience negative marketing among your followers.\nI suggest prioritizing things, such as color theme, content, and bio for your brand’s social media page via prioritization tools.\nFor example, JetBlue, an airline company, shares several flying photos on its Instagram handle.\nYou might be wondering, “What’s unique in that?”\nWell, they’ve created a hashtag #WingCrushWednesday, where they share user-generated content that includes a part of JetBlue’s airplane wing in the post.\nIt inspires the customers to post the same as their photos may get shared on JetBlue’s official page.\nLike any other aspect of a business, you first need market research to create an exceptional brand identity.\nEngage with Your Audience Constantly\nBuilding an excellent reputation on social media is a bit of a challenging task. And to establish it, you need to increase engagement with your audience regularly.\nIt will not only forge a trustful relationship between you and your audience but also increase your organic reach.\nTo engage with your followers, you can follow the methods below:\n- Reply to comments on your post.\n- Share user-generated content.\n- Acknowledge followers for participating in contests.\n- Providing value-addition information.\n- Clarify the queries of your audience.\n- Respond to DMs quickly.\nFor example, Burt’s Bees interacts on Twitter by replying to their customers’ compliments – just to make them feel special.\nBy doing so, your followers don’t see you only as a business, but they’ll also respect your brand as you care for their feedback.\nPro Tip: To grow on social media exponentially – connect, increase engagement by posting at the right time, and build relationships with your audience regularly.\nLeverage Lookalike Audience Through Paid Ads\nOrganic reach on social media is declining day-by-day. On Facebook, the average organic reach to page likes is 5.20% only.\nTherefore, if you want to create brand awareness, you have to benefit from the lookalike audience strategy.\nSocial media platforms let you create lookalike audiences that connect you with people who have similar interests to your ideal customer.\nFor instance, upload a .csv file consisting of name, email addresses, or other personal information to Facebook.\nAfterward, Facebook will automatically identify the audience based on similar interests, behaviors, and demographics.\nNow, you can run ads to drive the audience to your Facebook business page or website.\nSeveral platforms, including LinkedIn, Twitter, Snapchat, etc., allows lookalike audience targeting to reach your ideal customer.\nUse Relevant Hashtags\nHashtags are essential aspects that can make or break your social media presence, depending on how effectively you use them.\nThe most difficult task is to create a set of the most relevant and compelling hashtags for your brand.\nIf you don’t use hashtags relevant to your targeted audience, you’ll experience a lesser brand visibility and engagement rate.\nBest practice to use hashtags?\nYou have to include the hashtags in your post mentioned below:\n- Extremely popular hashtags\n- Moderately popular hashtags\n- Industry-specific hashtags\n- Branded hashtags\n- Location-based hashtags\nMany people follow hashtags using keyword based approaches to find their ideal audience.\nFor example, Britjaye, a wedding photographer, added several hashtags concerning the image and the target audience.\nIn the above image, you can see she uses content, branded, and niche-based hashtags to reach the ideal audience.\nPro Tip: Use different sets of hashtags in the early days to figure out which hashtags work for you.\nRun Contests and Giveaways\nRunning contests is the best way to engage with the audience on social media and give you immediate success.\nEvery brand has its own reasons to run contests, such as increasing followers, generating leads, building email lists, etc.\nSome of the social media contest types are:\n- Photo Contest: In a photo contest, selected users submit their photos based on the concept you specify, and the audience votes for the best one.\n- Comment to Win: In this contest, random people comment on one of your posts, and the best one wins accordingly.\n- Trivia Contest: Ask your audience some questions regarding your industry or product and whoever gives the correct answer, reward them.\n- Repost Giveaways: Ask your customers to repost their photo with your product or service. And, request them to use a specific hashtag so that you can track entries easily.\nFor example, Zappos, a shoe brand, held a social media contest with the hashtag #ImNotABox.\nIn this contest, they encouraged the followers and customers to share how to use empty cardboard shoe boxes.\nDoes the campaign go viral?\nDefinitely, Yes! Customers loved the campaign, and a high number of people took part in it. The prize money was a $500 gift card.\nAs the third step is to follow the brand on Instagram, so they gain followers as well.\nDeep Dive Into Social Media Analytics\nLast but not least, you should monitor your analytics at regular intervals to determine whether you’re achieving ROI as expected.\nIt’s also beneficial to understand if there’s a need to make changes in your campaigns.\nWith appropriate analytics, you can check various things such as:\n- What type of content your followers are most engaged in?\n- Which category is following you the most?\n- Are your followers real or fake?\n- Is there an increase in engagement rate after a certain period?\nSeveral social media analytics tools let you track your activity across all the platforms.\nFor example, Hubspot’s analytics tools let you monitor social media performance in the form of graphs, including the audience, interactions, clicks, and more.\nThe social media algorithm concerning the platform and the marketing strategy changes continuously, but the tactics discussed above will remain the same.\nThe secret to boosting your social media is to optimize your profile, provide a great user experience and high-quality content.\nOnce you set up your social media correctly, you’ll be capable of driving a huge number of leads for your business.\nDo you want to add any other social media strategy that works for you?

So, this fall wardrobe doesn’t need to eat into your wallet. Let's get started!\n1. Leather trench coat\nPick a very neutral, simple trench coat that will go with everything else in your fall capsule wardrobe. Choosing leather means your trench coat will give more dimension to your outfit.\nI chose a gray trench coat because it can easily be paired with denim, black or white.\n2. Chunky oversized sweater\nI chose gray again for this chunky sweater, for its pairing versatility. Here, I’m wearing it with plain black pants.\nThis loose-fitting, oversized sweater is soft and cozy – an essential for your fall wardrobe!\n3. Skin-tight long-sleeved top\nI chose a black top with an edgy-looking cut-out. The cut-out adds some spice to my wardrobe and the black color pairs with everything else.\n4. Basic white top\nAdd a simple white long-sleeved t-shirt to your fall capsule wardrobe as a perfect base piece for your other wardrobe essentials.\nI chose a long sleeve so that, in the fall weather, I can even wear it without a second layer.\n5. Classic black blazer\nThis is a foundational piece of outerwear for the fall. Choose one that is slightly oversized but still somewhat fitted.\nThis blazer will give you tons of styling options, including working as a coat in the fall.\n6. Two pant options\nInclude one dark and one light bottom in your fall wardrobe. I chose black leather pants, and light-washed, blue, denim jeans.\nThese two bottoms will provide options for pairing with all of your top pieces.\nThe black leather pants are for a less casual look than the jeans, but also pair well with everything else in your wardrobe.\n8. Basic black skirt\nThis black denim skirt, with a length somewhere between midi and maxi, is trendy and adds a different look into your fall capsule wardrobe.\n9. Two shoe options\nBecause one pair of shoes will never do, I’ve added two shoe options to this wardrobe: flats and heels.\nFor flats, I chose a pair of gray sneakers. They are comfortable and the gray matches all my other fall wardrobe pieces.\nA pair of simple black ankle boots with heels works when I need to style-up a bit more.\n9. Add color with accessories\nYour fall capsule wardrobe is all black, white and gray, so make your accessories colorful. Check out how my green bags pops against my black clothes!\nOf course, you can still turn to a simple black bag if you want to keep your look monochrome.\n10.

{"id": "1014", "text": "A man’s prostate never stops growing. And eventually, that growth keeps a lot of men up at night.\nBenign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), or an enlarged prostate, is the leading reason men visit a urologist. As many as half of all men by the age of 60 experience symptoms of BPH, which include trouble starting to urinate, a weak pee stream, and frequent urination at night.\nThat last symptom – the need to get up and pee at night, interrupting sleep – is a form of nocturia, or more specifically, nocturnal urinary frequency. It may sound like the title of a symphony, but nocturia is not restful. In fact, it is among the most common hints that a prostate is growing large enough to interfere with normal urinary functions.\nHere’s Why Your Prostate May Be Keeping You Awake\nThe prostate sits at the base of the bladder and behind the penis, and through its center runs the urethra, the tube that carries urine out of the body. The prostate is normally the size of a walnut, but it can begin to enlarge when a man approaches his 40s and 50s. Over a period of time, this growth could potentially block the urethra.\nThe good news is BPH is non-cancerous. However, its symptoms could become more than a nuisance. In fact, frequent and troubled urination patterns can affect one’s health in other ways:\nIt could weaken the bladder. If the urethra is closed off, the bladder will have to contract harder to push urine out. Over time, this weakens the bladder, potentially leading to other BPH urinary symptoms.\nIt can result in urinary tract infections (UTIs). When the bladder doesn’t fully empty, the residual urine could increase the risk of a urinary tract infection (UTI). Frequent UTIs can lead to kidney infections and sepsis.\nStored urine causes stones. When the bladder doesn’t completely empty, the minerals and salts in the urine are more likely to form into stones. Bladder and kidney stones also block urine flow – a double whammy to the BPH – and can cause infections, acute pain, and blood in the urine.\nThe kidneys may suffer. The kidneys are attached to the bladder through two ureters, the ducts through which urine passes. If urinary retention causes pressure on the bladder, it could eventually damage the kidneys. Also, if the bladder is infected, that infection could spread to the kidneys.\nDon’t Lose Sleep; BPH Care May Be Easier Than You Think\nIf caught early, nocturia-related symptoms of BPH can be treated non-invasively. Lifestyle modifications, such as changing diet and Kegel exercises, are a likely start. Medications, including muscle relaxants, also can treat mild to moderate BPH.\nFor more severe urinary symptoms related to advanced cases of BPH, several surgical options are available. These include small UroLift implants, an outpatient procedure, as well as prostate tissue removal. The latter procedure can be performed via robotic surgery, lasers, or through a narrow tube.\nTreatment is necessary not only to monitor the prostate’s growth, but also to ensure a good night’s sleep. This too will improve overall health and recovery, and ideally make nocturia a sleepy memory.\nExperiencing a difficult-to-maintain erection from time to time does not necessarily indicate clinically significant erectile dysfunction (ED). Occasional ED is, however, an opportunity to rule out underlying conditions that could be hindering your performance – and pursue one of the many treatments available. Why Erections Get in a Slump Erectile dysfunction is the inability to…\nSo you’ve committed to a healthier lifestyle in 2024.

{"id": "1023", "text": "Author: Radim Nakládal\nPublication date: 26/08\nWhat is MetaMask? You may ask. Well, as in the real world, when we want to operate with our financial assets, we need storage, a safe place. In the Crypto space, exactly for this purpose, we have the crypto currency wallets such as MetaMask and many others. Without crypto wallets, simply put, it’s hard to directly own and control crypto assets, besides other useful features.\nSo, the main focus of this article is to showcase basic characteristics of a crypto wallet. How does a crypto wallet work? What is a crypto wallet used for? Apart from the crypto wallet security, we will take a look at the MetaMask wallet itself and why it is unique.\n1. What is a crypto wallet?\nCrypto wallets operate with private keys to keep your stored cryptocurrency in them secure. They come in several varieties. Wallets can be either physical devices “cold” wallets, software programs “hot” wallets, online services ”non-custodial” wallets (crypto exchanges), or even paper-based. Accessible as desktop programs, browser plug-ins, and mobile apps.\n2. Why do we need them?\nThey serve as connectors to access the blockchain storing your crypto assets by using public and private keys. Basically, this means that you are a machine-readable proven owner of your coins.\n3. How does it work?\nThese keys have the ability to track ownership, receipt, or spending of cryptocurrencies. A public key allows others to make payments to the address derived from it (similar to the bank account number). A private key enables the spending of cryptocurrency from that address (similar to the PIN code)\n4. What is a seed phrase?\nAlso known as the recovery phrase - backup plan if you lose access to a crypto wallet or generated password. When creating a personal wallet, every crypto wallet platform generates a seed phrase. An important step is to write down the seed phrase and store it in a safe place, as anyone can access your wallet with the seed phrase.\n5. Are crypto wallets trustworthy?\nThe most important criteria for choosing a wallet is, of course, security. Consider the potential security risks involved. These risks can include threats such as hacking, phishing attacks, and loss of access to the wallet due to forgetting login credentials. As long as you have access to your recovery phase you can regain access to your funds in next to no time.\nUsually, cold storage wallets or hardware wallets are considered more secure. Their advantage is that they keep your private keys offline. When it comes to wallets from third parties, it's best to remember. “Not your keys, not your coins.”; “Be your own bank.”\nMoreover, fiat currency (i.e. traditional money) deposited in banks is usually protected by insurance. However, you won't get the same level of protection with cryptocurrencies. Therefore, we must be rather cautious.\nMetaMask is a free crypto wallet available on the web and mobile. Enables to storage and swap of cryptocurrencies, interacting with the Ethereum blockchain ecosystem, and hosting a growing array of decentralized applications (dApps). Giving access to the world of Web3. Raising the standards of usability in blockchain and crypto technology. Vitaly important for the growth of decentralized finance and non-fungible tokens. MetaMask is one of the world's most popular cryptographic applications. Thanks to its user experience (UX), frequent updates, and simple wallet interface.\nIn 2020, MetaMask was updated to allow integration with Binance Smart Chain(BSC). This means a free switch between Ethereum and Binance crypto wallets, trade on DEXes from both networks, and access dApps from both ecosystems. The decision to expand access to more blockchain networks supports MetaMask's primary goal of creating an interoperable and interconnected Web3 ecosystem.\nHow Does MetaMask Work?\nOne of the unique features of MetaMask as mentioned above is that it is used for Ethereum blockchain, Binance Smart Chain, and many layer 2 networks like Arbitrum, Polygon, etc., but not for the Bitcoin blockchain. Can be limiting, however, ERC-20 and ERC-721 token standards can be stored on the wallet. Passwords and private keys are securely stored by the application’s advanced encryption technology within the browser via a MetaMask extension. Such a design gives users more control over their public and private keys. Of course, each newly created account comes with a unique recovery seed phrase.\nMetaMask provides a trade function for peer-to-peer (P2P) token swaps. Basically, The transaction does not need to go through an order book, or decentralised exchange (DEX). Actually, this solution reduces friction, limits slippage, and lowers costs overall. Decentralized applications (dApps) such as crypto-loans, Ethereum-powered games, NFTs, and more are accessible directly from your wallet. The greatest utilization can be seen in spending, sending, or staking crypto. Within the Ethereum ecosystem without having to manage external wallet integrations or unnecessary transactions. Thus, MetaMask provides an entry point into the world of DeFi and other blockchain-based sectors and services. It provides a portal for end-users to access dApps while allowing developers to simplify the path to market for these applications.\n1. On-line security\nOn the one hand, MetaMask’s browser-based nature does not allow access to any of your personal information through the MetaMask extension itself. On the other hand, the web browser you access might. Although the browser will not have access to your private passwords or other sensitive data. Most browsers are engineered to collect information about when and how you use any built-in application or plugin. Theft of this data remains theoretically possible, since MetaMask stores private keys within the user’s browser. If you store passwords on your browser or device, do not save them. If your browser or device is hacked by malware, your stored passwords may be exposed. Your MetaMask assets are also at risk if your device is stolen.\n2. Save storage\nIt is for such reasons that cold storage is recommended. In case of large amounts of assets stored on hot wallets or due to long-term activity in the crypto space. Hot wallets can never be as secure as cold wallets.\nAdditionally, if you own a lot of cryptocurrencies, split these funds and diversify them in multiple wallets. This is always wise advice. By storing your cryptocurrencies in multiple places, you reduce the odds of losing all of your cryptocurrency funds if one wallet is hacked.\n3. Learn how to spot a scam\nThe easiest way to rob a cryptocurrency wallet is through phishing attacks. When clicking on an infected link, malware is downloaded to the computer and assets could be stolen. Another option is to open a fraudulent page that has a similar look to the official website. After filling in the login details, the attacker then disposes of the wallet credentials.\nJust to remind you. Here are some suggestions on how to defend yourself.\n● Am I expecting this message?\n● Is it about a legitimate request?\n● Do I need to click the link?\n● Are there spelling mistakes?\n● Avoid pop-ups\nSince its release in 2016, MetaMask has established itself to be one of the most used and trusted crypto wallets. In fact, it has undoubtedly played a major role in the development of decentralized applications and giving access to the world of Web3. Although MetaMask interacts with the Ethereum blockchain ecosystem for now, we may see further expansion in the future. As for security. Nothing is perfect. Especially in today's digital world. On the one hand, it brings us amazing technology and possibilities. On the other hand, it can seem confusing and hard to navigate. Fraudsters are on the rise and are constantly improving their practices. The only thing that can help us is to educate ourselves and adapt.\nYou can also read about:\n● “What Is a Crypto Wallet\"", "scores": {"score": 3, "score_transform_1": 5, "score_transform_2": 5, "score_transform_3": 0}}

{"id": "1042", "text": "How to Remove Salt from Saltwater: The Best Ways to Purify and Reuse Your Saltwater\nSalt is a mineral that exists in a lot of water sources, including seawater. It is an excellent source of minerals and trace elements, but it can also harbor salt.\nUnfortunately, it's also one of the most corrosive substances on earth. These salts will impact marine life and cause water quality problems. It is important to remove these salts before using the water for other purposes. Luckily, there are a few ways to get rid of salt from saltwater.\nSalinity in freshwater can be regulated using seawater desalination. This is why it is used to provide potable water for developing countries. However, this process consumes a large amount of energy and threatens marine life and fisheries. Here's how to remove salt from seawater.\nHow to Remove Salt from Saltwater\nThere are various methods that you can use to remove salt from your water. One of the most common methods is to boil the water. Another technique is to filter the water with a combination of sand and gravel. If you do not want to add salt, it is best to use distilled or reverse osmosis (RO) water. The last option is to use a deionizer machine.\nGuide: How to Use Deionizer Machine\nThe first method is boiling the water. Boiling is a simple way to remove salt from water. All you need is a pan and some hot water. You should have enough room for the water to expand as it boils. To start, fill up the pan about half full. Then put the pan over medium heat. After about 10 minutes, the water will begin to bubble. Or you can also boil water using microwave.\nOnce it does, turn off the heat and let the water cool down. When the water cooled down, pour the water and place the pan back on the stove. Fill up the pan again with fresh water. Repeat this process until all the salt has been removed.\nSand and Gravel Filter\nAnother method is filtering the water through a combination of sand and rock. Before you begin:\n- Make sure that your sand and gravel are clean.\n- Wash them thoroughly with soap and warm water.\n- Make sure that they are dry before adding them to your container.\n- Mix equal parts of each material.\n- Add the mixture to a bucket or barrel.\n- Pour the water into the container.\n- Let the water sit overnight.\n- In the morning, take the sand and gravel out of the container.\n- Put them in a separate container.\n- Rinse the container and repeat the process.\n- Continue doing this until all the salt has evaporated.\nDistilled/Reverse Osmosis Water\nIf you don't want to add any salt to your water, you can use distilled or RO water. Distilled water comes directly from a spring or well. Reverse osmosis water is produced by passing water through a membrane that filters out contaminants. The result is pure water.\nTo produce RO water, you will need to buy a RO system. There are two types of systems: those that need electricity and those that run on solar power. If you choose to go with the latter, you will need to buy batteries. The advantage of this type of system is that it produces very little waste.\nA deionizer works by removing ions from the water. Ions are electrically charged particles that exist in all matter. They are essential because they help maintain electrical neutrality. Deionizing machines work by passing the water through a column filled with negatively charged resin beads.\nAs the water passes through the columns, the ions attach themselves to the resin. The resin is then placed in another container where the water is collected. The resin beads are cleaned and reused.\nIt is possible to build your deionizer. However, if you decide to do so, you will need to spend a considerable amount of money. A better alternative is to buy a pre-built unit.\nOsmosis - Removing Salt From Water\nThe osmotic pressure is a force that pushes molecules together or apart. Here, we are trying to push ions away from each other. The process of removing salt from water uses this principle.\nOsmosis is a natural phenomenon where water moves through a semipermeable membrane. When you apply a difference in concentration between two sides of the membrane, water flows through.\nTo use osmosis to remove salt from water, we need to put our saltwater into a container with a semipermeable membrane. Then, we add fresh water to the opposite side of the membrane.\nFreshwater has less salt than saltwater, so that it will flow through the membrane. As the water passes through the membrane, it removes some salt from the saltwater. Eventually, all the saltwater becomes pure water.\nThis method works best when the concentration of salt in the saltwater is high. If you have low concentrations of salt, then the saltwater may not move as much. Also, if you don't have enough fresh water available, the amount of salt removed may not be sufficient.\nMembrane Distillation - Removing Salt From Seawater\nWater passes through a porous membrane while solids and bacteria aren't allowed to pass through it. The pores in the membrane allow the water to pass through, but they prevent the salt from passing through.\nThe salt stays behind in the tank. Freshwater is added to the top of the tank, which causes the salt to dissolve in the freshwater. The salty water rises to the top of the membrane. The clean water comes down below the membrane.\nThere are several advantages to using a membrane distillation system:\n- It doesn't need any electricity.\n- It's easy to maintain because it does not require cleaning.\n- It produces very little waste.\n- It is effective at removing salt from large volumes of water.\n- It is a cost-effective option for small-scale applications.\nElectrolysis - Removing Salt From Sea Water\nAn electrolytic cell is like a battery. It contains electrodes and an electrolyte solution. An electric current runs through the electrolyte solution, causing chemical reactions to take place.\nIn this case, the electrolyte solution would contain saltwater and freshwater. A negative electrode would be placed in the saltwater, and a positive electrode would be placed in freshwater. The current would run through the salt water, causing the salt to separate in sodium chloride.\nThe advantage of using an electrolytic cell is that it requires no energy input. However, it is only useful for small quantities of salt. For larger amounts, you'll need to use another method.\nThe Science Behind How to Remove Salt From Water\nAqueous solutions interact with dissolving and precipitating substances to dissolve the salt.\nHere, we will explore how you can remove salt from water using various methods.\nSalt is a major source of contaminants in treated drinking water. If left unchecked, it would eventually find its way into the distribution system and increase dissolved solids levels. Dissolved solids include things like calcium, magnesium, sulfate, and chlorides. They can lead to corrosion in pipes and damage to plumbing fixtures.\nIf you want to keep your drinking water safe, you should reduce the amount of salt in it. You can do this by filtering or treating the water. But if you want to get rid of the salt completely, you can use reverse osmosis. RO uses pressure to force water through a semipermeable membrane. This membrane prevents all ions except those with a low molecular weight from passing through.\nSalt in Your Food Every Day Is a Risk to Your Health\nSalt consumption can cause health problems, including high blood pressure, heart disease, and kidney failure. A new study suggests that the salt content in packaged food is up to twice as high as what's on the label.\nThe study found that many canned soups, spaghetti sauces, and biscuits have twice as much sodium as they claim. Every day, Americans consume more than double the recommended sodium intake.\nIn addition, even if consumers only consume the recommended amount of sodium per day, they consume half their daily allowance in just one meal.\nMany people think it's okay to eat too much salt because it's in many foods like bread and vegetables. But this is untrue because it causes serious health issues.\nYou might not realize it, but your body needs salt to function properly. Without enough salt, your muscles won't contract properly, and your brain won't work correctly. In addition, your kidneys have trouble removing excess salt from your bloodstream.\nSo, if you're trying to lose weight, avoid processed foods that have added salt. Instead, eat fresh fruits and veggies that don't add any extra salt.\nWhat is the Problem with Salt in Sea Water?\nThe problem with salt in seawater is not only the amount of sodium but also the salt concentration. On average, the salt concentration has risen to 80%.\nSalt levels are too high in seawater. This means that there is more salt than water. It also means that there is more pollution and less oxygen for humans to breathe as well! When this happens, marine life can die because there is not enough oxygen in the water to breathe.\nToo much salt has caused too much pollution, and it has impacted human health as well. The World Health Organization recommends an intake limit of 2,300 milligrams per day. That's about 10% of your daily recommended value!\nHow to filter salt substances from my bathing water\nThere are two methods for filtering salt from your bathing water. One uses a sand filter, and the other uses a carbon filter. Both of them work well, but they have their limitations.\nThis type of filter works best when the concentration of salt in the water is low. It consists of a container filled with sand. The sand absorbs the salt as the water passes through it. After some time, the sand becomes saturated with salt. Then, the water must be changed if the salt concentration is higher than normal, then the sand will become clogged. That makes the filter ineffective.\nThese filters are more efficient than sand filters. Carbon filters consist of granules made from activated charcoal. During the water flow through the filter, the salt sticks to the charcoal particles. When the water leaves the filter, the salt remains behind.\nHow can one remove salt from well water?\nWell water often contains high levels of salt. To remove this salt, you'll need to use reverse osmosis. RO uses pressure to push water through membranes. The membrane filters out molecules too big to pass through. This leaves behind pure water.\nA semipermeable membrane is forced through water during reverse osmosis. The membrane keeps the bigger molecules inside while letting the smaller ones pass through.\nThis process removes salt from the water. However, it doesn't remove everything. For example, some minerals remain. And, the process can leave behind a small amount of waste called concentrate.\nHow can we separate salt from water using evaporative cooling?\nEvaporative cooling is a method used to remove salt from water. It involves heating water until it boils. At this point, steam begins to condense. As the steam condenses, it turns back into liquid water. This causes the temperature of the water to drop.\nAs the temperature drops, the vapor becomes less dense. That makes it easier to move upward. As a result, the water rises to the surface. You can then collect the water in a bucket.\nIf you want to use evaporative cooling to remove salt, you'll need a container that has a lid. It needs to have holes to let air flow through the container. You also need to place the container outside.\nOnce the water starts to condense, you'll know when your evaporation is complete. When you've collected enough water, you can start filtering it.\nUsing evaporative cooling to remove salts requires a lot of energy. Because of this, you won't find many people doing this at home. Instead, they're more likely to rely on reverse osmosis.\nHow can one remove salt from water for plant cultivation?\nYou have two options for removing salt from salt water. One method involves letting the water sit in a closed container for several days. Another option is to pass the water through activated carbon filters. Both methods work well. However, they require patience.\nActivated carbon filters have been around for decades. They were originally designed for removing impurities from gasoline. Activated charcoal acts like a sponge. It absorbs contaminants while allowing clean air to flow through.\nHowever, this doesn't mean it works perfectly. There are some drawbacks to using activated carbon filters. For example, it requires regular maintenance. You'll need to replace the material every few months.\nAnother drawback is that the filters tend to clog up over time. To combat this problem, you can add a small amount of bleach to the water. Bleach helps keep the carbon fresh.\nIf you're looking for a more permanent solution, you can install a reverse osmosis system. Reverse osmosis systems work like dialysis machines. They use pressure to separate dissolved solids from water.\nReverse osmosis systems are usually installed in homes. They cost thousands of dollars, though. And, they don't always produce high-quality water. That said, they do come with their own set of benefits. For example, they are relatively easy to maintain. They also produce water that is safe to drink.\nHow to Remove Salt From a Dish at Home without a Recipe\nSalt can be removed easily in a dish without using a recipe. The dish will still taste great because of the flavors that are already present in the dish.\nThe process is quite simple, but it does take time. When making a soup, it is best to get rid of all the salt before adding any other ingredients.\nSalt will always make food taste better, but you might want to make it less salty for health reasons or for people who don't like salt on their food.\nHow to Remove Salt from Saltwater for Cooking\nIn this recipe, you'll learn how to remove the salt from saltwater so that you can use it for cooking purposes.\nSaltwater is often used as a cooking medium for dishes such as fish, seafood, and vegetables. However, if these ingredients are not cooked in water with no salt, they can be too salty.\nTo make the process of removing the salt simpler and easier for you, here are some tips on how to do it:\n- Turn off your stove before adding any salt to the water;\n- After boiling off all the water's liquid part (preferably using a pot with a lid), let the pot cool down;\n- Once cooled down, pour out all the liquid part (there will now only matter left);\n- Let the mixture stand overnight;\n- In the morning, strain the mixture using a strainer;\n- Rinse the strainer with hot water;\n- Repeat the above steps until all the salt has been removed.\nTips & Tricks:\n- Be sure to turn off your stove before adding salt to the water. Otherwise, you may end up burning yourself.\n- Boiling off all the liquid parts of the water is essential. Without doing so, you won't be able to remove the salt.\n- Make sure to let the pot cool down after boiling off all of the liquid. Otherwise, you risk getting burned by the heat.\n- Pour out all the liquid parts into another container. Don't just throw them away. Use them later for something else.\n- Let the mixture sit overnight. Doing so will help the salt dissolve faster.\n- Strain the mixture using a straining device. You can use a cheesecloth or even a clean cloth.\n- Rinse the strainer well with hot water.\n- Repeat the above steps until you've successfully removed all the salt from the mixture.\n- Store the remaining saltwater in a bottle or jar.\n10 Tips on How To Remove Salt From Water & Preserve Your Home Brews\nIn conclusion, we have provided 10 tips on removing the salt from the water and preserving your home brews. We hope that these tips can help you in your next brewing project.\nFirst of all, you need to evaluate the recipe for what it will be used for – beer or a drink – before deciding on a type of water. The different types of water will change the process.\nSecond, the best way to remove salt from water is by using a cold water bath with a natural mineral balance. You can also try boiling with ice or using distilled water or reverse osmosis filters before adding them back in.\nThird, if you want to remove the salt from water without adding anything else to it, you should use a reverse osmosis filtration system.\nFourth, if you are looking for a cheap and easy way to remove salt from the water, you can use a salt block.\nFifth, if you are concerned about the taste of the water after removing the salt, you can use a carbonated water bottle.\nSixth, if you want to make sure that you only use clean water, you should use bottled water.\nSeventh, if you want to save money, then you should consider buying a reverse osmosis machine.\nEight, if you want the highest quality water possible, you'll need a reverse osmosis system that can produce up to 200 gallons of water per day.\nNinth, to avoid making mistakes in the brewing process, always make sure that the water temperature is right before you start.\nLastly, if you want to keep your home brews safe from contamination, you should store them properly.\nTurning Seawater into Fresh Water for Coastal Survival\nLocate your life raft and some other debris. It’s possible to use elements of your daily life raft to build a method for making fresh water from seawater.\n- This system is the most useful if you’re stranded on a beach without new water.\n- It was developed from the flying pilot through WWII in the Pacific.\n- This is a beneficial method, mainly if you don’t know how much time it’s going to be till it’s possible to be rescued.\n- Locate the gas jar out of your daily life raft. Open it and fill it with sea water.\n- A filter that the seawater using fabric so that you don’t get a lot of sand or debris from the water.\n- Do not fill up the bottle too much. You are going to want to prevent spilling the water from the surface of the container.\n- Carries back the water to an area where you can earn a fire.\nLocate the hose and flow stoppers in the life raft. Attach the hose to one end of this flow stoppers\n- This will offer a tube to get new condensed water vapor to venture from this jar of seawater as it’s heated.\n- Make sure that the hose has no kinks or clogs.\n- Notice the seal between the nozzle and flow stoppers is powerful. This can help you avoid any new water leaking from the hose.\nPlug up the top of the gas bottle with the leak stoppers. Use the opposite end of the leak stoppers from where you’ve attached the hose.\n- This will offer a means for water vapor to maneuver by the jar as it’s headed to the tube to transfer fresh water.\n- Make sure that the seal is tight enough to prevent escapes.\n- If you’ve any twine or tape, then you can fortify the seal together with these products.\n- Construct a bank of sand and then bury the hose. This is going to keep the tube steady since clean water travels.\n- Maintain the end of the tube vulnerable. This is where new water will trickle out.\n- Do not irritate the gas jar or flow stoppers. You’ll have to get this vulnerable to maintain the watch to be sure that there are not any leaks.\n- Make sure that the hose is comparatively directly and free of kinks because you irritate it.\nPut a pan beneath the exposed end of this hose. This may accumulate water from the new pool.\nWhat makes water saline?\nWhat do you know about saline water? The answer is that the saline water contains a lot of dissolved salts. In such case, the attention is the amount of salt in water since stated in parts per million. As water has absorption of 10,000 ppm of mixed salts, 1% of the heaviness of water comes from dissolved salts.\nUnder we have parameters for the saline water\n- Slightly saline water – From 1,000 ppm to 3,000 ppm\n- Moderately saline water – From 3,000 ppm to 10,000 ppm\n- Fresh water – Less than 1,000 ppm\n- Highly saline water – From 10,000 ppm to 35,000 ppm\n- By the way, ocean water contains about 35,000 ppm of salt.\nStatistics for Salt Water\n- One percent of the weight of water contains 10,000 parts per million dissolved salts.\n- About 30% of the world's irrigated land is affected by salinity, and remediation costs are high.\n- Eighteen thousand four hundred twenty-six desalination plants supply 300 million people with water daily across five continents.\n- Compared to 2013, the number of cubic meters produced increased by 10.71%.\n- Remember that the oceans make up about 97% of all the water on, inside, and above the Earth.\n- Saline water accounts for more than 13 percent of all water used in the U.S.\n- Approximately 5 percent of all industrial water used is saline water, and 53 percent of all mining water is saline water.\n- Reverse osmosis is currently the most widely used \"gold standard\" process for removing salt.\n- It claims that the bottle eliminates 99.9% of pathogens in water, but this bottle doesn't seem to comply with the company's claims.\n- Up to 90% of the sodium present in water can be removed by adding potassium chloride.\nHow Seawater Desalination Works\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs) about Removing Salt from Saltwater\n1. Can you boil salt water to make it drinkable?\nYes, if the water is not too salty. You can also add a little bit of sugar or honey to sweeten it up.\n2. How do we turn salty water into fresh drinking water?\nThe technology is not yet advanced enough to make desalination plants cost-effective in most applications. Water can only be made from seawater by reverse osmosis, which is energy-intensive. And that means it's not practical for many regions with high electricity costs.\nYou should read: How to make saltwater drinkable?\n3. Can you remove dissolved salt from the water?\nNo. Dissolved salt cannot be removed from the water. All you can do is reduce the amount of salt in the water. That's what desalination plants do. They remove the salt from the water and replace it with fresh water.\n4. What happens if I don’t remove salt from my swimming pool?\nYour pool will eventually fill with salt. If you leave it untreated, algae will grow in the pool. Finally, the algae will die off, leaving the pool covered with dead algae. Once that happens, the chlorine in the pool will break down the dead algae, releasing toxic chemicals into the air. Those chemicals may be harmful to people who breathe them in.\n5. Is it safe to swim in saltwater?\nSwimming in saltwater isn't dangerous. But it does carry health risks. Some bacteria thrive in saltwater, such as Vibrio cholera. People who come in contact with contaminated water can develop diarrhea. Also, the skin of swimmers can dry out quickly because salt evaporates very easily. So, it's better to avoid getting wet feet.\n6. Is there a cheaper way to remove salt from seawater other than desalination?\nYes. There are several options available. For example, you could use a reverse osmosis system to purify the water. Or, you could install a solar still. A solar still collects sunlight and converts it to steam. The steam turns turbines that generate power. In this case, the heat generated by the sun would evaporate the salt from the sea.\n7. Can saltwater be filtered through cloth to drink?\nNo. Water passing through a piece of fabric will pick up any impurities present in the water. However, the water will remain cloudy. To clarify the water, you need to pass it through another layer of cloth.\n8. Why is salt so bad for us?\nSalt is essential to our bodies. Our cells require sodium chloride to function properly. Without salt, our muscles wouldn't contract, our hearts wouldn't beat, and our brains wouldn't process information. Salt helps regulate body temperature. It also helps keep fluids inside and outside your body balanced.\nBut too much salt can be as bad for us as too little. Too much salt causes fluid retention and swelling in the legs and ankles. It also makes the blood thicker, increasing the risk of heart attack and stroke. High levels of salt in the bloodstream can lead to kidney damage, liver failure, and even death.\n9. So how do we know when we have too much salt?\nMost doctors recommend keeping your daily intake below 2 grams per day. Anything above that level should be considered a medical emergency. Keep in mind that some foods naturally contain more salt than others. For instance, salted butter contains about 3 times as much salt as unsalted butter.\nAlso, check the label on food packaging. Salt is common in processed foods. And, remember that many restaurants add extra salt to their dishes.\nThose concerned about their salt intake should try cutting back on salty snacks like potato chips and pretzels. You might find that you enjoy healthier alternatives like fruits or vegetables instead.\n10. Why can’t we filter saltwater?\nSaltwater has a high concentration of dissolved solids, which means it's full of solid particles. When you put something in a container, it tends to sink to the bottom. That's because the particles don't want to stay together. They prefer to separate themselves from each other. That's why saltwater sinks.\nWhen you filter saltwater, you force the particles to stick together. As a result, they form a thick sludge at the bottom of the tank. If you try to pour the sludge off, it'll only make things worse. Instead, you need to let the tank settle for 24 hours. Then, you can skim off the top of the liquid.\n11. Can I drink seawater after I boil it?\nNo! Boiling water destroys all its nutrients. So, if you plan to consume the water, you must first treat it with chemicals. Chemicals such as chlorine and iodine help prevent bacteria and viruses from growing in the water.\nYou should also avoid drinking saltwater directly. Doing so can increase the risk of dehydration. Also, you may experience diarrhea and stomach cramps.\n12. How to get rid of salt from drinking water\nThe best way to get rid of salt is by boiling the water. The heat breaks down the salt into harmless compounds. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency recommends boiling water for 10 minutes to kill harmful germs.\nTo boil water, fill a large pot with cold tap water. Once the water reaches a rolling boil, reduce the heat to medium-low. Allow the water to simmer for 10 minutes. Afterward, turn off the heat and allow the water to cool completely.\n13. What is the time it takes to get rid of salt?\nIt depends on where you live. Some areas are located near oceans, lakes, rivers, or underground aquifers. Others are far away from any natural bodies of water.\nIn either case, it takes time to get rid of salt. Depending on the amount of salt in the water, it could take several days to several weeks. But, it's not impossible.\n14. Is there an easier way to purify saltwater?\nYes. There are many different methods available. One method involves filtering out the salt through a cloth. Another option uses activated charcoal. Yet another method consists in adding baking soda to the water. All three of these options work well. However, none of them are quick.\n15. What happens when I use a saltwater filter?\nFilters remove impurities from the water. But, they do nothing to remove the salt. To solve this problem, you need to buy a reverse osmosis system. A reverse osmosis unit removes both salt and contaminants from the water.\n16. Do you need an advanced degree to remove salt from water?\nNot necessarily.

{"id": "1046", "text": "The Rise of SMS Marketing: Why It’s an Essential Channel for Your Brand\nThe Rise of SMS Marketing: Why It's an Essential Channel for Your Brand\nIn the ever-evolving landscape of digital marketing, brands are constantly seeking new ways to engage with their customers and drive conversions. One channel that has experienced a significant rise in popularity in recent years is SMS marketing. With the widespread use of mobile devices and the increasing preference for texting, SMS marketing has emerged as a powerful tool for brands to reach their target audience directly. In this blog post, we will explore the reasons behind the rise of SMS marketing and why it is now an essential channel for your brand.\n- High Open Rates and Engagement\nOne of the primary reasons why SMS marketing has gained immense popularity is its impressive open and response rates. Unlike emails that often get buried in cluttered inboxes or social media posts that can easily go unnoticed, SMS messages are typically opened and read within minutes of delivery. Email marketing has long been a popular channel for brands, but it faces challenges such as low open rates and increasing competition in users’ crowded inboxes. SMS marketing, on the other hand, boasts impressive open rates. Studies have shown that SMS messages have an open rate of over 98%, with most messages being read within a few minutes of delivery. This high level of engagement provides brands with an opportunity to capture the attention of their customers effectively and deliver their message in a timely manner.\n- Instantaneous Communication\nIn today’s fast-paced world, consumers expect instant gratification and immediate responses. SMS marketing caters to this need by enabling brands to communicate with their customers in real time. Whether it’s sending out flash sales, time-sensitive promotions, or urgent updates, SMS allows brands to deliver information instantly and ensure that their customers receive it promptly. This instantaneous communication fosters a sense of urgency and encourages customers to take immediate action, resulting in higher conversion rates for brands. SMS marketing enables brands to establish direct and personalized communication with their customers. By collecting customer phone numbers through opt-in methods, businesses can create a direct line of communication. This personal touch fosters a sense of exclusivity and makes customers feel valued. Additionally, SMS allows for highly targeted messaging. Brands can segment their audience based on various criteria such as demographics, purchase history, or geographic location and send tailored messages that resonate with specific customer groups. Personalization enhances customer experience and increases the likelihood of conversion.\n- Personalization and Targeting\nSMS marketing provides brands with the opportunity to personalize their messages and target specific segments of their audience effectively. By leveraging customer data and segmentation techniques, brands can tailor their SMS campaigns to suit the preferences and needs of individual customers, leading to increased engagement and loyalty. Moreover, SMS marketing allows for advanced targeting based on factors such as demographics, location, and purchase history, enabling brands to deliver highly relevant content to their customers.\n- Opt-in and Opt-out Compliance\nOne concern with any marketing channel is ensuring compliance with privacy regulations and obtaining the necessary content from customers. SMS marketing operates on an opt-in basis, meaning that customers must explicitly provide their consent to receive text messages from a brand. This opt-in requirement ensures that brands are communicating with an audience that is genuinely interested in their offerings, resulting in higher engagement and fewer complaints. Additionally, SMS marketing platforms typically provide easy opt-out mechanisms, allowing customers to unsubscribe from messages at any time. This transparency and control over communication contribute to building trust between brands and their customers.\nCompared to traditional marketing channels like print advertising or television commercials, SMS marketing offers a highly cost-effective solution for brands. The costs associated with SMS marketing are significantly lower, especially when considering the potential return on investment. With the ability to reach a large audience at a fraction of the cost of other channels, SMS marketing allows brands, both big and small, to implement effective marketing campaigns without straining their budgets.", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}
{"id": "1047", "text": "It’s common knowledge that keywords are essential to any website copy. They constitute the terms that users type in the search bar to find answers to their questions or find products and services tailored to their needs. So, when writing, we need to ensure that these keywords and their variations are incorporated into the relevant pages of our site. Failing to do so will result in missing out on the precious targeted and quality traffic you’re after.\nKeyword stuffing was once, a relatively successful SEO strategy, but we highly recommend leaving this tactic in the early 2000s where it belongs. . However, today it’s a terrible thing to do! Including a keyword into your copy too often can cause the piece of content to be removed from SERPs altogether.\nThere’s no outsmarting Google, whose Crawlers can recognize the practice and are penalising it. Remember that successful SEO takes into account both parties: real readers and AI, and as technology evolves, algorithms focus on providing the best experience for users.\nSo, flooding a copy with the same words is spammy, unnatural and boring. But, how to know if your content falls into that category? Well, best practice suggests sticking to the ‘less than 2%’ rule when it comes to keyword density. In other words, the number of times the term appears in the content divided by the total number of words should aim to not exceed 2%. No formula is a match for simple human instinct though, because context, relevance and great writing are way more important than keywords.\nTo get the most out of keywords the phrases you’re targeting, you need original content that satisfies a searcher query. Getting help from a professional SEO copywriter will ensure you get the balance just right and produce highly optimised content that drives organic traffic, entertains and informs the reader.\nGoogle gives guidance on creating quality content around specific terms and mentions that websites should “focus on creating useful, information-rich content that uses keywords appropriately and in context”.\nThe first step is to identify your keywords. There are plenty of tools that allow you to discover search volumes behind search terms with reasonable accuracy. Google’s Keyword Planner tool is a great, freeway to determine your target keywords. You can still access it without a Google ads account, although the data will be a little less precise. Paid tools like SEMrush offer a very comprehensive platform to tap into. You can find many free tools for this purpose like Wordtracker, Google Trends, Keyword Tool Dominator or AnswerThe Public, although some of them may have a daily search limit.\nA good starting point is thinking about terms related to your industry, your business and products/services, but remember that usually the higher the search volume, the tougher the competition! One way to overcome this is to target search terms with less volume as they tend to generate results faster with the right approach. Targeting various keywords with smaller volume can sometimes be a more fruitful strategy. What matters the most here is that doing your research will help drive results.\nYou can tap into many keyword types, keeping in mind that the more specific, the better. This is especially the case for pages deeper within the site architecture, like product pages.\n1. Short-tail/Core/Primary/Head Terms. These are the main keyword that you wish to target. They are generally shorter. For example, boots, holidays, laptop, indoor plants.\n2. Long-tail keywords . They complement the primary keyword and describe it, for example, cheap laptop or Air France flights or holidays in France, red yoga pants.\n3. Modifiers. These refer to terms that are essentially the same but are slightly tweaked. (cheap, cheapest, cheaper)\n4. Synonyms. Generally, users tend to vary their search query. So, to stay relevant, we must include variations.\n5. Singular/Plural. Search queries will include both plural and singular terms (indoor plant vs indoor plants).\nGoogle and other search engines can understand text pretty well. It knows that eat, eating and eats are essentially the same thing by using ‘keyword stemming’ and this allows us to diversify our choice of words.\nIt is important to note that you should stay away from focusing on the same keywords or keywords groups to avoid what is known as ‘keyword cannibalisation’. This happens when pages on the same site start competing against each other, leaving crawlers uncertain about which page should rank. If a website had many pages that strongly focused on ‘content marketing services’, the said site might lose some visibility as keyword cannibalisation would occur. Hence, why it’s key to have a structure in which you specify which pages target what keywords.\nNow that you know which keywords to use for each particular page, it’s time to add them into your copy. It’s considered best practice to use short-tail keywords for the home page and top-level pages, in other words, the head terms, plus modifiers and qualifiers.\nAs you delve deeper into your site, getting to your products/services pages, you’ll want to add those long-tail keywords which reflect a user-specific search intent, for example, ‘black long dress’ if you have a clothing business.\nWhen writing, aim to include as many variations of the head term as long as it makes sense, using synonyms and singular/plural forms of a word. Adding variety will help your content from falling into the keyword stuffing category which, as mentioned earlier, is detrimental to visibility, ranking and revenue. The key takeaway is that your text sounds natural, and following these steps is a good starting point to crafting great, and targeted content.\nMaking use of keywords is the basis of SEO copywriting, nonetheless, you need to engage in the process of writing with traffic and conversion in mind. Stay away from the outdated and penalised keyword stuffing practice. Have a structure of what page targets which keyword(s) to avoid cannibalisation and traffic loss.\nOne main benefit of using relevant terms is that it allows you to target specific users’ intent, increasing your CTR as a result for that keyword. A higher click-through rate, in turn, will improve authority for those terms helping you rank higher. Virtuous circle!\nBecause content is king and is THE response to search queries, make sure to put those best practice tips into play to drive conversions.

{"id": "1049", "text": "For many of us, our pets are just like children. In recent decades, the question of “pet custody” has become a very real issue in divorce courts around the nation, especially when the break-up isn’t amicable. Court battles over pets can get just as nasty as child custody battles — or sometimes nastier. And it’s not an issue that’s likely to go away any time soon, particularly since courts (and legislatures) are starting to address the issue.\nAs the law currently stands in New Jersey, the courts consider pets as “property” to be divided during a divorce just like any other marital asset. It is rare for judges to work out any time-sharing arrangement; typically in a judge-decided settlement, one party keeps the family pet. However, when couples opt for private divorce mediation, there is more room to work out some kind of custody arrangement, given that both of you are open to “shared custody” of the family pet.\nWilling to negotiate for time with your pet? Here are some factors to consider before making your case:\n— Are you prepared to share the animal with your spouse — and can you do so amicably? If you are undergoing divorce mediation, it’s possible an arrangement can be created so both of you can continue to share your pet, even while you live apart. But understand that the effort involved in joint pet custody is no different from the effort required to share children — although as a rule, dogs and cats have much shorter lifespans than children, so at least there’s a time limit involved. Those of you with large parrots, such as macaws or African Grays (average lifespan of 50 years or more) should keep in mind that you’re the exception to this rule when deciding on joint custody.\n— If joint custody isn’t a possibility (because of a less-than-amicable split, for example), do you trust your spouse to take good care of the animal despite his or her loathing for you? If you believe the animal might suffer abuse or neglect as a result of your spouse’s anger, then it’s worth trying to obtain sole custody; if not, you may do better to relinquish the dog or cat to your spouse. Chances are, that will make the divorce process go more smoothly. However…\n— If you absolutely, positively can’t bear the thought of being without your pet for any length of time, then you’ll need to make the case that the animal belongs with you. Documenting the nature of your time with your pet is probably the best way to do this — that is, detailing how often you and your dog play in the park together, or the way your cat sits on your feet while you’re working, can be helpful. And don’t think the animal’s wishes don’t enter into it, even if your divorce ends up litigated before a judge. If you can show video clips or get eyewitness testimony to show that the animal is more attached to you than to your spouse, the judge may consider that evidence in his or her decision.\nCBS News Report – Divorce lawyers: Pet custody cases increasing:", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

The tradition continues.\nAlmost Anything Wood can do absolutely everything with wood that you need. Their custom cabinetry expertise makes kitchen renovations the talk of the town, for good reason. And while it remains their most popular customer request, their success with repeat business has customers (and the children of former customers) welcoming them back to complete other projects in and around homes and businesses too. Whether your project is a complete kitchen renovation, a bathroom redesign or customized wall unit, shelving or customized storage for the entranceway to your home, Almost Anything Wood will make your dream a reality.\nIt all begins with a vision and a simple conversation. Dave and Nick will come to you to get a sense of your space, determine your needs and suggest the best way to make use of your living space. Measurements in hand, they’ll head to the drawing board, a virtual computerized system that will allow them to produce a virtual three-dimensional design of your room or project. With your vision a virtual reality, there is time to make changes, select wood finishes, colours, whatever you like.\nFind your inspiration in the Almost Anything Wood showroom, complete with two model kitchens and a full selection of cabinet styles, finishes, doors, handles and other accents. With trusted suppliers and three decades of expertise, you can be sure the product quality of every material here meets Dave’s high standards. Fully customizable, your designs will function to your specifications, from soft close track fixtures and hinges to dovetailed drawers and stylish décor features.\nFrom the current trends of wood islands, with seamless design, to modern flat panel cupboards for a sleek finish, to the popularity of painted white cabinets, blending an old look with a new style, Almost Anything Wood has the skill and craftsmanship to build it right. Perhaps you’d prefer the traditional look of walnut cabinets, the honey warmth of maple or the elegance of cherry, or even a more exotic appeal of woods such as teak. The choice is yours and there are so many options. Whatever you decide, Dave and Nick will be sure your space reflects your lifestyle as you see fit.\nWhen they say “customized,” the team at Almost Anything Wood mean it. Every cabinet, vanity, or unit is cut and finished to meet your unique design specifications, whatever they may be. There are no pre-fab pieces or particle board materials.

It also provides a reliable network of qualified trades contacts for their customers. Being able to recommend trusted local trades is important to Almost Anything Wood, and it’s that experience and knowledge that their customers rely on.\nWhile custom-cabinetry and kitchens are the mainstay of their business, Nick has introduced the inspired wood-working trend of live edge furniture and décor to the Almost Anything Wood showroom, and it has been a great success.\nSo, what is ‘Live Edge’? Well, basically, it is taking a vertical slice from the trunk of a tree, and turning it into something both useful and spectacularly unique. The bark can be left on the edge of the wood, giving each piece a raw, weathered feel. Being a vertical slice of wood, the pattern of grain is complete. Natural flaws and inconsistencies are left, and even enhanced, to become part of the overall finish. It’s artful, appealing, and functional. No two pieces are alike.\nThe character of these live edge pieces is not only in the grain of the wood, but in the story behind them. Cut from local trees, downed by storms or by nature of their age, Nick knows the history of the trees that then inspire his creative recycling ideas. Sometimes an old tree is turned into a sentimental keepsake piece, like a beautiful dining table for the family. Live edge wood serves many purposes from furniture to smaller items, such as serving platters, Charcuterie boards and more.\nAlmost Anything Wood is now a certified dealer of Ecopoxy, a colourful way to embellish live edge pieces with flair. Add resin colours to fill in the natural voids and grooves of the wood and transform them to create something spectacular. With coloured kits, anyone can embellish their live edge pieces with ease. But of course, customized pieces are available too. See it for yourself at the Almost Anything Wood showroom.\nMaybe you’re looking for your own live edge pieces. Almost Anything Wood has lumber in stock. It’s worth the drive to check out the ever changing selection of natural wood for your own live edge projects.\nBring your vision to the team at Almost Anything Wood and allow them to impress you with the skill and knowledge to transform your space and make your vision a reality.\nVisit their showroom at 205 Breadalbane Street, in downtown Fergus, or book a consultation at 519-843-7500.\nVisit their website at www.almostanythingwood.com and email any questions to firstname.lastname@example.org.

Here’s what they had to say.\n“Winning Architecture Designer of the Year is incredibly important to us.

{"id": "1055", "text": "Budget Gorilla trekking Uganda and Rwanda are a rare gem!\nTravelers seeking to track the endangered Mountain Gorillas in their natural habitat can enjoy cheaper experiences in East Africa.\nBecause of being an endangered species, trekking Mountain Gorillas is quite more costly than other African safari activities for example game drives in Queen Elizabeth National Park, Masai Mara, Serengeti, and Kruger.\nAlbeit the African tracking expeditions are relatively expensive, this article breaks down the possible ways of experiencing cheap adventures!\nIn the world, you can only have Mountain Gorilla tracking in Uganda, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and Rwanda.\nIn the high season, Gorilla permits are quite limited due to high demand. Therefore, it is important to book these Gorilla permits early enough.\nFor your affordable Gorilla safari trips, continue reading below to learn more:\nWhere to go gorilla tracking in Africa? There are only three countries in the world where you can experience Mountain Gorilla trekking safari trips. These African countries include Rwanda, Uganda, and the Democratic Republic of Congo.\nIn these sites/destinations are four national parks that are a natural habitat for the gentle giants thus where you can go for your African budget Gorilla safari adventures:\nBwindi Impenetrable National Park is the most famous East African destination for spotting Mountain Gorillas.\nBwindi National Park, a UNESCO world heritage site holds almost half of the Mountain Gorillas on Earth (1,063).\nMany of the Gorilla safari tours in Uganda at Bwindi Forest occur in the Buhoma Sector in the North. However, trekking in Ruhija, Rushaga, and Nkuringo sectors is also great.\nChildren above the age of 15 can also have Gorilla safari adventures in Bwindi Impenetrable Forest since the park is favorable for child-friendly tours. This is especially because of the relatively lower altitude of the Bwindi Forest terrain compared to other destinations.\nYou can inquire from your trusted tour operator about the experiences in Bwindi Impenetrable National Park and they can also help with booking your Gorilla permits.\nBwindi Impenetrable Forest/Bwindi National Park is also a birder’s paradise. There are over 350 birds in the park with over 90% of Albertine Rift Endemic bird species.\nNote that Bwindi Impenetrable National Park is the only park among all the tracking destinations where you can do the Gorilla habituation experience.\nThe Gorilla habituation experience in Bwindi National Park is an experience that allows you longer hours with the Mountain Gorillas and it is only done in the Rushaga sector in the South of Bwindi Impenetrable Forest and it is currently being done by the Bikingi Group.\nYour trips to Bwindi Impenetrable National Park can be combined with game-viewing experiences in Queen Elizabeth National Park which is one of the few places in the world where you can view the tree climbing Lions.\nVolcanoes National Park is the only wildlife destination to experience Rwanda Gorilla trips!\nVolcanoes National Park protects the highest number of Mountain gorillas in the Virunga Conservation Area. Other national parks in the Virunga Conservation Area are Uganda’s Mgahinga National Park and Virunga National Park in Congo.\nThere are about 12 habituated families for Gorilla trekking in Rwanda at Volcanoes National Park.\nOn your budget Gorilla trekking in Rwanda at Volcanoes National Park, you can go for a hike that takes you to the tomb of Dian Fossey. Dian Fossey was an American primatologist who fought to protect the Mountain Gorillas to prevent their extinction and died in the process of protecting them. Her grave is inside Volcanoes National Park\nAdditionally, you can consider Golden Monkey trekking or hiking Mount Karisimbi or Mount Bisoke.\nTo experience an unforgettable Gorilla safari, you can undertake a relaxation adventure at Lake Kivu after your tracking in Volcanoes National Park.\nMgahinga Gorilla National Park in Uganda is an alternative destination for your African budget Gorilla trekking tours.\nThere is one habituated group in this park with the highest number of Silverbacks which are 4 out of 9 members.\nYou can also add a golden Monkey trekking adventure to your African budget Gorilla trekking safari in Mgahinga Park, or hike one of 3 volcanoes in the park. These are Mount Muhabura (4127m), Sabinyo (3669m) and, Gahinga (3,474m).\nA relaxation boat trip and tour at Lake Bunyonyi usually follows your Uganda budget Gorilla tours in Bwindi National Park or Mgahinga Gorilla NP.\nThe Bunyonyi Lake boat cruise and exploration will thus give you time to relax and contemplate your amazing trip as you relax on one of the most beautiful lakes on the African continent.\nVirunga National Park of DR Congo is also another spot where you can enjoy your budget Gorilla trekking safari trips in the African continent.\nA tour operator will advise you on the safety measures to consider if you plan to visit Virunga NP for your Gorilla safari tours. This is because Congo is considered one of the unsafe African countries.\nTherefore unless for the need to explore both the Mountain Gorillas and the Eastern Lowland Gorillas which are only found In Congo, we advise that you undertake either a Uganda Gorilla trip in Bwindi national park or a Gorilla tour in Volcanoes National Park.\nBefore deciding to undertake a Gorilla trek in Congo, it is therefore advisable to first inquire about the safety.\nThis experience is a thrilling adventure no matter where you decide to undertake it; Bwindi National Park, Virunga NP, Volcanoes NP, or Mgahinga NP.\nOn the tracking day, you will have your delicious breakfast and head with your packed lunch to the park headquarters where you will receive a briefing about the dos and dont’s of the activity.\nYou will not just receive these guidelines but also spend time learning about the history of the park and the activity being done. The ranger will divide you into groups of 8 depending on your physical abilities, fitness, health history of the kind of experience that you would like to have.\nYour ranger will allow you to get a porter or walking stick if you need one to make the experience less strenuous.\nAfterward, a knowledgeable guide will lead you to the beautiful forest where he will enlighten you about the different wildlife like plants, birds, primates, and other animals.\nFinding a group will take long hours of about 2 to 6 hours and upon meeting a Gorilla family, you will spend a thrilling one hour with them as you study their way of life like feeding, young ones playing, challenging each other, picking fruits, and many others. You will also notice the human-like features of the Mountain Gorillas as awe at the teeth of the especially the Silverback.\nAfter one hour, you will return to the park headquarters to receive your certificate for completing such an amazing activity.\nYou will then be reunited with your driver guide who will lead you to your next destination.\nTracking Rules and Regulations in Uganda Rwanda\nFor every budget Gorilla trekking safari adventure in Uganda Rwanda, there are guidelines that you ought to follow to have a memorable experience!\nThe rules are set and put in place by professionals to protect both you and the primates and they include the following.\nTravelers on budget adventures should note that each country has a different cost for the Gorilla permit.

Our tour will include a visit to Mower’s Flea Market, a beloved enterprise with its own colorful history. (Okay, pop quiz time: What do Woodstock’s outdoor markets and the Maverick Concert Hall share in common? No, not bugs on certain afternoons. Both can trace their origins to Red Cross fundraisers held during World War I.) But if John Mower, her husband, answers the question, “Where was the concert held?” by saying, “Right here on the lawn,” as he’s wont to do with a wink, don’t believe him.\nMany of our walks have waxed nostalgic about Woodstock’s history as an arts colony, which is seen in the galleries, and as a Sixties mecca, which can’t be avoided, not with the tie-dye competition on Tinker Street. What I treasure about Janine is that she’s a historian of Woodstock as a real town, not just as a summer retreat of celebrated figures, but as a community where families have lived for generations, earning their livings by means that may have seemed ordinary at the time but seem extraordinary to us today, such as working in bluestone quarries or running summer boarding houses. In doing research for The Pocket Guide, I found Janine’s Woodstock history books invaluable. Her Mower family history has marvelous tales and details. (I’m still tickled by having read that “Albany ice cream” was once prized by youngsters in town. So there was life before Häagen-Dazs.) Janine’s two collections of historical photos, Woodstock and Woodstock Revisited, let us see more than words can convey. Yet when you talk with Janine, you sense that her passion for local history is more than a book project—it’s admiration for the many people and families whom she’s known.\nPlease join us for our final summer walk.

Creating content, running paid search ads, and sending out newsletters are some of the most common. But those are individual marketing tactics which won't produce the results you're looking for. The most successful way to market an edtech company is to approach your marketing in an integrated, holistic way—called full-funnel marketing.\nWhat is full-funnel marketing?\nWhen people buy something, it's usually not a straightforward decision. This is especially true in edtech marketing. Whether you're selling something to individual parents or a committee at a school, purchasing an edtech product is a big decision. And there is a consumer journey people go through when deciding what to buy.\nHere's a good visual from McKinsey of the consumer journey, entailing four stages: awareness, consideration, evaluation, loyalty.\nFull-funnel marketing is when you run marketing activities that cater to people at each step of the journey. The marketing activities are integrated to help move people along their buying journey and for a consistent customer experience.\nAt each step of the journey or funnel, people have a different mindset related to buying an edtech product. At the trigger/awareness stage, you'll get their attention with marketing that provides value to their lives or jobs, like a checklist or podcast episode. This is not the time to pitch your product.\nThey'll be more receptive to hearing about product solutions as they move along. At the consideration stage, you might run a contest or a live event to get people familiar with your product.\nPeople are in comparison mode when they get to the evaluation stage. They're figuring out how your product stacks up to competitors, so provide case studies and free trials.\nThe last stage is around loyalty, and it's a critical step for keeping and growing your existing customers and getting referrals to new customers. An informative newsletter and referral programs are helpful marketing activities for this stage.\nA full-funnel marketing strategy for an edtech company might look like this:\nWhen running a full-funnel marketing strategy, you will want to measure the overall success of the integrated campaign by identifying one or two KPIs (key performance indicators). For example, marketing contributions to revenue. This helps ensure that your marketing activities work together towards a universal goal.\nThen for the individual marketing tactics at each stage, measure performance so that you can test, learn, and improve along the way, which will contribute to your overall KPIs. For example, track participation in your referral program to keep a pulse on customer loyalty.\nThe best edtech marketing strategy\nThe only way that you will see marketing contribute to the goals of your edtech company is for you to commit to a full-funnel marketing strategy. You will have marketing activities that reach people at any stage of the buying process, and all of your marketing efforts will be connected to a common goal that helps grow your business.", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}
{"id": "1061", "text": "Tremfya vs Humira\nFor patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis or other chronic inflammatory conditions, certain drugs that target and inhibit specific proteins involved in the inflammatory process can help in reducing symptoms and improving overall quality of life. Tremfya and Humira are two such drugs often prescribed for these conditions. They each have a different mechanism of action but both work towards managing inflammation caused by overactive immune responses. Tremfya is a human monoclonal antibody that selectively binds to interleukin 23 (IL-23), a cytokine which plays a key role in managing the immune system and inflammation. Humira, on the other hand, is classified as an anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) agent; it works by blocking TNF-alpha, another protein involved in systemic inflammation found excessively in several autoimmune diseases.\nWhat is Tremfya?\nGuselkumab (the generic name for Tremfya) is a type of medication that belongs to the class of drugs known as interleukin inhibitors, which marked an important development from the earlier TNF-alpha inhibitor medications. Guselkumab was first approved by the FDA in 2017. It operates by targeting and blocking a specific protein in your body – IL-23 – thereby reducing inflammation and slowing down cell growth. It's prescribed primarily for treating moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adults who may benefit from taking systemic therapy or phototherapy.\nAdalimumab (the generic name for Humira), on the other hand, is a different type of biologic drug classified as a TNF-alpha inhibitor, which not only treats plaque psoriasis but also several other autoimmune conditions like rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn’s disease.\nWhile both these drugs are designed to help manage symptoms of various inflammatory conditions, they work differently within your immune system. Tremfya focuses specifically on IL-23, with no significant influence on other cytokines such as TNF-alpha or IL-17A; this targeted approach results in it having fewer side effects than broader-based treatments like Humira that affect multiple aspects of your immune response.\nWhat conditions is Tremfya approved to treat?\nTremfya has been approved for the treatment of several different conditions:\n- Moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adults who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy.\n- Active psoriatic arthritis in adults, used alone or in combination with a non-biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD).\nHumira is also approved for similar conditions and more. It's important to consult your healthcare provider before deciding on any medication.\nHow does Tremfya help with these illnesses?\nTremfya helps to manage psoriasis by selectively blocking the protein interleukin-23 (IL-23), a key factor in the overactive immune response that causes inflammation and skin cell proliferation associated with psoriasis. It does this by binding to IL-23, preventing it from interacting with its receptor on the surface of immune cells, thereby dampening down the inflammatory response. Inflammation is an integral process in our bodies' defense mechanisms, playing a critical role in healing and fighting off infections. However, when misdirected or overly active as seen in conditions like psoriasis, it can lead to damaging effects such as redness, swelling and discomfort among other symptoms related to this disease.\nTherefore by targeting IL-23 specifically rather than broadly suppressing the entire immune system —which could leave patients susceptible to infections— Tremfya offers a more focused approach towards limiting these unwanted effects of inflammation caused due to psoriasis and helping patients manage their condition more effectively.\nWhat is Humira?\nHumira, a brand name for adalimumab, is an anti-TNF alpha monoclonal antibody. This means it targets and inhibits the action of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα), a substance in the body that causes inflammation. Humira was first approved by the FDA in 2002 and has since been used to treat numerous conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and plaque psoriasis.\nUnlike Tremfya which specifically targets interleukin-23 (IL-23), another pro-inflammatory cytokine involved in autoimmune diseases like plaque psoriasis but not other inflammatory disorders treated by Humira. Due to its wider range of application - treating multiple immune-mediated inflammatory disorders - Humira may be chosen over Tremfya for patients with concurrent conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis or Crohn’s Disease.\nHowever, because it affects more pathways in the immune system than Tremfya does, there is potential for greater side effects with Humira use including infections due to immunosuppression which could potentially be serious. Nevertheless just like other medications benefits should always be weighed against potential risks when considering treatment options.\nWhat conditions is Humira approved to treat?\nHumira is a widely used medication that has received FDA approval for the treatment of several conditions, including:\n- Rheumatoid arthritis\n- Psoriatic arthritis\n- Ankylosing spondylitis\n- Crohn's disease in adults and children aged six and above.\n- Ulcerative colitis This multifaceted drug also treats plaque psoriasis in adults who are ready for systemic therapy or phototherapy.\nHow does Humira help with these illnesses?\nTumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) is a cytokine involved in systemic inflammation and is found to be increased in various autoimmune diseases. Humira, generically known as adalimumab, works by binding to TNF-alpha, effectively blocking its interaction with the cell surface receptors. Thus, it inhibits the inflammatory response that contributes to symptoms of conditions like rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis. Its mechanism of action differs from Tremfya which targets interleukin-23, another protein involved in immune responses. Because Humira has a broader scope of approved uses including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis among others—conditions not treated by Tremfya—it may be prescribed when patients have multiple co-existing autoimmune disorders or do not respond optimally to other medications.\nHow effective are both Tremfya and Humira?\nBoth guselkumab (Tremfya) and adalimumab (Humira) are established treatments for psoriasis, though they were approved by the FDA at different times with Humira being introduced first. They work via differing mechanisms of action, targeting separate aspects of the immune response that contributes to psoriasis; therefore, they may be prescribed under varying circumstances.\nThe effectiveness of Tremfya and Humira was directly studied in a double-blind clinical trial in 2017 known as the VOYAGE 1 study. Both drugs showed significant efficacy in managing symptoms of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. In this study, patients receiving Tremfya experienced higher rates of skin clearance compared to those on Humira after both 16 and 48 weeks.\nA review published in The Lancet reported that within one month from starting treatment with Guselkumab, patients saw an improvement in their symptoms with minimal side effects, demonstrating its rapid onset of action. This makes it a preferred choice for many clinicians when treating moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. Further studies have shown favorable results even among elderly populations who tend to experience more side effects with systemic therapies due to multiple comorbidities.\nWhile Adalimumab continues to be highly effective against various autoimmune disorders including rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn's disease alongside plaque psoriasis— making it one of the most widely used biologics worldwide —it falls behind Guselkumab specifically when treating psoriasis according to some metrics such as PASI-90 scores measuring severity reduction levels.\nDespite adalimumab's broader spectrum usage across several diseases leading it usually prescribed before or along other biologic agents like Tremfya—its use alone has been seen less robust than combining therapy where needed especially considering long-term management due its immunosuppressive nature which can cause serious infections over time. Nonetheless given unique profiles these medications offer diverse choices catering individual needs avoiding certain adverse events—for instance avoid triggering latent tuberculosis infection—a concern regarding Humira treatment.\nAt what dose is Tremfya typically prescribed?\nDosages of Tremfya (guselkumab) are typically administered as a 100 mg subcutaneous injection at the start, followed by another dose four weeks later and then every eight weeks thereafter. Studies have shown this to be an effective dosage for managing moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis in most adults. Similarly, Humira (adalimumab) is often initiated with a loading dose of 160 mg, usually given as four 40 mg injections in one day or two 40 mg injections per day for two days. Following the initial dosage, it's typically prescribed at 40 mg every other week. However, depending on the response and tolerability in individual patients, dosing frequency may need adjustment over time under doctor's guidance. It should be noted that both drugs are not recommended for use in children due to lack of clinical safety data.\nAt what dose is Humira typically prescribed?\nHumira treatment is generally initiated with a loading dose of 160mg, which can be administered as four injections in one day or two injections per day for two consecutive days. Afterwards, the typical dosing schedule comprises of a 80mg injection every other week starting one week after the initial dosage. For certain conditions like Psoriatic arthritis and Ankylosing spondylitis, the maintenance dose could be increased to 40mg every week or 80mg every other week. It's important that adjustments are based on individual patient response over time. If there’s little to no improvement observed within a few weeks of therapy initiation at this regimen, your healthcare professional may consider an alternative treatment approach.\nWhat are the most common side effects for Tremfya?\nCommon side effects that can occur with Tremfya include:\n- Upper respiratory infections\n- Injection site reactions (such as redness, swelling, and pain at the injection site)\nOn the other hand, Humira may cause:\n- Respiratory infections (such as sinusitis and pharyngitis)\n- Abdominal pain\n- Urinary tract infection\n- High blood pressure -Injection site reactions\nAlways consult your healthcare provider for any concerns about these potential side effects.\nAre there any potential serious side effects for Tremfya?\nWhen comparing Tremfya to Humira, it's vital to note the potential adverse effects of each. The serious side-effects associated with Tremfya may include:\n- Signs of an allergic reaction such as hives; difficulty breathing; swelling in your face or throat\n- New or worsening symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease (stomach pain, diarrhea, weight loss)\n- Symptoms related to infections: fever, chills, muscle aches, coughing up mucus or blood\n- Skin changes like redness where the medicine was injected\nOn the other hand, Humira might cause more severe reactions including:\n- A lupus-like syndrome - joint pain and swelling coupled with a rash on the cheeks or arms that worsens in sunlight.\n- Liver problems - nausea/upset stomach, fatigue/weakness/dizziness/lightheadedness which could lead to fainting spells and potentially jaundice.\n- Nervous system problems – numbness/tingling/sudden vision changes/seizures.\nRemember: If you experience any unusual health-related issues while taking either medication — even if they're not listed above — it’s always best to consult your healthcare provider promptly.\nWhat are the most common side effects for Humira?\nHumira, similar to Tremfya, is often used to treat conditions such as psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis. However, the side effects can be quite different. Some of the most common side effects of Humira include:\n- Respiratory infections including sinus infections and sore throat\n- Rash or skin reactions at the injection site\n- Nausea and abdominal pain\n- Increased risk for developing serious infections which may lead to hospitalization or death.\nIt's also worth noting that on rare occasions, some individuals may experience an allergic reaction to Humira resulting in hives, difficulty breathing or swelling of the face, lips tongue or throat. Furthermore, long term use of Humira can potentially lead to nerve damage causing tingling or a sensation of numbness throughout various parts of your body.\nAre there any potential serious side effects for Humira?\nWhile Humira is a widely used medication, it does come with potential risks. Severe side effects may include:\n- Signs of allergic reaction: hives; difficulty breathing; swelling of your face, lips, tongue, or throat.\n- Serious infections symptoms: fever, sweats or chills, muscle aches, cough that doesn't go away or leads to shortness of breath and severe fatigue.\n- Nervous system problems such as multiple sclerosis-like syndrome manifesting as changes in vision or speech; weakness on one side of the body; neck stiffness; loss of balance.\n- Heart failure signs like shortness of breath (especially when lying down), sudden weight gain due to fluid retention and swelling in ankles or feet.\n- Liver problems including jaundice (yellowing skin/eyes), dark urine and upper abdominal pain.\nIf you experience any such serious side effects while using Humira, immediately contact your healthcare provider.\nContraindications for Tremfya and Humira?\nTremfya and Humira, like most medications for autoimmune conditions, may worsen symptoms in some people. If you notice your condition worsening or if you experience severe side effects such as persistent fever, bruising or bleeding easily, shortness of breath, or changes in skin appearance (rashes or lesions), please seek immediate medical attention.\nNeither Tremfya nor Humira should be taken if you are taking, have been recently vaccinated with a live vaccine or plan to get one soon. It's imperative that your doctor knows about all the medications and treatments you are receiving; live vaccines need time to clear from the system to prevent dangerous interactions with Tremfya and Humira.\nDue to their immunosuppressive nature, both drugs increase susceptibility to infections – this includes common ones like flu and serious ones like tuberculosis. Therefore it is important that any signs of infection be immediately reported to a healthcare provider.\nIt is also worth noting that while both drugs can help manage psoriasis symptoms by reducing inflammation in the body; they work differently at a molecular level which results in different efficacy profiles for patients based on their individual health status.\nHow much do Tremfya and Humira cost?\nFor the brand name versions of these drugs:\n- The price for one syringe (100 mg) of Tremfya averages around $5800, which works out to approximately $1933/month since it's administered once every four weeks.\n- The price for two pens (40 mg each) of Humira is about $5157, working out to roughly $2578/month as it typically needs administering every other week.\nThus, if you are considering monthly cost, then Tremfya may be less expensive than Humira on a per-month treatment basis. However, please note that cost should not be a primary consideration in determining which drug is right for you.\nAs biologic medications, there currently aren't generic versions available for either Tremfya or Humira due to their complex molecular structures and manufacturing processes. It's important to remember that while prices can vary widely depending on insurance coverage and pharmacy location, both medications have programs designed to help reduce costs for eligible patients.\nPopularity of Tremfya and Humira\nAdalimumab, sold under the brand name Humira among others, is a medication used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and plaque psoriasis. In 2020 alone, it was estimated that about 5 million people in the US were treated with Adalimumab making it one of the most commonly prescribed biologics for autoimmune diseases.\nGuselkumab or Tremfya on the other hand is primarily used to manage moderate-to-severe forms of plaque psoriasis. While not as widely utilized as Humira due to its narrower range of indications and its later introduction to market (FDA approved in 2017), Guselkumab has been recognized for its effectiveness specifically against plaque psoriasis. It has seen steady growth since its debut with approximately half a million prescriptions written in 2020. Both drugs have different mechanisms of action though both are part of the larger group known as biologics.\nBoth Tremfya (guselkumab) and Humira (adalimumab) have been approved to manage moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, and certain other inflammatory conditions. Their efficacy is backed by multiple clinical trials showing that they are more effective than placebo treatments. It is uncommon for these drugs to be combined due to their similar mechanisms of action - both being biologics that target specific proteins involved in the inflammatory process.\nTremfya targets a protein called IL-23 while Humira inhibits TNF-alpha; as such, they are prescribed under different circumstances based on patient response or disease specifics. While there's no hard rule about which comes first, often physicians consider factors like insurance coverage and the presence of comorbidities when deciding between them.\nAs with most biologic medications, neither drug has a generic form available at this time, meaning out-of-pocket costs can be high if the medication isn't covered under your insurance plan.\nStarting treatment with either Tremfya or Humira may not result in immediate symptom relief; an adjustment period can be expected before effects become noticeable.\nThe side effect profiles of Tremfya and Humira do share similarities but also show differences based on their mechanism of action. With both drugs patients should monitor for signs of infection as these medications can lower your ability to fight infections. Any new symptoms or worsening condition should warrant immediate medical attention.", "scores": {"score": 3, "score_transform_1": 5, "score_transform_2": 5, "score_transform_3": 0}}

The decision was welcome news for Washington Legal Foundation (WLF), which filed an amicus brief in the case urging reversal. WLF’s brief was prepared and filed with assistance from Kenneth Gage and Daniel Richards of Paul Hastings LLP and Michael Vild and David Holmes of Cross & Simon LLP.\nThe appeal arose from a suit by former partners of Cantor Fitzgerald over their partnership agreement. The agreement contained a “forfeiture for competition” (FFC) provision. Under that provision, a former partner forfeits the right to additional capital disbursements if he engages in competitive activity during a four-year period during which he receives annual payouts from his capital account. Applying “reasonableness review,” the Chancery Court held that the agreement’s FFC provision was unreasonable and therefore invalid.\nIt its amicus brief urging reversal, WLF argued that the Chancery Court’s holding is at odds with Delaware law’s strong preference for freedom of contract. In its unanimous opinion today, the Delaware Supreme Court agreed: “When sophisticated actors avail themselves of the contractual flexibility embodied in the Delaware Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act . . . and agree that a departing partner will forfeit a specified benefit should he engage in competition with the partnership, our courts should, absent unconscionability, bad faith, or other extraordinary circumstances, hold them to their agreements.”", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

The PTO took the position that the mark READY BREW did not possess the necessary distinctive character for these goods, as it could indicate that the goods were ready-brewed drinks.\nStarbucks presented two lines of arguments to the PTO:\n- the mark had acquired distinctive character through extensive use; and\n- the mark was inherently distinctive.\nBoth arguments were unsuccessful. Acquired distinctiveness could not be proven, and the PTO held that the word 'ready' means 'finished' or 'done', while 'brew' is synonymous with 'coffee' in expressions such as 'morning brew' or 'a cup of brew'. The words 'ready' and 'brew' in combination were found not to have sufficient distinctive character in respect of “non-alcoholic coffee-based beverages”.\nStarbucks brought the matter before the Board of Appeal with regard to the issue of inherent distinctiveness. Starbucks argued that the mark READY BREW was a suggestive reference to 'instant coffee' or 'soluble coffee', and that it could be seen as a rephrasing of 'ready go'. Furthermore, it argued that consumers would need to use their imagination to understand the mark as being a reference to instant coffee or an invitation to start brewing some coffee. Starbucks referred to the fact that OHIM had accepted the mark, which is registered as a Community trademark (Registration No 8135601) for the goods in question.\nThe Board of Appeal was not convinced and confirmed the decision by the PTO. It remains to be seen whether Starbucks will bring the matter before the courts.\nThis decision is yet another example that the assessment of distinctive character can still vary between the trademark offices of the European Union despite the harmonisation efforts, and that the question of distinctive character should be decided separately for each individual type of goods and services. Arguably, due to the unpredictability of this subject, there will always be scope for an argument on the issue of distinctiveness.\nLisbet Andersen, Bech-Bruun, Copenhagen\nCopyright © Law Business ResearchCompany Number: 03281866 VAT: GB 160 7529 10", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}
{"id": "1068", "text": "by WorldTribune Staff, November 12, 2018\nWhile the Left has been quick to attribute the deadly California wildfires to climate change, forestry analysts say poor land management and environmental regulations which limited logging are the main reasons behind the increase in devastating wildfires.\nGov. Jerry Brown said wildfires were part of a “new normal” because of global warming.\nThe Sacramento Bee editorial board said “This is climate change, for real and in real time. We were warned that the atmospheric buildup of man-made greenhouse gas would eventually be an existential threat.”\nBut Forester Bob Zybach said he warned government officials decades ago that allowing forests to grow unchecked by proper management would result in catastrophic wildfires.\nZybach said the Clinton administration in 1994 introduced a plan to protect old growth trees and spotted owls by strictly limiting logging.\nThat plan, Zybach said, ignored history and would fuel “wildfires reminiscent of the Tillamook burn, the 1910 fires and the Yellowstone fire.”\n“We knew exactly what would happen if we just walked away,” Zybach, an experienced forester with a PhD in environmental science, told The Daily Caller.\nPresident Donald Trump tweeted on Nov. 10: “There is no reason for these massive, deadly and costly forest fires in California except that forest management is so poor.”\nTrump said he may restrict California’s wildfire funding if actions aren’t taken to limit fires.\nIn a recent tweet, Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke said: “Fires across the west are burning hotter and more intense. The overload of dead and diseased timber in the forests makes the fires worse and more deadly. We must be able to actively manage our forests and not face frivolous litigation when we try to remove these fuels.”\nUniversity of Washington climate scientist Cliff Mass told The Daily Caller that “Many of the media and some politicians have been pushing a false narrative: that the fires are mainly about global warming. They are not.”\nMass added: “Global warming may contribute slightly, but the key factors are mismanaged forests, years of fire suppression, increased population, people living where they should not, invasive flammable species, and the fact that California has always had fire.”\nChuck DeVore, a former California assemblyman who served in the California Army National Guard for two decades, said the problem with the narrative that global warming is to blame for the fires is that making a passionate argument is no substitute for the truth.\n“Some two decades ago, California produced so much wood waste from its timber operations, including brush and small trees from thinning efforts, that the resulting renewable biomass powered electric generating plants across the length of the state,” DeVore wrote for Forbes. “But cheap, subsidized solar power, combined with air quality concerns (wood doesn’t burn as cleanly as natural gas) and a lack of fuel due to cutbacks in logging, led to the closure of many biomass generators. What used to be burned safely in power generators is now burned in catastrophic fires. Including the growing capture and use of landfill methane as a fuel, California’s biomass energy generation last year was 22 percent lower than it was 25 years before.”\nThe issue was summarized by the Western Governors’ Association in their 2006 Biomass Task Force Report which noted:\n“…over time the fire-prone forests that were not thinned, burn in uncharacteristically destructive wildfires, and the resulting loss of forest carbon is much greater than would occur if the forest had been thinned before fire moved through. …failing to thin leads to a greater greenhouse gas burden than the thinning created in the first place, and that doesn’t even account for the avoided fossil fuel greenhouse gas emissions due to the production of energy from the forest thinnings. In the long term, leaving forests overgrown and prone to unnaturally destructive wildfires means there will be significantly less biomass on the ground, and more greenhouse gases in the atmosphere”\nDeVore concluded that: “Whether global climate change is a problem that can be solved by California is a dubious proposition – one year’s worth of emission growth in China is greater than California’s total emissions. But the action needed to reduce the state’s growing forest fire threat would be the same regardless of one’s belief in any problems posed by climate change: start managing our forests again.”", "scores": {"score": 3, "score_transform_1": 5, "score_transform_2": 5, "score_transform_3": 0}}

While some Domestic Shorthairs may be calm and quiet, others may be more vocal and outgoing. Some are energetic while others are relaxed. Ultimately, a well-socialised Domestic Shorthair will be a fur-bulous companion in any cat-loving family.

They especially enjoy keeping one eye on the creatures outside and the other on their humans in the home! Once they're comfortable and have a good sense of their surroundings, this cat loves to curl up in the nearest lap for a snooze.\nHowever, despite not having a pedigree, this breed still boasts a purr-fectly rich history. It's believed the DSH was first domesticated in ancient Egypt around 2000 BC, while their roots can also be traced to the early days of pioneer settlement in North America. They were considered 'working cats' because of their dedication to helping catch rats and were even brought on voyage ships such as the Mayflower in order to help with rodent control. These furry hunters took care of vermin issues that settlers faced in the New World and in return were given a good meal, a warm bed, and lots of love from their humans - the rest is hiss-tory!\nWhile these cats still enjoy hunting – and even presenting their 'prizes' to their humans - they are now more commonly kept as loving companions, and are one of the most popular pets around today. Though these cats come in a vast range of sizes and colours they do have one very important thing in common; they're adored by their families. Even though their status might mean that Domestic Shorthair cats are not eligible for official showing, they're still accepted by Cat Fanciers' Association (CFA) in the Household Pets category, where they can compete for the Grand Household Pet of the year award.

{"id": "1077", "text": "14 Jul What is Traditional Thai Yoga Massage?\nHistory Thai Yoga Massage actually originates in Northern India around 2,500 years ago, at the time of Buddha. It was practiced in Buddhist temples as a form of healing and an extension of Theravada Buddhist practice, specifically meditation. When the Buddhists left India and travelled to Thailand they took this practice with them. When we give a Thai Yoga Massage we are focused solely on the receiver and what they need from us as the therapist. We are practicing mindfulness as well as “Metta” or “loving kindness” meditation.\nThe treatment works on “Sen” lines or energy lines in the body. When these energetic pathways are blocked physical or mental illness or pain occurs. Thai Yoga Massage is used to heal and prevent illness. The energetic pathways in Thai Yoga Massage are very different to those in traditional Chinese and Japanese practises such as Acupuncture and Shiatsu. Thai Yoga Massage has much more in common with the traditional yogic energetic system.\nWhat can I expect from a treatment? The full treatment takes two hours which is highly recommended to get the full benefit but shorter treatments are offered. Traditional Thai Yoga Massage is quite different from a lot of the more “westernised” treatments on offer today. Recently I booked a treatment in a Thai massage centre in London and specifically asked for traditional Thai Yoga Massage. I was really disappointed to receive a Swedish style massage with a couple of stretches thrown in!\nA Traditional Thai Yoga Massage is done fully clothes and you will lie on a comfortable futon on the floor. The treatment works from the feet upwards. I apply strong pressure to the body “palming” the energy lines. This can feel quite intense but also soothing. I bring you into yoga stretches to release tension in the whole body. As someone who has practiced yoga every day for years I find that these stretches reach the parts yoga can’t!\nThe treatment works on balancing energy and is a wonderful treatment for stress and anxiety.\nHow does it differ from a deep tissue or Swedish massage? Thai Yoga massage is also known as “Lazy man’s yoga” the treatment works on restoring balance and harmony bringing you to optimum health in body and mind. The applied stretches release tension and literally allow everything to flow as it should. We tune into the needs of the receiver and apply a treatment specifically for you.\nThe Traditional Thai Yoga massage treatment will always include the stomach. For some reason, the more westernised treatments always miss out the stomach massage which is a shame as all of the energy lines run through the tummy. As someone who has experienced quite serious stomach issues in the past, I find the stomach massage incredibly healing.\nDo I need to be flexible? Absolutely not! Most people I work on do not practice yoga and would consider themselves to be fairly stiff. I have treated marathon runners and sports people as well as people who experience stiffness due to sitting at a desk all day. The treatment works wonders and has encouraged many to take up yoga.\nWhat can it treat? You don’t have to have aches and pains or feel unwell to benefit from a treatment! The treatment will leave you feeling, lighter, more flexible and calm. Thai Yoga Massage can successfully treat anxiety and stress insomnia, muscular and pains, IBS, migraines…the list is endless!\nAbout the author…Fiona is an Ashtanga Yoga student and teacher as well as an experienced Thai massage therapist. “I am incredibly lucky to have trained with the UK’s most experienced Thai Yoga Massage therapist and teacher, Kira Balasakas who’s dedication to keeping the spirit of true Thai Yoga Massage alive is an inspiration.”", "scores": {"score": 3, "score_transform_1": 5, "score_transform_2": 5, "score_transform_3": 0}}
{"id": "1078", "text": "When we upgraded to our new organic mattress this week, it left us with a spare queen mattress that we had no use for. We considered a few options for getting rid of it – selling it on craigslist, donating it to Goodwill, etc. But in the end we decided it was the perfect opportunity to give Freecycle a try.\nFreecycle is a system you guys actually taught us about. It’s a network of locally run message boards where people can exchange unwanted items for free. It’s a pretty simple concept, but it seems to work very well at keeping unwanted items out of landfills. Heck, the Richmond chapter alone has over 150,000 listings posted (you can find the closest chapter to your hometown right here). We joined the Richmond list months ago to learn the ropes, but hadn’t actively participated until this past weekend (thanks to our mattress situation). Here’s how our first adventure in Freecycling went down:\nOn Sunday afternoon I posted this simple message on the Richmond Freecycle board based on the guidelines of the group: “OFFER: Queen Mattress, Bon Air. Queen mattress (Sealy brand) in fair condition, just upgraded to organic mattress and don’t need it anymore…” It’s a super easy formula to follow. Just lead with the word “OFFER” if you have something to give or “WANTED” if you’re seeking something to receive. After that it’s just a quick description of the item and your location.\nLucky us, our offer of a free queen-sized mattress tickled someone’s fancy almost immediately. It took just one hour for someone to respond to my listing (via Yahoo! Chat, oh technology).\nNow, it’s worth mentioning that it’s smart to exercise a bit of caution when arranging meet-ups with strangers (need we mention the recent horror stories about craiglist?). Some people may prefer to meet in a public place, but with a mattress and a small car it didn’t really make sense for us (but we were certain to coordinate the exchange for a time when Sherry and I were both home during daylight hours. And we of course kept our loud-mouthed guard dog nearby). So we gave our free-mattress-hunter some quick directions to our house and got his free gift ready for pick up on the porch.\nThe guy arrived about 20 minutes later with his wife, son and truck. We learned that they had been put in a tight spot because their landlord had defaulted on his payments, giving them almost zero notice that there were being kicked out. They barely had enough time to pack more than a few bags before they were essentially homeless (and completely bedless). This free mattress meant they no longer had to sleep on the hard floor of their new place. You can imagine how happy we were to watch it ride away with a family in need, absolutely no money exchanged. We smiled for the rest of the day.\nThen all that was left to do was to post our follow-up “TAKEN” message (meaning the previously offered item is no longer available). It felt almost unreal that we were doing it a mere 90 minutes after posting our “OFFER.” So what’s our take on Freecycle after our first swap session? Quick, simple, and win-win. It’s all about people coming together to help each other out (strangers no less) while keeping things out of landfills. What’s not to like about that?\nHave any of you had good experiences with Freecyle in your area – either giving or receiving something for zero, zilch, nada? We can’t wait to keep an eye out for a free item that we might need (perhaps one that needs a makeover…) – after all, we figure we’ve earned a few good karma points towards something, right?", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}

{"id": "1082", "text": "By R. Scott Rappold\nJ.B. Bissell paused to contemplate. Were he and his two boys in in excess of their heads?\nThough he grew up skiing in Colorado, he’d never ever been to Wolf Creek, a southern Colorado resort legendary for its deep powder – they get 450 inches a 12 months – and severe hike-to terrain. To the uninitiated skier who has hiked and traversed on the windswept Knife Ridge, the dizzyingly steep runs can seem barely skiable, if not downright harmful.\nBut they had come all this way, so why not? They felt their way down, traversed close to the sketchy components, and hit some sweet cliff jumps. 1 area was so steep that soon after Bissell somersaulted out of both skis, he told his little ones to get theirs off and crawl down.\nThen Bissell realized a harsh lesson about the Wolf Creek powder: 1 of his boys’ skis had vanished in the snow. Following an hour of seeking, they gave up and went down for lunch.\nThat was back in early December. By late April, Bissell and his boys Dade, 13, and Roan, twelve, had fulfilled a dream of skiing every single single ski location in Colorado, from the mega-mountains of the Aspen region to tiny hills like Echo Mountain.\nMost skiers, for financial or geographical factors, spend their winters skiing the same number of mountains. For Bissell, it was about stepping out of that comfort zone and exhibiting his boys what Colorado really has to offer.\n“When you are skiing black runs and double blacks, part of the enjoyable is that adrenaline rush. You type of shed sight of that when you ski the identical spot all the time,” explained Bissell. “I enjoy skiing the chutes at Steamboat, but due to the fact I’ve skied it so a lot I kind of know what I’m obtaining into.”\nBissell, a writer in the Denver region, had lengthy desired to write about skiing each and every hill in Colorado. But he could by no means sell the story.\nThis winter, he purchased Roan the Colorado Ski Nation USA sixth Grade Passport, which for $ 115 gives four days at twenty distinct ski places. This was the yr.\n“I thought, ‘This would be something that would be truly excellent to do with the boys,’” explained Bissell. “This was the best winter to do it, in terms of timing, and how previous they are.”\nThe primary rule was that the kids couldn’t miss any school. That wasn’t considerably of a difficulty as they started to whittle away at the I-70 corridor and Front Variety ski areas. Their Rocky Mountain Super Passes presented the skiing at Copper Mountain, Winter Park, Steamboat, Eldora and Crested Butte. He produced good use of his GEMS Card, also sold by Colorado Ski Nation USA, which supplies 2-for-1 discount rates at eight of Colorado’s nostalgic and less ritzy ski regions.\nHis dentist, a ski patroller at Loveland, hooked him up with a ticket there. A lawyer he is aware of in Glenwood Springs got him a ticket at Sunlight Mountain.\nTake a trip from Denver to the San Juan Mountains and you will realize just how huge this state is.\nMost of the journeys had been not planned far in advance, so they could chase the best snow. But this 1 had to be on a vacation weekend. It did not disappoint. Hitting Telluride, Purgatory and Silverton in one particular extended weekend – 1,000 miles on the road – was exhausting but worth it.\nIt took two weekends to ski the 4 mountains of Aspen Snowmass. They hit Powderhorn and Sunlight in one more lengthy street journey. Same for Cooper, Crested Butte and Monarch. Life on such a schedule was fundamentally “ski, rest, drive, ski once more.” Time only permitted one particular day at every single region, providing just a taste of what they had to offer. But the children never ever complained.\n“It was a excellent adventure for them and they never ever did get sick of it,” said Bissell. Dade agrees. The official loved ones line was their favourite day was wherever they have been at that day, but Silverton Mountain was in a league of its personal. Rustic and forbidding, with just 1 chair lift and some of the gnarliest in-bounds terrain in Colorado, Dade easily picked that as his preferred.\n“It was hard but at the exact same time the people that perform there were fantastic. They had been exciting to hang out with,” explained Dade.\nHe was asked if the winter, exploring new mountains, manufactured him a better skier.\n“Yes. I had to be a lot more conscious of exactly where I was skiing and what I was undertaking,” the 13-year-outdated said.\nA Ski is Found\nEvery single skier knows that awkwardness of skiing a completely new mountain, so he would request an individual who looked like a nearby, or possibly a liftie, for the best tips. Then they would get a trail map and aim for what looked like the toughest terrain. Which led them to the aforementioned Knife Ridge at Wolf Creek.\nSoon after Dade managed to ski to the lodge for lunch on one ski, dad and a good friend went back out to appear for the ski. As he wrote in his site:\n“Thirty minutes ticked by — walking our search grid, not poking all around Glory Hole — and then I heard Tedford shout, ‘That’s it! I quit!’ I looked up and a lone ski was hurtling towards me (this time, I’m relatively particular he was throwing it at me, and once again, that’s fair). ‘This mountain experimented with to steal from us, J, and we just kicked its ass.’\nI’m not certain we kicked its ass, but I am optimistic we had an journey, and man, that is what this is all about.”\nBissell blogged about their exclusive Colorado Ski Country journey all the way.

{"id": "1083", "text": "Vet charity PDSA have issued a safety warning regarding the dangers of BBQ leftovers, ahead of this years National BBQ Day.\nPDSA vets are warning about the dangers barbecue leftovers can pose to pets this National BBQ Day (Tuesday 16 May) after a beloved dog needed emergency treatment to remove a chicken bone that had become wedged in his mouth.\nSeven-year-old Jack Russell Billy got his paws on fragments of chicken bone – believed to have been scavenged from a local barbecue – and attempted to wolf them down.\nHis owner, Frank Menzies (58), noticed Billy’s distress when he spotted his beloeved rescue dog frantically pawing at his mouth and making a chewing motion.\nFrank, who lives in Brighton, explained: “Billy was in the back garden and was rubbing his mouth with his paw as though trying to dislodge something. I went out to investigate and he looked me straight in the eyes before rolling onto his side on the ground. I immediately realised something was very wrong so I picked him up and took him to the PDSA Pet Hospital as quickly as I could.”\nDespite Frank’s swift action, Billy was in a lot of pain and discomfort by the time the pair arrived. After examining Billy, PDSA vets discovered a chicken bone had become wedged behind his lower back teeth.\nFrank added: “The PDSA team were excellent. They could see that Billy was in a lot of pain and told me that he needed an emergency procedure, which I agreed to without hesitation. The vet was extremely kind and said he would call me as soon as there was an update. I went home and paced up and down the garden for the next few hours, just waiting for news.”\nBilly was sedated to allow the bone to be safely removed and x-rays were carried out, revealing additional bone fragments in his stomach. Thankfully, the procedure was a success and Billy returned home later that evening with pain relief and advice to rest.\nPDSA Vet Claire Roberts said: “Billy was in a great deal of pain when he arrived at the Pet Hospital, his mouth was so sore that he couldn’t be properly examined. The team had to sedate him so that the bone could be successfully removed and, luckily, there was no damage to his mouth or throat. X-rays of Billy’s stomach identified tiny bone fragments so Frank was advised to feed him bulky food to encourage their safe passage through his digestive system.\n“Billy was extremely lucky that the bone in his mouth and the ones in his stomach didn’t cause any serious damage. It is cases such as this that highlight the importance of clearing away any debris, including skewers, bones, and litter, after enjoying a barbecue. What may be some harmless fun in the sun for us can easily have disastrous consequences for pets and wild animals.”\nPDSA is warning pet owners of many other potential hazards to think about when organising a barbecue this summer.\n- Dangers of heatstroke\nPets can quickly overheat in warm weather, so it’s important to keep your furry friends cool while they’re enjoying time outside.\nSigns of heatstroke can vary from excessive panting, confusion, bright red gums, foaming at the mouth, collapse or even seizures. It’s important to ensure your pet can easily head indoors or find some shade when they need to cool down. If your pet is a sun-worshipper, you may need to shut them indoors to prevent overheating.\nIf you’re planning to host a barbecue on a particularly hot day, consider scheduling an evening soirée instead, when the temperature should be cooler. You can also provide a pet paddling pool so your furry friend can hop in for a refreshing dip. It’s important that they also have access to fresh, clean water at all times, so they can stay hydrated.\n- Create a safe space\nHaving a house full of strangers can be unsettling for our pets, so make sure they can retreat to a comfortable, safe space to relax in peace. Set up a quiet area in a room or corner of the garden, making sure they have access to food, water and a couple of their favourite toys.\n- Paw-ping hot\nAlways keep pets a safe distance from a barbecue. Hot food, oils, coals, and ashes can cause severe burns if they come into contact with their skin, so ensure the grill is cooled down immediately once you finish cooking – being careful not to leave four-legged friends alone while there are still hot items in the area.”\nFrank added: “I can’t thank PDSA enough for helping Billy – he means the world to me. My circumstances changed dramatically, and pretty much overnight, when I had two heart attacks and the doctor told me that I had to give up work. With the rising cost of living and everything going up, it is a weight off my mind to know that I can rely on PDSA to help Billy should anything go wrong with him. Everyone at Brighton PDSA Pet Hospital is so caring and professional – the team always puts the health and welfare of the pet they are treating first and I know Billy is in safe hands when he is there.”\nIn times of hardship pets like Billy will still fall ill or become injured and need emergency care. While Billy’s owner contributed what he could towards his treatment, the total cost of his care came to over £200. PDSA is appealing for donations so that the charity can continue to provide life-saving care to vulnerable pets, whose owners have nowhere else to turn.

{"id": "1086", "text": "In the Internet of Things (IoT) and remote sensing applications, it is crucial to choose the appropriate wireless communication technology. The LoRa (low-power WAN) module attracts much attention because of its low-power consumption, long-distance communication, and wide coverage. This paper explores the communication range of the LoRa modules and compares it with other wireless communication technologies such as Wi-Fi and Bluetooth.\nCommunication range of the LoRa module\nThe LoRa technology adopts a method called spread frequency modulation, which enables it to achieve a far communication range under low power consumption conditions. Here are the key factors affecting the range of LoRa communication:\n1. Working frequency\nLoRa modules usually operate in different frequency bands, such as 433 MHz, 868 MHz, 915 MHz, etc. Lower frequency bands usually have a further communication range, but correspondingly lower data transmission rates.\n2. Transmission power\nThe LoRa module supports adjustable transmission power, allowing adjustment of the communication range to the specific application requirements. Higher transmission power usually means a further communication distance, but requires more energy.\n3. Receiving sensitivity\nThe high reception sensitivity of the LoRa module enables it to receive signals in a lower signal-NR environment, further expanding the communication range.\n4. The antenna performance\nExcellent antenna design can improve the communication performance of the LoRa modules, especially in complex environments.\nComparison of LoRa with Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth\n1. Communication range\nLoRa: Provide a large communication range, several kilometers to tens of kilometers.\nWi-Fi: usually in the range of tens to 100 meters, limited by high power consumption and high data transmission rate.\nBluetooth: Usually in the range of 10 to 100 meters, suitable for near-field communication.\n2. Power consumption\nLoRa: Known for its low power consumption, it is suitable for long-life battery power supply devices.\nWi-Fi: High power consumption, suitable for applications that require a high data transmission rate.\nBluetooth: Low power Bluetooth (BLE) is suitable for low power applications, but at a low transmission rate.\n3. Data transmission rate\nLoRa: lower data transmission rate, suitable for periodic, low-frequency data transmission.\nWi-Fi: to provide a high data transmission rate, suitable for video streams such as large data transmission.\nBluetooth: Provide medium data transfer rate for the transfer of smaller data packets.\nWith its remote communication range and low power consumption characteristics, the LoRa module becomes an ideal choice for Internet of Things applications and remote sensing systems. However, the selection of communication technology should weigh various factors according to the specific application requirements, including communication range, power consumption, data transmission rate, etc. In different scenarios, wireless technologies such as LoRa, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth can work together to meet different levels of communication needs.\nThis article is reprinted by MinewSemi innovation micro\nAdd: 1501-3, Building F03, Phase III, Software Park, Jimei District, Xiamen City, Fujian Province, China", "scores": {"score": 4, "score_transform_1": 5, "score_transform_2": 5, "score_transform_3": 0}}

Our network is rich with skilled professionals who provide urgent dental care, even on Sundays. By contacting us, you’ll quickly be connected to a nearby dentist who can offer you the immediate treatment you need, minimizing the risk of complications and helping alleviate your discomfort.\nCan the ER do anything for tooth pain?\nWhile the emergency room can provide some level of pain relief for toothaches, it’s important to understand that most ERs don’t have a dentist on staff. They may administer pain relief medication or antibiotics to address infection, but they typically can’t perform dental procedures. For a toothache or any dental emergency, contacting a specialized dental service like 1-800-DENTIST® will ensure you receive the most appropriate care for your condition. We’ll connect you with a professional who’s equipped to handle dental emergencies specifically.\nCan I go to the emergency room for tooth pain?\nYes, you can visit the emergency room for tooth pain, particularly if it’s severe or accompanied by fever, swelling, or signs of infection.

We are committed to directing patients to emergency dental services that can address the root cause of pain and offer remedies that an ER might not be equipped to provide.\nHow much does it cost to remove a tooth?\nThe cost of tooth extraction varies widely and can depend on factors such as the complexity of the procedure, the location of the dentist’s office, and whether you have dental insurance. Simple extractions can be more affordable, while surgical removal of impacted teeth will be at the higher end of the cost spectrum. We at 1-800-DENTIST® advise discussing cost and payment options beforehand with the dentist we connect you to, as many will offer a clear outline of expenses and payment plans to help manage the financial aspect of dental care.\nWhat services can I expect from a dentist on a Sunday?\nThe services offered by Sunday dentists can vary, but typically, you can expect emergency care such as pain relief, treatment for infections, and temporary fixes for damaged dental devices. Every dentist in our network has been meticulously screened, ensuring that even on a Sunday, you’ll receive high-standard treatment. We make sure you have access to professionals who can tackle a wide range of dental emergencies, reframing the concept of weekend dental care.\nHow can I ensure I’m selecting the right Sunday Dentist for my needs?\nSelecting the right Sunday dentist is about matching your specific dental emergency with the provider’s expertise. When you reach out to us, we take into account your location, the nature of your dental issue, and the dentist’s availability to treat it promptly. We empower you by providing questions for you to discuss with the dentist, ensuring their expertise aligns with your individual needs. This personalized connection sets us apart and helps ensure you receive the most appropriate care.\nWhat should I do if my dental concern is urgent, but not necessarily an emergency?\nIf you’re uncertain whether your dental concern qualifies as an emergency, it’s best to err on the side of caution and seek consultation. Contacting us at 1-800-DENTIST® provides you with immediate access to advice and, if necessary, rapid referral to a dentist who can determine the seriousness of your situation. Prompt professional assessment can prevent potential escalation, saving you time and discomfort in the long run.\nWhat role does an Emergency Dentist Office play in dental care?\nAn Emergency Dentist Office is a critical player in the dental healthcare system. It acts as a prompt responder to acute dental situations that require immediate attention, such as tooth extractions, treating infections, or addressing injuries. The offices we partner with are equipped to manage such emergencies, offering relief and treatment outside of normal business hours, ensuring that no patient has to endure extended periods of pain or risk further complications by having to wait for routine dental office hours.\nWhat should I expect once the immediate dental emergency is addressed?\nAfter the immediate dental emergency has been managed, it’s important to take steps toward longer-term dental health. The emergency office we connect you with will provide guidance on follow-up care, which may include additional treatments, recovery tips, and maintenance advice. Our commitment to your oral health extends beyond the emergency, and we’ll aid you in finding a regular dentist for ongoing care and maintenance of your dental health.", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}
{"id": "1103", "text": "Everyone knows for sure what SEO website promotion is. And many of you have tried to work on this in one way or another in order to improve your site’s search engine rankings. The site is meaningless without its promotion. Without optimization, the traffic of the resource will be very low or even zero if other methods of attracting traffic are not used. Those who work on website promotion face many myths. This is no coincidence. The SEO myths for 2023 still prevent many from working and getting good results.\nHowever, SEO today and 10 years ago are 2 completely different areas of work. Search algorithms in systems change periodically, new filters and functions replace the old ones. The goals of search engines are clear and adequate – to provide users with optimal search results and earn more on contextual advertising. SEO specialists, in turn, have no choice but to accept the new rules of the game. The new SEO myths for 2023 aren’t just spreading fast. Many of them are already outdated, so it is important to know them and not succumb to general panic.\nWhat is SEO website promotion?\nSEO is suitable for everyone who is going to or is already selling goods via the Internet, looking for clients, customers, partners, etc. You should definitely promote your site if:\n- your product is in demand among a wide audience;\n- your company has Internet competitors;\n- the goods are allowed for sale at the legislative level;\n- you are willing to wait at least a few months for results;\n- you are looking for relatively inexpensive website promotion systems that are effective and reliable in constantly attracting traffic;\n- the owner of the resource is ready to invest time and money in his site, constantly develop and improve it;\n- you plan to stay in the market in your niche or expand over time.\nTo achieve a quick effect, SEO optimization is not suitable. You will be able to see the first results after the start of work on promotion not earlier than in 2-3 months.\nSEO promotion is aimed at improving the position of the site in the search results for the selected search queries. Its goal is to increase traffic, increase the popularity of the project, and increase the number of sales and leads.\nWithout SEO optimization, your project will be lost among hundreds and thousands of other projects on the same subject. And users will never be able to find it using search engines.\nThe higher the position of the site, the more visitors you will receive. Part of the traffic will be taken by contextual advertising, but most users choose sites from the top of organic search results. Therefore, it is very important to regularly work on improving the position of the site and not stop when you reach the top. Otherwise, you may be squeezed out by competitors.\nHow profitable is SEO website promotion?\nInvesting in SEO promotion is a more profitable type of investment than ordering contextual advertising. After all, the context requires regular replenishment of the budget for significant amounts. When using SEO after entering the TOP, you can reduce the cost of promotion by doing only the regular creation of new high-quality content.\nSearch engine optimization has benefits such as:\n- low cost of attracted client;\n- lasting effect even after completion of promotional work;\n- more trust from clients, who may feel that lower quality projects need context than those that have taken first positions naturally;\n- coverage of a large audience, etc.\nSearch engine optimization and website promotion are constantly evolving. Ranking algorithms are being improved, and new analytics services and tracking the results of the work done are emerging.\nFor example, for several years, search engine optimization of a site consisted mainly in building up external link mass. Today, the main stage of SEO promotion is working on internal optimization, and for external one, donors should be carefully selected according to the principle “better less, but better”.\nSEO website promotion in search engines includes three key areas: external, internal optimization, or organic SEO and analytics. Each direction consists of different actions that must be performed in a certain sequence. SEO myths for 2023 will help you understand how to work better and what you should pay attention to.\nWhy it’s important for you to know the SEO myths and distinguish them\nAll site owners want to one day open Google, enter a couple of words, and see their resource not just on the first page of the search results, but, preferably, in the first position.\nGetting data on constantly changing search algorithms is not so easy, as a rule, the search giants notify only about a part of the changes. If advertisers are not SEO professionals, then even this limited information can easily be skipped.\nThe most annoying thing in this situation is that the myths about the CEO lead to the fact that all the efforts spent on optimizing the site will not give results. As a result, new employees are hired, money is spent, and there is no output.\nKnowing the myths about SEO is essential to an effective promotion strategy.\nHere are a few reasons why it’s important to know SEO myths:\n- Avoiding mistakes. Knowing the SEO myths for 2023 allows you to avoid mistakes associated with outdated or incorrect approaches to SEO. This helps you focus on effective methods and strategies that will help improve your site’s visibility in search results.\n- Separation of facts and fiction. SEO is constantly evolving, and many of the statements that were relevant in the past may no longer meet the current recommendations and requirements of search engines. Breaking the myths helps you navigate the latest information and make informed decisions.\n- Improve efficiency. Using the right SEO information helps optimize your website for search engines and increases its ranking in search results. You will be able to develop an effective SEO strategy that will improve your site’s visibility, drive more organic traffic, and increase conversions.\n- Adapt to change. Knowing the SEO myths for 2023 helps you be prepared for changes in search engine algorithms and your own SEO strategy.\n- Education and professional development. Tracking changes, learning new facts, and debunking myths will help you grow as an SEO professional and help you become an expert in the field.\nRemember that SEO is a complex and dynamic process. Following the right practices and updated knowledge will help you create an effective promotion strategy and succeed in improving your site’s visibility in search results. Do you want to understand how effective your SEO promotion is? Use the power of analytics to properly evaluate results.\nDebunking SEO Myths 2023\nThere are several reasons why users create and spread SEO myths for 2023. One of them is a lack of understanding of this process. SEO is a complex and multifaceted field. It requires deep knowledge and constant learning. Some people may have a limited or incorrect understanding of SEO, which can lead to the spread of myths and misinformation. It is also important to remember that search algorithms and recommendations change over time. Myths can arise from outdated information when people continue to propagate practices that were once relevant but are no longer recommended.\nIn the SEO world, there is a lot of information from different sources, and not all sources are reliable or verified. Some myths may also arise from the spread of unverified or inaccurate information based on assumptions or personal opinions.\nSEO is free traffic\nIf you still think so, forget about it. SEO customization has never been free and never can be. In order for this tool to work and organic traffic to the site, its owner must invest a lot of time, effort, technical knowledge, and modern technologies, bring his resource to the top, and only then reap the benefits of “free traffic”.\nThe costs of an SEO specialist are obvious, but besides him, the IT team indirectly deals with this issue. These are web designers, copywriters, marketers, etc., and they also need to be paid a salary.\nIt is worth considering other indicators such as the cost of entering the market and the cost of possible lost opportunities.\nYou can easily set up SEO yourself\nIf you are not an expert in this field, you cannot. Or go through the chain of training – practice – implementing SEO on your project.\nHigh-quality tuning requires a lot of experience and constant practice since the rules of the game are constantly changing and you need to keep track of them.\nThe setup of an amateur who has read a few articles about SEO and decided to try it himself will never compare to the setup of a professional. Remember about lost time and opportunities if you rely on yourself in everything.\nSEO does not work, it is better to use AdWords\nThis point often leads to the myths of SEO site optimization. Paid advertising is a great tool, but not a panacea, much less a replacement. According to statistics, only 10% of users who view ads click on them, which means only 10 people out of 100. The rest prefer organic search. Large companies care about SEO, it always brings good results.\nIf there is organic traffic, you can forget about other channels\nAnother SEO misconception. High-quality traffic from organic can only start coming after a few months of hard work, and this does not mean that there will be enough traffic for the successful operation of the business. Organic traffic needs to be constantly maintained, SEO Website optimization is a continuous process. Paid promotion, for example, through Google Adwords, are additional promotion channels, which, in turn, can have a positive effect on the SEO of the project.\nEven large companies, known in many countries, spend about 10% of their revenue monthly on paid content promotion, telling the buyer about their promotions and new products. This study was conducted by the international agency Gartner Research. Buying ads increases brand credibility. Even the Top 3 companies on the first page of a search use AdWords, not to mention those indexed on the second and subsequent pages.\nEvery website needs SEO\nOn the one hand, it may seem – yes, to anyone, but if you dig deeper, some nuances begin to emerge.\nWho is probably not suitable for this promotion channel:\n– mono brands (competition with large resources);\n– one-page sites (in 90% of cases, promotion will be impossible);\n– projects with a low budget for SEO in a competitive niche.\nPlaces in the TOP-10 can be bought\nAs much as multimillion-dollar corporations and small projects would not like it, places in the TOP-10 are not for sale. Not sold in the TOP-50 and TOP-100. If you want your site to move up the “ranking ladder” – implement SEO.\nThe site should only be in the TOP-1 or TOP-3\nBeing in the top three is, of course, good, but it can cost a tidy sum. Moreover, search engines bring their services to the first position, therefore, this is not always possible.\nImportant: If the site is reflected in the honorable 4th or 5th place, it can bring no less sales than the TOP-3. This is easily explained by the psychology of buyers who want to compare prices and assortment. The SEO strategy should be based on relevant keywords that will help users find the information, product, or service they need.\nIt is enough to advance in the TOP-10 and you can stop in SEO\nThese are also misconceptions about SEO, competitors do not stop. SEO is not a one-time adjustment, but systematic work. If today you are in the TOP-10, this does not mean at all that in a month everything will remain the same. The rules of the game change, and new market participants appear, so you won’t be able to optimize SEO once and enjoy the result.\nInexpensive SEO is possible\nA lot depends on the niche and the competition. But the concept of “low-cost SEO” will be different for every business. Everyone has their own concept of inexpensive cost and promotion price. The cost of SEO includes several blocks:\n- Filling content;\n- site audit + changes;\n- link building and etc.\nThe price tag for the services of specialists can also differ tenfold, but at the same time, the result of their work will be different. In SEO, a deep study of all the nuances is important, and budget specialists, in general, work superficially.\nYou need to create a landing page for each keyword\nThese are SEO myths! First, it will limit your content and make it keyword-poor. Secondly, this way you can create a lot of unnecessary landing pages that will not be as informative for the user as one article on one page with well-developed keywords. Thirdly, it will lead to a colossal waste of time and effort without significant output.\nDo not link to third party sites\nThe main mission of any article is to leave a satisfied and satisfied reader, and if you need to go to another resource for additional information, there is nothing criminal in this.\nThe link will be useful to the user – good, no – bad.\nCopy content – get punished\nThere has never been a penalty for copying content! Google filters out duplicate content, but this means that only one site will be displayed for a keyword. By duplicating someone else’s content, you will simply kill your SEO, but the great Google will not punish you.\nThe same filter is applied to title and description, so make sure they are unique.\nSearch engine optimization no longer works\nThere are enough examples and cases of specialists from different countries. They prove that sites with competent search engine optimization are well promoted in search engines and show positive dynamics of their development on an ongoing basis.\nAlmost all traffic goes to the first three sites in searches, the rest go crumbs\nYes, there are many such resources. But let’s not forget that sites are usually promoted by a large number of requests. In the process of analyzing key groups, it turned out that, if you look at it as a whole, then sites with TOP positions lure less than half of thematic traffic. Therefore, if the resource is in the top ten, then it will have traffic.\nContent affects SEO\nContent is very important, but this is only the beginning of SEO.\nHigh-quality content, but with “lame” mobile and image optimization will not be useful, because no one will read it because of the inconvenience. Some time ago, sheet pages were a success on the Internet. But now search engines will “prefer” content that will be useful to the user. Even if it is ten times smaller. And then, even if one of your articles hit the TOP, you should not think that it will be there forever. The information may be out of date. And the content can drastically fall down. Therefore, you need to update the material on the site constantly. At a minimum, keep it up-to-date and authentic.\nWebsite optimization for search engines consists of several stages. Most of it is done internally, but it is also important to attract traffic from external sources.\nYou can promote in search engines any site that sells goods, and services or provides useful information to users.\nBefore you start working on increasing positions in search results, you need to conduct a thorough SEO analysis of the site. Also, study your competitors and your thematic niche. Any action must go according to plan. To learn the basics of search engine optimization in more detail, it is recommended to take SEO training. Use also Artificial Intelligence – it can become your indispensable assistant in your work.\nSEO is an ongoing process as search engine algorithms are constantly changing and the competition in the market is also increasing. Optimization should be continuous and include analysis of results, updating content, and adapting to new requirements.\nWe can conclude that SEO is a long-term strategy that requires time, patience, and continuous improvement. We need to discard the SEO myths for 2023 and focus on improving the content, user experience, and technical aspects of the site in order to achieve long-term success in search engines.", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}
{"id": "1104", "text": "You can get compensation for your injuries if a car accident occurs. Although ugriz psa can seem complicated, these tips can help you get the compensation that you deserve. The first step is to contact the insurance company. You should give as much information as you can about the accident to your insurance company. In some cases, you might be eligible for higher compensation than you expected. If you don't have insurance, you can contact a different company for a higher claim amount.\nHow can I file a claim for personal injury? You may be wondering about how to obtain compensation for road traffic accident injuries. There are many aspects to consider when you submit a personal accident compensation claim. Gather as much information about your injury as possible. It is important that you keep a record about your injuries and expenses. In order to properly document the event, you may need to give a statement. If you are able to, write down the key details of the accident, including who was at fault, what the weather conditions were, and who came to help you.\nIf you can, collect the details of the accident, including the police report number. This information is essential for the legal system. A lawyer can review your case details and assist you in seeking out compensation from the responsible party. For more information about claiming compensation after a road traffic accident, read Andrew Gray's recent rant. Next, contact Rosenbaum & Rosenbaum P.C. for free legal advice. Get free legal advice\nThe next step in your road accident compensation claim is to determine who is responsible. If another driver caused the accident, the other party is responsible. This person may have been under the influence of alcohol or not be able to drive. In either case, it is crucial to prove that the responsible party is legally accountable. It is essential that the driver demonstrates they did not drive under the influence or alcohol.\nHow is compensation calculated What is pain? And how is it measured in a roadside accident claim? Emotional and physical trauma are both considered pain and suffering. Although physical injuries may not be quantified in any way, emotional trauma and pain can have a devastating impact on your life. The legal process cannot erase those pains. Pain and suffering damages are crucial in determining a car accident settlement. Here are some common examples. While some injuries from car accidents can be covered by economic damages for certain injuries, others are not.\nAnother method involves multiplying suffering and pain damages by a multiplier. This method, known as the “multiplier technique,” assigns an multiplier to the total amount incurred by the victim. According to this method, the multiplier is increased if the victim suffers more pain and suffering. This method is not perfect. However, lawyers can use varying multipliers in order to calculate the value for a compensation claim.\nThe daily damages method considers how long the victim of a road traffic accident has been suffering from his or her injuries. It is calculated based on the person's regular income and how much pain they have experienced. The concept behind daily damages is that living in pain is equivalent to a full day of work. If the accident caused pain lasting more than a single day, the victim should expect to be awarded a higher amount of compensation.\nDo I accept my first offer of compensation? The insurance company that offers you compensation is most likely the negligent party’s insurance company. They will likely pay for the costs and damages resulting from your accident. The insurance company may offer you a settlement. However, should you accept it. Insurance companies are businesses. They are only interested in making as much money as possible. Therefore, it is in your best interest to take legal advice as soon as possible.\nAlthough it is tempting to accept the initial settlement offer, it is best to take your time to review all of your options before accepting it. It's fair you get paid what it's due. However, the amount you receive will be used to pay for medical bills, lost earnings, vehicle repairs, and so forth. Some people continue to suffer pain years after the accident, which is why it is important to have a realistic expectation of what you'll receive.\nWhat are unfair claim techniques? Most states have adopted some Unfair Claims Settlement Practices Act. These acts protect customers from unfair practices by insurance companies and require them all to treat claims fairly. These acts help to ensure that insurers communicate honestly and in a timely manner with their insureds. However, laws may vary from one state or another. They all have the same goal: to stop insurance companies from engaging unfair claims practices.\nInsurance companies are motivated by lowballing injured third party compensation claims. However, this is costly and time-consuming, and many people lack the patience and financial resources to pursue these claims. Instead, insurance companies resorting to strong-arm tactics or denials to get third-party claimants to accept lower settlement offers. This tactic is not only profitable, but it also inconveniences their insureds.\nInsurance companies are prohibited to charge drivers who recently transferred their insurance policies an enhanced premium. They must consider transferees the same as if they were constantly covered. They are also prohibited from imposing a cap or limiting the insurance premiums. It is important that you are familiar with all the regulations and laws applicable to insurance companies. Insurance companies must not discriminate between insured or uninsured drivers. They could face legal action if they do.\nHow much compensation should I request? It's common to wonder how much to ask for compensation for a road traffic accident if you've been involved in one. While most car drivers are honest, some may not be reliable. Additionally, accidents can occur when the driver of another car is drunk or without insurance. Victims of such incidents may not be eligible for compensation. However, a video recording of the accident scene is helpful to protect victims from false accusations. Photos of the scene might also prove useful in a compensation claim.\nFirst, refuse to accept any offer. After a road traffic accident, insurance companies will contact victims to offer them a settlement. However, accepting the first offer closes your right to claim compensation and may leave you with anxiety. If this is true, you may have to accept more compensation. This could lead to a decrease in your health and your ability for normal functioning. Instead, consult an insurance advisor by calling 080065248881 and asking them for advice.\nIf you were hurt in a road accident, you can also ask your employer for a settlement. This is especially true if you were in the car at the time of the accident. You have the right to file an insurance claim if you are hurt on the job. It is vital that you and the other party involved in the accident seek immediate medical attention. To get treated quickly, call an ambulance immediately if you're injured in a road accident.\nWhat evidence do I need? Photos and videos can be useful evidence in proving compensation for road traffic accidents. Photographs can be used to prove the accident site, who was responsible and the extent of the damage. Videos can also prove the driver's negligence or road conditions were not as they should be. They can also show a link between the accident scene and injuries. Photos can be used as dramatic evidence in court.\nAlthough it is not admissible in court a police report can be persuasive to an adjuster. It may also include contact information for witnesses. The police report can contain valuable information about the accident, in addition to medical records. If you were injured by whiplash, a cop can testify about what he saw at the scene, and whether he issued any citations. Additionally, the black box, or event recorder, can provide valuable information about the events that occurred before and after the accident.\nYou may also benefit from the testimony of eyewitnesses to prove the accident. In proving fault and liability, eyewitnesses could also be helpful. These eyewitnesses will be able to give an objective and detailed account on what happened in the crash. You may also need to provide evidence that the property was damaged, such as from a car accident lawyer who assesses the damage.\nWhat is a lump sum settlement? A lump sum payment is a large one-time payment that an accident victim can use to pay off debt or make home improvements. It allows the victim to spend the money as they please, without worrying about inflation. Structured settlements pay the victim in a set amount over time. That way, they don't have to wait for a treatment or support equipment to arrive.\nUnderstanding the process is key when deciding whether to accept lump-sum compensation for road traffic accident victims' compensation. While lump-sum payments may seem appealing, many injuries can get worse over time. Psychological injuries, however, are more difficult to treat. It is therefore crucial to make an informed decision about whether you should choose a lump-sum or a lifetime medical benefit.\nThere are certain steps you should take to protect yourself if you accept a lumpsum settlement for road accident compensation. First, determine whether you are eligible to receive a lump sum. You should also make sure that you have sufficient income and health insurance to pay for your medical expenses. A workers' compensation lawyer is the best way to determine if a lump sum settlement will work for your case.", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

{"id": "1108", "text": "Last Thursday, I spent the day sat in something like a church pew in Court 3 of the Royal Courts of Justice. I was watching the General Medical Council take advantage of its relatively recently acquired right to appeal the result of a doctor’s fitness to practice hearing. The right of appeal was given to the GMC by an amendment to Section 40A of the Medical Act. As I watched the proceedings and the way the GMC argued the case, I wondered whether the GMC should have been given this right at all.\nSat in the public gallery, I found myself sitting next to the doctor at the centre of the case, Dr Bawa-Garba. This lady is a junior doctor who has been convicted of manslaughter for her part in the NHS’ negligent treatment of Jack Adcock, a 6 year old boy who died of sepsis at Leicester Royal Infirmary in February 2011. In amongst a catalogue of system failures and having to do the job of two doctors during a double shift, Dr Bawa-Garba failed to spot the early signs of sepsis, did not act on significantly deranged blood results and delayed starting antibiotics after wrongly making an initial diagnosis of Gastroenteritis.\nThe GMC is challenging a decision made by the Medical Tribunal Practitioners Tribunal Service, one of its own committees that it claims to have functional independence from, to reject the GMC’s call to strike Dr Bawa-Garba off the medical register. The MPTS says it is there to protect patients by making independent decisions about a doctor’s fitness to practise. The GMC claims to recognise and respect the MPTS as a specialist tribunal and accepts that it would be improper for it to bring an appeal simply to invite the court to substitute one reasonable view of a case for another.\nI have a 6 year old son and a 4 year old daughter and cannot even come close to imagining the pain that would come as a result of losing one of them, or the suffering of Jack Adcock’s family. But as I sat there next to Dr Bawa-Garba, I could see first hand, another kind of suffering that may well be just as difficult to imagine or understand. Having suffered a bit myself as a result an NHS whistleblowing case, I wanted to show my support for a colleague in a very difficult situation. I find it hard to believe that a junior doctor has found themselves having to respond to legal action brought against them in the High Court by the General Medical Council - supposedly in the public interest, to challenge a decision by the MPTS not to strike them off the medical register.\nAs a father and a doctor I have no choice but to accept that I too could find myself being on either side of a terrible NHS mistake. We have to face facts that as a society we are making choices that will make such mistakes more likely to occur. The choices that are being made in relation to the NHS only seem to be getting worse hence the recent flurry of NHS crowdfunded litigation. Underfunding the NHS, driving out dedicated staff, unaccountable leaders and regulators, coupled with the recent fracturing of whistleblowing protections are already leading us to some dangerous places. The tragic case of Dr Bawa-Garba and Jack Adcock is a powerful warning to both patients and staff about where we are heading unless we change our path.\nThe nuts and bolts of the action brought by the GMC against Dr Bawa-Garba in the High Court relate to their objection to the way the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service made their decision not to strike her off the medical register. The GMC take issue on the basis that the MPTS should not have been influenced in the way that it was by the multiple system errors at the hospital and numerous errors of others involved in Jack Adcock’s death. The GMC further stated that such information was not relevant given the manslaughter conviction and that such consideration would seek to ‘get behind’ the criminal conviction for manslaughter. In their submissions the GMC accepted that not all doctors who are convicted of gross negligence manslaughter should be struck off. It is difficult to see how the MPTS was supposed to go about deciding what category Dr Bawa-Garba would fit into without exploring the wider hospital failures or the failures of other healthcare professionals involved in the case. The GMC maintained that anything other than the erasure of Dr Bawa-Garba from the medical register would not be sufficient for the protection of the public. This emphatic GMC position is despite it being uncontested that Dr Bawa-Garba had an unblemished career and had been a good and safe doctor before and for some time after the events leading to the death of Jack Adcock. She also continued to be employed by the Trust following the tragic events and was only prosecuted 3 years subsequently when a decision not to press charges was changed by the Crown Prosecution Service.\nOne of the things that I found most perverse about the GMC position in this case is their argument that “the wholesale collapse of the standard of care provided by [Dr Barwa-Garba] came out of the blue and for no apparent reason.” This GMC argument only gets off the ground if the multiple failures at the Trust are not referred to. As Counsel for Dr Bawa-Garba summarised in the MPTS hearing;\n“The events leading to [Dr Barwa-Garba’s] conviction did not take place in isolation, but rather in combination with failings of other staff, including the nurses and consultants working in the CAU that day, and in the context of multiple systemic failures which were identified in a Trust investigation.”\nThe Judgment from the Court of Appeal refusing Dr Bawa-Garba leave to appeal her conviction set out several factors that Dr Bawa-Garba relied on in her defence of manslaughter;\n· A failure in the hospital's electronic computer system that meant that ordered blood tests were delayed and not received from the hospital laboratory in the normal way and Dr Barwa-Garba was without the assistance of a senior house officer as a consequence.\n· Dr Bawa-Garba had flagged up the increased CRP infection markers in Jack's blood to the consultant, Dr O'Riordan, together with the patient's history and treatment at the handover meeting. The consultant had overall responsibility for Jack.\n· A shortage of permanent nurses meant that agency nurses were being used more extensively.\n· The nurse involved had failed to properly to observe the patient and to communicate Jack's deterioration to Dr Barwa-Garba, particularly as Dr Bawa-Garba was heavily involved in treating other children between 12 and 3pm (including a baby that needed a lumbar puncture).\n· The nurse also turned off the oxygen saturation monitoring equipment without telling Dr Bawa-Garba, at 3 pm, when Jack was looking better.\n· The nurse did not tell Dr Bawa-Garba about Jack's high temperature 40 minutes earlier or the extensive changing of the nappies.\n· It was correct to be cautious about introducing too much fluid into the [patient] because of his heart condition\nThe Crown Court also heard that, Dr Bawa-Garba’s Consultant, Dr O’Riordan was aware before Jack died that he had a serum pH of 7.084 and a blood lactate concentration of 11.4 mmol/L, which he wrote down in his notebook at evening handover. However, he did not perform a senior review of the boy because, he said, he was not specifically asked to by Dr Bawa-Garba. He said he would have expected her to “stress” these results to him.\nFrom the High Court hearing, I heard that Dr Bawa-Garba was doing the job of two registrars on the particular day and that she was required to cover an additional unit by her employing NHS Trust.\nWhen I look at some of the arguments advanced in the Crown Court by both the defence and prosecution I cannot quite believe such arguments were part of criminal proceedings. A significant amount of them were technical points relating to the clinical assessment of shock. How has a junior doctor found themselves in the dock in criminal proceedings arguing that they were “correct to be cautious about introducing too much fluid into the [patient] because of his heart condition”? Together with the prosecution, in order to gain a conviction making points about capillary refill and high levels of lactate in the blood. It was also decided to to use Dr Bawa-Garba’s educational ePortfolio reflections against her, this will have a catastrophic effect on a future doctor’s ability to reflect openly and honestly about serious incidents and mistakes.\nThere can be no doubt that the NHS grossly failed Jack Adcock. However when looking at the arguments for both the criminal prosecution and the defence it becomes clear, to me at least, that the jury room of a Crown Court is never going to be a place where justice will be served in complex medical cases like this. This is despite the best efforts of a jury and even if there is a faultless summing up by a judge.\nIn contrast, the specialist Medical Practitioner Tribunal Service with its panels of doctors, lawyers and lay people are much better placed to explore complex cases like this, maybe even more so than the senior courts which makes the GMC’s decision to challenge the decision of the MPTS in this case all the more surprising. The GMC accepted in the High Court that it should have deference to the expertise of such a tribunal, yet this only seems to apply when it agrees with them.\nOne of the first acts of Counsel for the GMC in the High Court was to proudly inform the court that since 2016, the GMC had made use of its relatively new Section 40A right of appeal no less than 18 times and that of those 18 applications, 11 had succeeded. It was almost as if there was a belief that the GMC’s winning streak would assist in the case before the court.\nWhat I found most troubling about the GMC’s position in this case is its reluctance to accept the significance that serious system failures can have on patient safety and a doctor’s ability to offer safe care. By bringing the case against Dr Bawa-Garba, they have also sought to challenge the MPTS’s attempt to understand the wider context of these tragic circumstances. The GMC’s emphatic justification of such an approach was that it is the duty of a doctor not to put themselves in a dangerous position in relation to competence and skills, not the hospital’s duty.\nThis chimes with my experience of the GMC. In my own case they failed to act or initiate investigations into very serious, now accepted safety and staffing issues and they misled the profession on a gap in whistleblowing law that has been preventing the issues in my case being heard by a court for over 3 years. The GMC even failed to provide a response to a letter sent to it by 1,000 doctors challenging its actions in my case.\nWhen the High Court turned to considering whether or not the public interest would be served by not striking Dr Bawa-Garba off the medical register, astonishingly one of the GMC’s arguments on this was that no one could be found that could describe Dr Bawa-Garba as an exceptional doctor and the people they did speak to were only prepared to say that she was in the top third of doctors in training. A statement like this speaks volumes about the GMC’s attitude to this case and to doctors that find themselves in Dr Bawa-Garba’s position.\nThe fact that Dr Bawa-Garba is from a black and ethnic minority background is somewhat of an elephant in the room in this case. It sits uncomfortably with the GMC’s defeat in the Supreme Court last month to Dr Michalak, another doctor that the GMC chose to pick a fight with in the courts. In that case it attempted to argue that its actions in respect to Dr Michalak and all other doctors should not be subject to equality legislation in employment tribunal proceedings. This includes situations when the GMC is accused of discriminating against doctors on account of race and other protected characteristics. Dr Michalak has already won her case against the NHS and received over £4 million pounds of compensation, so it is very likely that the GMC will have some serious questions to answer about their treatment of her. Questions that the GMC has tried its best, at huge expense, to avoid having to answer.\nStatute imposes an overarching objective on the GMC to protect the public. This includes: to protect and promote the health, safety and wellbeing of the public; to promote and maintain public confidence in the medical profession and to promote and maintain proper professional standards and conduct for members of the profession.\nStriking off a doctor who has an unblemished record and who was clearly in an under-resourced and unsafe situation will set a dangerous precedent. In an NHS at breaking point, with many doctors struggling to cope with increasing workloads, this will only lead to more cover ups, more doctors leaving the profession or the country and more pressure on remaining staff. This in no way protects or promotes the health of the public, and definitely does not maintain confidence in the medical profession. It seems to me that the GMC has lost the plot with the Dr Bawa-Garba case and it is important for NHS safety and transparency that the public does not join them.\n1. Bawa-Garba v R  EWCA Crim 1841.

The full amount was sent directly through the eBay Giving Works program to the United Way of Western Connecticut, an organization at the forefront of humanitarian change.\nCongratulations to our high bidder and thank you so much for helping families in need! <3\nI can’t wait to get the winning bidder’s photo and start drawing! Stay tuned for my next Charity Art Auction next week, and thank you to all who bid and/or spread the word, for caring about those who most need our support.\nLike many people, I’ve been thinking a lot about Sandy Hook. When I first heard about the terrible shootings last month, I couldn’t really digest what was happening and my first reaction was to block it out. Tragedy always paralyzes me and what could I possibly do to help those innocent children after the fact? I avoided the newscasts and headlines, knowing they would only break my heart.\nAs the weeks passed I felt more and more disquiet. I had to do something – WE had to do something. So I spoke to my friends, fellow artists, and tried to come up with a plan, but things remained amorphous, and I didn’t want any empty gestures.\nBut last week I found out about the Sandy Hook School Support Fund, from the United Way of Western Connecticut. They are helping the survivors and the people of Newtown/Sandy Hook, by providing support services and resources as needed. From counseling to financial support, I know the families of the victims could use such services, and I was so happy there was a way I could help.\nIt’s really hard not knowing what to do to help people who are far away, whom you don’t know, and not being able to fathom how much they’ve been through. But hopefully, this little bit will contribute to the combined efforts of us all, to show our love and support.\nIf you would like to have a portrait done for yourself, of a loved one or family pet, and would like 100% of the proceeds to go to the Sandy Hook School Support Fund, please go to my live auction here ». It ends on January 29th, 2013, and more info can also be found on my Causes page.

One critical element of this is the education of our student body about the importance of giving back. The Student Trustees are tasked with reaching out to our campus and DU organizations to donate directly to the Student Foundation Fund or one of the project we are highlighting for the current academic year. The most important part of this process is educating the student body about what giving back to DU can do. By starting the tradition of giving back to DU while a student, we are able to not only help the student body immediately through donations, but ensure future support of the Institution as well. We strive to reach as many student organizations and individual students as possible.\nThe DUSF provides grants up to $500.00 to support activity’s in three areas:\n- Student support – projects will address the needs of DU students and educate students about available resources for assistance\n- Sustainability/green projects – advance environmental awareness on campus and expand DU’s focus on a sustainable future\n- Enhancing the student experience – programs or projects that celebrate and advance One DU and help to provide an inclusive and engaging environment that supports our students.\nApplications are graded on the proposed activity’s novelty, philanthropic value, impact on the University of Denver or the student community, ability to further the mission of the Student Foundation, and the perceived feasibility of the event/initiative. Higher priority is given to proposals that develop a greater understanding among people, a sense of social and professional responsibility, and qualities of leadership. Lower priority is given to proposals for standard educational requirements or programs that have been available through other channels in the past. Apply for a DUSF Grant\nWe build leaders\nThe University of Denver Student Foundation provides leadership opportunities and educational programs that emphasize developing skills in the areas of leadership, public speaking, and fundraising. The DUSF is committed to the continued development of its members and through DUSF student trustees will have opportunities to:\n- Develop general skills in the areas of fundraising, programming, event management and public speaking.\n- Practice presentation skills, including verbal communication, body language, creating buy-in, persuasiveness and physical presentation of self.\n- Learn networking skills and the value of establishing relationships within in the DU community.\nThe University of Denver Student Foundation will provide students with extraordinary opportunities to meet distinguished alumni, work with a real endowment, and become experts on educating others on the importance of philanthropy. From orientation to commencement, students will have the opportunity to see the impact of philanthropy on their educational experience.\nCurrent fundraising projects\nSupport your fellow Pioneers\nStudent Emergency Fund – The Student Emergency Fund (SEF) provides limited emergency financial assistance to currently enrolled University of Denver students who are unable to meet immediate, essential expenses because of temporary hardship related to an unexpected situation. The fund is designated to off-set a short-term financial need and is not intended to replace or supplement financial aid. Funds are awarded as a grant, and unlike a loan, do not need to be repaid.

How about providing them the ability to cultivate an outdoor worm farm, in combination of vermicomposting, if your family have time and patience for such thing.

I have fideled worms .some call it other names like grunting or rooting but this is the bomb..LOLRITF\nLooks like my larger dogs love to gain additional proteins by gobbling up all my larger earthworms in the backyard that attempted to escape the over saturated soil. My lawn is down to less than 20% of mix species. Couldn't find any more larger ones beyond 4 inches after a few quick digs at the prime spots contain high concentration of compost..Great..\nVisited a friend yesterday for the Mother's Day party, and spotted the Alabama/Georgia jumper crawling across the walk way from an over saturated soil spot. I was surely surprised to find one in this neck of the urban jungle. Surely enough, tracing back to where it came from, I spotted someone living in one of the apartment had a luscious yard, full of herbs and plants, while the surround neighbors' yards were completely barren. No wonder I found the jumper here.\nSince my jumper's population is less than 100 in the garage compost bin, time to replenish with another 1000 from Uncle Jim's Worm Farm. You guys live in the central areas and east coast are lucky to have jumpers in your soils. They are the best for soil aeration, and one awesome fishing bait. You guys should harvest them, and cultivate them to make some cash flow on the side. They are nature's gold when it comes to panfishing.\nI will have to try this, my Father in Law has plenty of walnut trees on his property, considering we can cross the creek. might try the battery thing, but with a 9v instead of 12v since I dont have easy access to a 12v....\nRemember, go easy with the black walnut solution mix. It's not only poisonous to worms and fish, ingest a nice concentration enough, it will also bring you down.\nAs for the battery, check your 9V to see if you have sufficient amperage to get the worms up. If your 9V battery cannot shove out 3AHr load, you're not going to get them out of the ground. Just make sure to protect yourself. 1A current going up from your legs/arms and through your heart is more than enough to kill you.\nI just raise my own worms in my basement. two rubbermaid containers, a little peatmoss, and 100 european crawlers. in 6 months you will have thousands of worms, in a year so many you will never run out. i have not bought bait for 4 years and the bin is still going strong.\nI used to read a lot of books from Herters back in the 60's like ,\"Professional Guide secrets\" or some such. They said to mix soapy water with dish soap in a fairly strong solution, and do the same as with the walnuts. I think it's the acid that irritates them to come up, and you have to rinse them the same as with walnuts. Thanks for posting this! I bet you could store dried walnut hulls and use them even when the nuts weren't on the trees yet too!\nThat's a good idea!

{"id": "1119", "text": "The River Severn River, Full Bladders & The Bridge BetweenSaturday, October 15, 2011\n|Lauren Elizabeth Stewart & Acer griseum\nChristopher Chabris reviews three books about the brain in this Sunday’s NY Times Book Review, Brain Bugs – How the Brain’s Flaws Shape Our Lives by Dean Buonomano, Now You See It – How The Brain Science of Attention Will Transform the Way Live, Work, and Learn by Cathy N. Davidson and The Compass of Pleasure –How Our Brains Make Fatty Foods, Orgasm, Exercise, Marijuana, Generosity, Vodka, Learning, and Gambling Feel So Good by David J. Linden. This is what caught my eye and ultimately led me to the River Severn and the Severn River.\nWhat is new, however is Buonomano’s focus on the mechanism of memory, especially its “associative architecture,” as the main causes of the brain’s bugs. “The human brains stores factual knowledge about the world in a relational manner,” he explains. “That is, an item stored in relation to other items, and its meaning is derived from the items to which it is associated.”\nThis is an old idea that is well illustrated by word association experiments, in which “river” leads to “bank,” which activates “money,” and so on. But a much newer body of research suggests that this “priming” can spread not just from word to word but from one kind of information, a puzzle, say, to an entirely different domain, such as social interaction, as long as the same concept in invoked in both. Buonomano describes a famous experiment by the psychologist John Bargh and colleagues in which subjects who unscrambled lists of words that listed sentences of politeness, like “They usually encourage her,” were later more polite toward a lab assistant than were subjects who generated sentences related to rudeness. Other researchers have reported that subjects with full bladders exercised more self-control in a completely unrelated realm (financial decisions) than subjects who had been permitted to relieve themselves first – a finding that earned them this year’s Ig Nobel Prize in medicine, award annually to unusual or ridiculous-seeming scientific research.\nThe short of it is that I have always felt that our very human ability to associate disparate events, things, people and words is what truly makes us human.\nOne of the students in my photography class at Focal Point is a young lady called Severn. I told her I found the name most unusual to which she replied, “It is a river in England, the River Severn and one in Ontario the Severn River.” I left it at that not knowing that the Severn would come up soon in this ever human endeavour we call association.\nWe were informed over the weekend that we had to assist Lauren with her homework project. It was about arches and she had to bring a short précis with a picture of an arch and read it in class.\nRosemary asked me to help and the first thing I did was to avoid the obvious associations of arches in Paris or very Roman triumphant arches. I thought that Roman aqueducts might be the right route. But then I had another idea. Back in the 80s I had walked over the iron bridge which spans the River Severn at the Ironbridge Gorge, by the village of Ironbridge, in Shropshire, England. It was the first arch bridge in the world to be made out of cast iron, a material which was previously far too expensive to use for large structures. However, a new blast furnace nearby lowered the cost and so encouraged local engineers and architects to solve a long-standing problem of a crossing over the river.\nThis then became Lauren’s arch project and I am sure that hers will be the only one that features a bridge, a bridge with an arch. But the association to my student Severn and the coincidence in such few days is not all there is more.\nIn 1709, an ironmaster in Coalbrookdale, Abraham Darby I, succeeded in producing cast iron using coal. He discovered a process whereby coal was first turned into coke. When coal is turned into coke most of the sulphur is lost as sulphurous gases. The coke could then be used in the smelting process to produce iron. Darby kept his discovery a secret and passed it on only to the next generation of Darbyies. His son, Abraham Darby II, and his grandson, Abraham Darby III, eventually perfected his method.\nIt was Abraham Darby III who built Ironbridge, it opened in 1781, and from then on iron tracks and more bridges crisscrossed England and brought fruit the Industrial Age.\nOne of my most favourite English Roses in my garden is the English Rose, Rosa ‘Abraham Darby’. It is a rose that Lauren knows well as the flowers are large, of brilliant peach colour and with a scent that is fruity and most powerful. The rose grows well. In fact it is an almost aggressive climber. My guess is that Shropshire rose grower, David Austin has named this rose after the builder of the Ironbridge.\n|Rosa 'Abraham Darby'\nNueva Rosita, Coke & Abraham Darby Three Times", "scores": {"score": 3, "score_transform_1": 5, "score_transform_2": 5, "score_transform_3": 0}}

Where are all the French?\n|Third Turn and the French Infantry are all gone!\nGame 2The scenario was that the French (Matt) had to raid the town and as such I gave them an extra point in their force compared to Tim. Thus 4 French to 3 British. Matt decided to take a cannon this time to try out the cannon optional rules. (So he claimed)!\n|Initial set up\nGame 3.With 1 victory a piece Tim was now the attacker. His mission was to gather livestock. Matt took another cannon (he seems to like them) and a couple of line infantry squads. Tim had only grenadiers and line infantry. (No Indians or cavalry this time on either side)\n|Matt's cannon has trouble getting in arc of fire. but infantry from both sides open fire.\nThe random event cards did bring on a brief downpour and musketry was halted for the\n|Tim rolls better dice and our first morale check of the day.\nMatt's infantry are forced to pull back. Well the Two of them still alive\nin that unit!\n|The British finally are in position to bring fire on the cannon.\nThe cannon does get to fire back,\nbut realistically too little and far to late.\nAnother British victory.\nGame 4.Matt refereed and I got a game against Tim's British. A straight forward encounter battle. Tim took cavalry for the first time as well as Indians. As it was my first try I kept it simple with just 1 cavalry and the rest line infantry.\n|Tim looses his cavalry to my line infantry on the right. He then sets about\npicking off my centre. Only fair as I wipe out his Indians as well.\n|My cavalry don't get a chance to move so I detach the character. And then my centre infantry\nare totally destroyed now leaving my officer exposed!\nBut with Tim's flanks both gone (the Indians and Cavalry)\nI am able to bring my infantry to bear on his centre.\nHe soon looses sufficient troops to fall below 50% starting figures and therefore looses the game.\nThe Last game (game 5) I forgot to take any pictures as I was up against it from the start. Tim took charge and I lost horribly to Matt. (You rotter Matt!). The game consisted of Matt firing his cannon and wiping out my Grenadiers in two turns before they got in range to shoot back. Drat. So that was my right wing dangling in the wind. An event card stole my left flank unit as it was needed elsewhere. So I only had my centre left and was aware that a single casualty would put me over 50% casualties so I tried t get some cover. It kind of worked as another event banished Matts cavalry from the field of play and I was lucky enough to bring fire unanswered on Matt's centre. But eventually matt killed one of my figures and I was forced to concede.\nOverall a very good day. 5 games 3 French victories, 2 British victories and on a personal level I won 1 and lost 1 so not too bad. Could be a lot worse.\nThe best part though is it looks like Tim will get a small force as well. Given that it was two army forces it's a little hard to draw definitive conclusions on the rules. Yes we got a few things wrong but when don't we? But I will continue to build these forces up some more and maybe start a town militia or outlaw band.\nThanks for reading today maybe another quick post tomorrow as well. All the best Cheers Clint", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

He makes his very French love of fine food seem like the most natural, healthy, and appropriate response to the exquisite array of foods available, from the most simple of fresh salads, to the most decadent of desserts.\nReviewed by Magdalena Ball\nWeekend on a Plate\nBy Gabriel Gaté\nPublished by Allen & Unwin\nOctober, 2001, AUD $35.00\nGabriel Gaté is an Australian celebrity. His boyish good looks, and gallic style have appeared for 20 years on a range of television cookery shows, and his 14 cookbooks have all been bestsellers. He is a food writer for a range of lifestyle magazines and newspapers, and has regular radio spots. His food is known for its fusion of French and Asian influences, its emphasis on fresh, high quality ingredients, and its simplicity and family appeal. Weekend on a Plate was originally published in 1999 as a hardcover with the title Indulgences. Its recent reissue in paperback form, with a new title is part of Gaté’s celebration of the sale of over 1 million copies of his cookbooks. Weekend on a Plate is a nice looking cookbook, in large (good for gift giving) format, with evocative pictures by noted food photographer John Hay. The book is broken up into chapters based on the sequence of a day, from breakfasts and brunches to lunches and barbecues, dinner parties, treats for two, family favourites, sweet endings, and a chapter on cooking basics such as pastries, stocks, sauces, and custards.\nGaté has a very delicate prose style, which is both casual and sophisticated, evoking clean white tableclothes, fresh coffee, crusty breads, quality wines, and herb rich meat dishes prepared with care. He makes his very French love of fine food seem like the most natural, healthy, and appropriate response to the exquisite array of foods available, from the most simple of fresh salads, to the most decadent of desserts. As an old New Yorker and morning person, I love fancy breakfasts much more than fancy dinners, and Gaté’s breakfast chapter is one of my favourites in the book, including some delicious, simple, but still classy and fancy dishes like the gruyere and chive souffle, masala omelette, spicy compote, french eggs en cocotte, tortilla, and potato pancakes, along with a range of fresh fruit juices. For lunch (or light dinners), there are fast risottos, pizzas, and a nice selection of fish and meat dishes, including my favourites rainbow trout with a lemon and caper salsa, and mediterranean barbecued quail. Dinner includes richer baked meats such as the roast pheasant in pastry, baked quail with honey and ginger, boeuf a la ficelle, and a range of polentas, gratins, grilled vegetables, and salads.\nThe Treats for Two section emphasises foods of very fine quality like truffles, preserved lemons, crayfish, smoked salmon and oysters, but all of recipes are relatively easy, and fast to put together, and all of them contain healthy vitamin rich ingredients. Family favourites like minestrone or vegetable soups, beef casseroles, and chicken dishes are all hearty, simple fare. The desserts are rich ones, like the heavenly, and hedonistic chocolate dacquoise with its layers of meringue, chocolate, and hazelnuts, or the chocolate crème caramel, the inventive frozen cappucino souffle, or the range of luscious home made ice creams. Gaté’s philosophy is that everyone deserves to indulge themselves with simple, beautiful food, and the personal health and well being he radiates, along with those of his equally attractive wife and children are a testimony to the benefits of this approach to good eating. While the recipes in Weekend on a Plate are generally not original, relying more on a lighter, more modern, slightly Asianised versions of French and Italian classics, but the book is nonetheless inspiring in its handsome layout, and in the selection of recipes which are both easy, and appealing.", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

She has officially diagnosed herself with creative ADD and often has a million and one writing projects going at once. In addition to writing, she is also a graphic artist who enjoys creating custom book covers for indie authors. She is definitely an artist at heart and would love nothing more than to be elbow deep in clay during her waking hours.\nRene believes that all fiction is based on some form of reality—otherwise we would never have the inspiration or knowledge to dream up the realistic situations we portray with our words. She is proud to say that her personal experiences have been inspirational, though perhaps not always identical to that of her fictional characters. Where reality and fantasy diverge, however, must remain her little secret...\nCherime MacFarlane Although born in New Orleans, I am proud to call myself an Alaskan. I have lived here since 1977. I have seen -40 degrees, hauled water, made bear bacon and I live in a cabin. I have used a fishwheel to catch salmon coming up the Copper River. I was my second husband's chief mechanic's helper and roadie. I have cut firewood on shares. I worked as a cocktail waitress during pipeline days in a small lodge on the Richardson Highway.\nMy second husband, a Scot from Glasgow, was the love of my life. When I write Scots dialect, I personally experienced hearing it from my in laws. When my husband got on the phone to Scotland, after 5 seconds I could barely understand a word. We moved to Wasilla to get warm. It barely drops past -25 degrees here in the winter. I became a paralegal and worked for over 26 years for the same firm.\nAlaska is my home. I never thought I would love it so much, I never want to leave. The beauty of Alaska is a draw I cannot resist. I love the people and the history. I have been captured by a place I came to under duress. Life does play some interesting tricks on one. My love and I were not apart more than 24 hours for 20 plus years. I never wanted to be anywhere but with him. He was a man to run the river with and was my biggest fan.\nRebekkah Ford grew up in a family that dealt with the paranormal world. Her parents Charlie and Geri Wilhelm were the directors of the UFO Investigator's League in Fairfield, Ohio. They also investigated ghost hauntings and Bigfoot sightings in addition to extraterrestrial cases. Growing up in this type of environment and having the passion for writing stories is what drove Rebekkah at an early age to write tales dealing with the paranormal world. Her fascination with the unknown is what led her to write the Beyond the Eyes trilogy and Tangled Roots.\nRebekkah resides in rural North Dakota, in a farming community of about 1,800 and loves where she lives. She has an irreverent sense of humor, adores coffee, and yummy food makes her happy. She loves books, history, antiques, animals, connecting with her fans and other authors, and watching her favorite TV shows.\nTraci Hayden My love for books began at a very small age. I lived inside the many worlds the local library could provide. The characters within those pages were my companions and my support when I needed someone most.\nMy imagination began to soar as I grew. I began writing small poems as a teenager, but never thought much about publishing or expanding beyond put my words to paper.\nAfter my children were born, our love for a certain TV show fueled my love for writing. Using my children as inspiration, I began to write fanfiction, my children being the characters within the stories.\nMy passion for putting words to paper (or screen as is the norm now) has turned from passion to obsession. I’ve made some incredible friends through this journey and in turn, have become not only an author but a promoter and supporter for those whose imagination dreams character and worlds that I can lose myself in.\nI thank my precious children, my beautiful soul-mate and my forever sister and best friend for being my constant rock and support as I continue to walk this road called life.\nFor Kendra Hale, who has lived in Canada, the USA and on the European Continent, Great Britain, or the UK, will always be home. Her love for the UK is apparent in The Snow Crystals, and her other/future books, which are all set here. Kendra’s knowledge and life-long interest in the world of antiques, collectibles and such, finds its way into her writing. She writes fiction in different genres.\nMichele E. Gwynn is an Amazon Bestselling Multigenre Author of Crime/Detective books, Sci-Fi/Horror books, and Paranormal/Supernatural books in San Antonio. She previously wrote for newspapers, magazines, and online websites like Examiner.com (under the categories of Film, Animal Rights, and Sex and Relationships), Alwayz Therro Magazine, FashionErotica Digital, and more. As a journalist, she's covered news and events, and conducted countless celebrity interviews.\nShe has three series currently with several stand-alones, and more books coming! As if that weren't enough, she has published adult short stories under the pen name Xaviera Snow.\nShe resides in the small town of Schertz, Texas on the northeast side of San Antonio with her four felines who so graciously allow her to reside in their home.\nHolly Barbo's world is shaped by her love of her family, the beauty of the natural world in Northwest Washington State and an irrepressible creative drive.\nLiving where the scenery is incredible with a rich abundance of wildlife \"is so special and soothing that it feels like a quiet kind of magic,\" according to Barbo. She is drawn to creating stories where there is just a bit of something unworldly, perhaps it is magic or psychic skills. Her stories are mostly in non-urban settings and usually have some focus on nature, building a discordant drama inside the peaceful frame.\nSusan Griscom writes paranormal and contemporary romance. She's hooked on sexy romances and is a huge fan of superheroes and bad boys confronted with extraordinary forces of nature, powers, and abilities beyond the norm mixed with steamy romance, of course.\nShe loves those days when she gets to sit around in her sweat pants, doing nothing but writing emotionally charged stories about love and violence.\nShe lives in Northern California in wine country and one of her favorite weekend excursions is wine tasting with the love of her life. Together, she and her romantic husband have five great superhero kids and eight mini-superhero grand kids, so far.\nLynda Kaye Frazier spends her days working for a group of Cardiologists doing ultrasounds, then each evening she’s in front of her computer, working on her next story. She grew up in Pennsylvania, but now lives in Arkansas where she enjoys the four seasons without a long, cold winter. She’s an avid reader of romantic suspense, which is the genre that she writes. Other than spending time with her family, her favorite things to do are writing, reading, listening to music, and—her most favorite—going to the beach. Surf, sand and a good book-her stress relief.\nK. S. Haigwood is the author of the Save My Soul, Eternal Island and Moonrising series. By day, she is a CNC Machinist, but by night and weekend, she saves the world or destroys it in a single bound, depending on what mood she is in and if she has had her coffee. In addition to being an award winner for the 'Life Changing Read Award', she has also been nominated twice for Best Indie Book 2016 in the Paranormal category.\nCharacterization is one of K.S. Haigwood’s strongest points. You can understand each characters' predicaments and you can almost foresee their reactions. But. There’s always a but, with this author, because Haigwood can deliver enough twists and turns to turn a tornado on its head. Just as you think you’ve figured where the story is going next, she’s duped you again.\nThe whole of her novels are littered with good chuckle moments, and even in the darkest hour, the thinnest hint of a silver lining is still visible among the clouds.\nShock therapy for body and soul, delivered at a hundred miles an hour with the humor and charisma of a trendsetter, Haigwood is certain to be hailed the new wonder-drug to cure all ills.\nElla Medler is a U.K. author and editor. She writes fiction in many genres in a seemingly vain attempt to slow down her overactive brain enough to write non-fiction on subjects she knows a thing or two about. She also does not believe in the starchy use of English and ignores the type of rule that doesn’t allow for a sentence to be finished in a preposition. Her books are action-driven, and well-developed characters are her forte. Loves: freedom.

{"id": "1133", "text": "Web Operations: Are you developing an asset or a liability?\n“Buy vs. Build”. It’s a term you hear repeatedly with it comes to businesses weighing their options for application and systems management solutions. But as anyone who spends time in the web operations trenches knows, the reality is always something closer to “build vs. build”. Buy something from a software vendor, use open source tools, develop something from scratch – in each situation there just isn’t a one size fits all option and there is always going to be custom integration involved. This reality was previously covered in Alex’s “Stone Axes” post.\nSo being resigned to the fact that there is a “build” aspect to any solution, the next critical choice then becomes what guidelines you impose on your organization to steer their design choices. The most pervasive design criteria seems to be technical completeness or elegance. From a technical architect’s purist point of view this makes sense; but what this often fails to take into account is the business impact of those technical decisions.\nWhile many technical design options might seem to have identical business impact on day 1 (they cost roughly x to develop and provide feature y), what are the true cost of those decisions down the road? Have those decisions put the company in a position to continuously leverage those design choices into increasingly greater returns? Or have those decisions placed an anchor around the company’s neck that they will be weighted down by, and paying for, well into the future? To put it into loose economic terms: have you developed an asset or a liability for your company?\nWhat would be an example of building asset? Using off the shelf open source tools and only developing thin layers of integration where they need to plug into your existing systems.\nWhat would be an example of building a liability? Writing a custom system that mirrors the available functionality of existing off the shelf tools, thereby saddling your company with the sole responsibility for the forward progress of the design and maintenance of that tooling.\nThe asset vs. liability concept is one that obviously needs to be flushed out quite a bit more. In any case, it’s shocking how infrequently companies actually analyze the long-term business impact of the technical design decisions made about their tooling.\n(Note: Thanks to Lee Thompson for framing this as an asset vs liability debate)", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

{"id": "1137", "text": "Organisation and Operation of our Garden\nThe Earl’s Court Square Garden is one of the 37 Garden Squares in the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea administered under the provisions of The Kensington Improvement Act 1851 (The 1851 Act).\nMuch of the information in this section has been taken from the RBKC website including legal guidance from Cripps Pemberton Greenish for Garden Committees.\nThose people who have the right to use the garden enclosure (although the Garden Committee may by resolution allow others to use it).\nThe Garden Committee\n• Garden Committee members are those liable to pay the Garden Charge with their Council Tax for any dwelling facing the garden and who have been resident for at least a year.\n• The Garden Committee is exclusively responsible for the care, management and regulation of the garden. Neither the Council nor any freeholder of the garden has any role under the Act.\nThe Garden Sub-committee\n• The Garden Committee can appoint a Sub-committee to manage the Garden on a day-to-day basis, as is the case with Earl's Court Square Garden.\n• The Sub-committee must consist of between three to nine Garden Charge-payers. Scroll down to see who we are.\nMEETINGS, AGM & EGM\n• Any five members of the Sub-committee may call a full meeting of the Garden Committee. Extraordinary General Meetings may be called either by five members of the Garden Committee or by the Garden Committee Secretary.\n• Notices of the meeting must be posted on both gates of the garden at least seven days in advance of the meeting. In practise the Sub-committee also email notification of meetings to Committee members who have provided their email addresses.\n• The Garden Committee members elect a Chair for each meeting. The Chair has a casting vote in the event of a tie.\n• At least three members are required to form a quorum, and these members can be from either the Committee or the Sub-committee.\n• The Garden Committee must hold an Annual General Meeting once each year. This meeting must approve the Garden Charge for the following year, and elect the Subcommittee. (The AGM is generally held in January and the date published on this site.)\n• The Treasurer’s Report to the AGM details all expenditure incurred during a financial year running from 1 December to 30 November.\n• The Garden Charge money (precept) is restricted by the 1851 Act to use for the maintenance and improvement of the garden including keeping it \"enclosed, laid out, fenced, planted, gravelled, maintained, repaired and embellished\". It would appear that the intention was therefore to be wide ranging to cover all expenses normally incurred in the maintenance of a garden at that time, and applied to contemporary conditions thus is taken to include e.g. lighting equipment and electricity, key access systems, seating etc.\n• Income received from Garden Subscribers (residents of Earls Court Square granted discretionary access to the garden who are not Garden Charge-payers) is unrestricted by statute and thus enables money to be spent occasionally on items such as musicians on garden open days which otherwise may fall outside the scope of the 1851 Act.\n• The annual budget is presented at the AGM as part of the Garden Charge proposal which is then presented to the council for approval. RBKC collect the appropriate charge from Garden Charge-payers alongside their council tax before passing the funds back to the Committee.\n• Major expenditures such as tree pruning, maintenance of the paths, lighting, irrigation, the play area, etc are outlined at the AGM. Reserves are accrued over several years to even out wide swings in expenditure and maintain a predictable level of Garden Charge.\n• We believe that the Earl’s Court Square Garden represents excellent value for the residents. You can find the Council’s Garden Expenditure League Tables here. Look at the column headed Garden Charge Band D and you will see that Earl’s Court Square has one of the lowest per household garden levies in the entire Borough.\n• Garden Committee members, acting through their Sub-committee, are able to make byelaws for the proper management of the garden under their care.\n• Our garden byelaws, having had the Court’s approval, are enforceable. This means that a breach of the byelaws may be prosecuted in the criminal courts, resulting in a court conviction, criminal record and a fine.\nRelationship to the Earl’s Court Square Residents’ Association\nThere are two residents’ committees that are intimately concerned with the affairs of Earl’s Court Square. This website describes the Earl’s Court Square Garden Committee. There is also the Earl’s Court Square Residents’ Association (ESCRA) which encompasses the entire Earl’s Court Square Conservation Area and deals with all local affairs aside from the Garden. The two Committees work closely together, but it is important for residents to know what their respective responsibilities are.\nECSRA's Mission Statement highlights:\n- preserving the square's architectural integrity\n- easing traffic and parking problems\n- the enhancement of residential amenities\n- providing social events for residents of the square", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

He studied landscape painting in Valenciennes, and travelled to Switzerland, Italy and the Ottoman Empire. He made a very short tour of Ottoman territories, principally of Southern Greece and the islands (Zakynthos, Cythera, the Peloponnese and Hydra) as well as Istanbul and the Hellespont. At the end of the 18th century, during the reign of Sultan Selim III, in an effort to ameliorate relations with the Ottoman empire, France organized an expedition to Istanbul with the mission to repair ships and aid in other tasks in the port of the city. Castellan participated in the mission as a painter.\nThe expedition was unable to realize its goals, as its members were forced to flee in the face of war, an epidemic, fires and a revolt. Castellan however published his impressions of this voyage, in a text written in epistolary fashion, which circulated in three editions, with numerous engravings based on his drawings. Unluckily, Castellan’s work circulated at the same time when Pouqueville knew huge editorial success with his own books. Castellan became a member of the Acadèmie des Beaux Arts, to which he dedicated the last years of his life. His work “Moeurs, usages, costumes des Othomans” (1812) was lavishly praised by Lord Byron.\nIntelligent and objective as well as sensitive, Castellan depicts the islands, the Peloponnese and Propontis, focusing on each place’s traditions. He is one of the first travellers to become sensitive to Greek music and Greek Orthodox religious art. Harmonious with his text, the French traveller’s drawings accompany his gentle discourse. Free from prejudice, Castellan describes the new world he sees before him: fortresses, cities, mosques, churches, fountains, houses, mills, antiquities and people.\nCastellan started out from Marseilles in December 1796. By way of Sicily, the ship reached Cythera first, then Monemvasia and finally Hydra.

We used this approach as an introduction to the hands-on activities that were programmed for afterwards and were targeting students. Using a format of an online (Zoom platform) Symposium with moderated discussion offered us to engage and expand our audience. We invited national and international experts to participate in the talks on the future of fashion materials - more precisely we had a discussion and presentations on the topic of Innovative biomaterials. Combining practitioners and researchers from different fields of biobased materials, we created a broad circle of expertise in a limited time.\nTarget audience and context of use\nThe event was intended for students, teachers, scientists and other experts interested in biomaterials. Symposium was used as an intro to the later Cellulosic and Biomaterials hands-on workshops for students.

Ordinarily, that wouldnt be such a good thing. But, in this case its not a bad thing at all. The half dozen eggs weren’t those you would find on a farm or your local grocery store. These are Tenga Eggs. Six individually wrapped little devils, each with their own texture and a handy package of lube.\nTenga does a great job of making male masturbation toys and they don’t disappoint with this product. So lets start with a description of the Tenga Egg.\nAs I mentioned, each egg comes individually packaged in – you guessed it – a plastic egg, similar to what the Easter Bunny would bring you. But of course, these are not edible. You peel off the protective wrapping and crack open the egg. Inside you will find a very soft and stretchy egg. Inserted into each egg is a small pack of lube, which is good for 1 to 2 uses, depending on how much lube you prefer. Just like most male toys, lots of lubricant is recommended. The egg is hollow with a rather small hole, in which you stick your dick. Each egg has its own unique feel to it, with different raised features to stimulate either the penis head, the shaft of the penis or both as you stroke your member up and down inside the egg.\nTenga Egg Spider – lined with vertical and horizontal lines to form a spider web\nTenga Egg Wavy – the raised lines wrap around horizontally\nTenga Egg Stepper – raised spheres line the surface\nTenga Egg Clicker – notched out with semi-circles\nTenga Egg Silky – features a thread-spun surface\nTenga Egg Twister – similar to the Wavy, with the lines going vertically\nNow, Mother Nature has blessed me – so when I first cracked one of these open, I thought ‘no way is my dick going to fit into that hole comfortably’. However, I was pleasantly and pleasurably surprised. These toys are very stretchy and most likely handle any member. Unless of course, you are John Holmes. Lube is the key.\nNot only was I able to get my dick inside, I was able to stroke to completion with each of them. One of the cool features is that as your stretch the egg down your shaft, you can see your dick inside. This is nice if you want to admire your rock-hard friend while you pleasure yourself. It kinda turns me on.\nThese eggs were designed & marketed for single use, but, I have found that if you clean them with some warm water, turn them inside out to dry and then store them back in the plastic containers, you can multiple uses out of them.

Furthermore PARP inhibitors change mitochondrial flaws in principal myotubes of obese human beings and attenuate hereditary flaws of mitochondrial fat burning capacity in individual fibroblasts and boosts NAD+ availability and SIRT1 activity in tissue such as for example skeletal muscles and dark brown adipose tissues (Bai et al. 2011 As a result mitochondrial oxidative capability is improved in muscles of expression is certainly adversely correlated with energy expenses in mouse hereditary reference populations. Finally we demonstrate how genetic and acquired mitochondrial defects could be improved simply by Paribs. Therefore our function pieces the stage for the feasible clinical usage of Paribs in circumstances of faulty mitochondrial function. Outcomes AND Debate Characterization of Paribs in C2C12 myotubes We originally likened how different Paribs BSI-201 PJ-34 ABT-888 AZD-2881 and MRL-45696 could recovery NAD+ drop upon H2O2-induced PARP-1 activation in differentiated mammalian cell lines such as for example C2C12 myotubes. MRL-45696 a dual PARP-1 and PARP-2 inhibitor produced from niraparib (Chinnaiyan et al. 2012 Jones et al. 2009 many effectively rescued the H2O2-induced NAD+ drop with a minimal AG-L-59687 nanomolar IC50 (Supplemental Desk 1). MRL-45696 decreased the redox potential in C2C12 myotubes at concentrations only 1-10nM (Body S1A) and elevated mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) (Body S1B) and O2 intake prices (OCR) at 10nM (Body S1C). To Gpc4 certify that the consequences of MRL-45696 derive from PARP inhibition we also utilized another Parib AZD-2281 (Olaparib). In contract nanomolar concentrations of AZD-2281 reduced redox potential while raising MMP and OCR (Statistics S1E-S1G). Notably MRL-45696 or AZD-2281 weren’t dangerous at these concentrations as ATP articles was unaffected (Statistics S1D and S1H). Chronic PARP inhibition enhances energy expenses and SIRT1 activity As flaws in mitochondrial fat burning capacity certainly are a hallmark for most illnesses Paribs could in process also be utilized for these non-oncological signs. Such use could possibly be overshadowed by many concerns however. Initial chronic Parib treatment AG-L-59687 could induce genomic instability (Curtin and Szabo 2013 Second Paribs wouldn’t normally just have an effect on PARP-1 but also PARP-2 as well as the combined reduced amount of both actions could be harmful for long-term viability (Menissier de Murcia et al. 2003 we characterized the influence of long-term MRL-45696 treatment in AG-L-59687 mice Hence. We initially driven that eating admixture attained higher MRL-45696 amounts in plasma and muscles than dental gavage (Statistics S2A and S2B) therefore choosing this path for further research. We next given HFD admixed with MRL-45696 (50 mg/kg/time) to 10-wk previous male C57BL/6J mice. MRL-45696 blunted HFD-induced bodyweight gain (Amount 1A) because of reduced fat deposition (Amount 1B) and was connected with higher energy expenses (Amount 1C) without impacting activity or diet (Statistics 1D and 1E). Although PARP-1 provides been proven to influence genome balance and cell viability no proof for toxicity on genomic DNA or mobile damage was discovered as liver organ 8-oxo-dG and muscles lipid peroxidation amounts were similar between your groups (Statistics 1F and 1G). That is based on the reality that and was also elevated in Parib treated muscle tissues (Amount S3K) which signifies that a lately identified SIRT1-reliant pathway (Gomes et al. 2013 where NAD+ handles metabolic wellness may be in play also. Therefore SIRT1 appears key towards the activities of Paribs on muscles fat burning capacity. MRL-45696 enhances mitochondrial proteins translation and sets off the UPRmt Paribs boost mitochondrial respiratory capability in worms by triggering the mitochondrial unfolded proteins response (UPRmt-) within a SIRT1-reliant AG-L-59687 way (Mouchiroud et al. 2013 Nevertheless the feasible translation of the selecting into mammals is not explored.

{"id": "1154", "text": "A forest is more than trees. We often have a hard time looking past the gold mine of timber products that are available in forests. The very word ‘forestry’ has come to imply large-scale removal of forested areas on which the economies of numerous communities have been built. Improved technology and increased demand have provided us with the ability and motivation to continue harvesting this resource at exponential rates. While quite profitable, short term gains are often the norm and once thriving forestry communities find themselves starving for employment (for another resource example think of the Cod Fisheries in Eastern Canada).\nAs sustainable development becomes more engrained into our thinking and the way we operate, the forestry industry has fortunately adapted (although perhaps not to the scale that is yet required). Selective logging, impact assessments, consideration of biodiversity and non-timber forest products often play into the decision making process.\nBhutan is such a country that has recognized the value of intact forests and the ecosystem services they provide (carbon sinks, erosion prevention, water retention, species habitat, air purification, recreation). Estimates range from 60-80% of original forest coverage that remains in Bhutan, which is a staggering percentage! As a result, many non-timber resources are thriving in Bhutan, such as mushrooms.\nThe other day I had the opportunity to take a walk in my backyard, just south of the Royal Thimphu College campus. What quickly became apparent is that there was an abundance of mushroom species with different sizes, shapes, and colors. On my return a quick Internet search revealed that in fact Bhutan is quite renowned for its mushroom industry and there is even a Bhutan National Mushroom Center (will be visiting soon), which grows and conducts research on various species. Foragers have found mushrooms quite profitable and a way to supplement/boost their agricultural income. However, mushroom harvesting also comes with a number of threats. Health concerns are widely recognized as many poisonous mushrooms exist leading to local fatalities each year. As a result the government has initiated education campaigns to inform about such dangers and to help with mushroom recognition.\nEnvironmentally speaking, overharvesting has also become a problem. As with any resource, there exists an ability to ‘bounce back’, or a resilience. If mushrooms are allowed to grow to a proper size and develop their intricate mycelium root system, future yields will continue to be prosperous. However, harvesting has become competitive, leading to early harvesting and decreasing the resilience of various species. So it seems that, like other resource industries, mushrooms are in danger of the human tendency to overexploit for these short-term economic gains.

{"id": "1157", "text": "How to go upwind on your kiteboard\nIf you can't do it, you spend a lot of your day walking up the beach. Commonly known as \"The Walk Of Shame\".\nAt my local surfsport, I spend the day doing triangles. I surf downwind a kilometer or two, then need to work back upwind in two tacks to get back and do it all again!\nFor me, the trick has always been things like looing upwind. Sounds trivial, but makes a huge difference - fix your sight on where you're heading, and it's a pretty good start. Twist your body, so your whole posture is about going upwind. You also need to be reasonably powered up, so that you can drive it through your feet to grind the board upwind. The speed also helps your board keep traction in the water. If you're hitting swells, you might bend your knees to absorb them, so you don't lose all your speed.\nI do'nt think that looking where you want to go is the key... it may help, but it's really your foot work and edging that makes you go one way or the other. I can go upwind by looking backwards... what i found made a HUGE impact when learning upwind, is:\n1 - twist your back foot slightly backards - oposite direction of travel - this will help put more pressure and edge on the back of the board... kind of like if you are doing twist dance...\n2 - keep your front leg straight - that's a proper stance - unless you wanna be called a pooman... although this is just a general remark, the first point is what will help with upwind\n3 - it's likely that a type of kite you have may be further making it harder... when i used to do landboarding, i had a kite that just couldn't get me going upwind...\ndjdojo collected comments from previous topics:\nAny modern board that's the right size and not absolutely wake-dedicated is fine (the custom is not helping due to lots of rocker and 132 is small for that style of board, but you should be able to get it unless you're 100kg). upwind, as with light wind, is all about technique. of course dedicated boards will go better in the right hands/feet, but my experience is that a small gain in technique will yield more satisfying results than dropping a grand on a new toy. here are some tips. (i raced boats and sailboards for many years before kiting so there's some sailing lingo in here.)\nA really light touch on the bar and a delicate balance between front and rear foot pressure will let you respond quickly to slight changes in wind speed and direction.\nIf you hit a lift (wind shifts so you can point higher) let the bar out a fraction and edge just a little harder to steer upwind further.\nIf you hit a knock/header (wind shifts so you can't point as high) flatten out your board to maintain speed as you bear just as far downwind as you need to keep the kite powered up.\nIn a gust let the bar out a bit to let the kite fly further forwards and load up your back heel a bit more to point a little higher.\nIn a lull shift some load to your front foot and flatten the board a bit to maintain speed. if you need to pull the bar in briefly to keep the kite powered as you adjust course, be prepared to let it out again quickly to prevent stalling.\nLook upwind. your head leads a twist through your torso and this helps keep things loaded up automatically to point high.\nAgain, a delicate and responsive sensitivity to shifts in wind speed and direction and water conditions (bend knees over chop to keep up your speed and edge and not bounce downwind) lets you take full advantage of the conditions to find the sweet balance of speed and angle.\nI did say slightly bent, not tucked right up. No pooman stance. I use this technique and it gets me upwind, also easier on the legs. I do agree with you that it isn't the correct stance and only do it when I want to get upwind quick, such as on shore wind. But does work imo\nHayman chipped in:\nUse your trim strap by pulling it in a couple of inches which will sheet the kite out, making it fly further around to the edge of the wind window; thus increasing the angle of attack upwind.\nkeep ya kite low, which will help you hold a solid edge to drive upwind.\nfly with one hand once ya got your speed up, this will rotate ya hips around, pointing the nose of the board upwind more.\nThe majority of the power should be coming through ya front lines into ya harness. There should be barely any tension in ya steering lines once youve got your speed up. If there is alot of tension in ya steering lines, its means ya got the bar to close to you, which is choking the kite and resulting in you going downwind..\nOne thing which I was told that REALLY helped was don't try too hard to go upwind, if you try to lean too much/point too high, you will just slide out and go downwind.\nMake sure you are pushing your weight through your heel in your back foot while pulling up (towards your head) with the toes of your front foot. It was stated earlier that you should straighten your front leg, it should be pretty much straight, but NEVER lock your knee, that's how I torn my Medial Miniscus Not fun. Keep your front leg only slightly bent and squat more onto your back leg ensuring that you are leaning back against the pull of the kite and slightly twist your body upwind.\nGetting the right angle of lean and remembering the feet at the same time is the key\nI think the description for snowboarding may help to explain what some are hinting at, when you look somewhere up wind your shoulders rotate, which then rotate your hips which will turn you into the wind. another way to emphasise this is to point to and look where they want to go, which is how beginners are told to initiate a turn in snow boarding (again rotating the body through the hips)\nA couple of video's popped up:\nWhere to kitesurf in Western Australia (official)\nWAKSA (West Aus Kitesurfing Association) list of kiting areas\nHow to ride toeside\nAn important skill to get sorted as soon as you've got the basics of kitesurfing mastered.", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

{"id": "1160", "text": "1 Sam 15:28\nSaul lost the kingdom and it was given to one better than he—to David.\nThis transition from Saul to David typically represents a major shift currently occurring in the church. It is not so much which group we are in, but rather what is in us—the heart of Saul or of David.\nLet’s take a brief look at the characteristics of Saul-leadership in the church.\nFirst, it is characterised by pragmatism. Samuel gave him a command to wait in Gilgal seven days: “Go down ahead of me to Gilgal. I will surely come down to you to sacrifice … but you must wait seven days until I come to tell you what you are to do.” (1 Sam 10:8 NIV). He was to wait for revelation and direction from the prophet. Just as Jesus commanded the disciples to stay in Jerusalem and “wait for the promise of the Father” (Acts 1:4), the Holy Spirit, Saul had to wait in Gilgal. But a crisis intervened, and Saul was faced with a decision: was he to obey and wait for the Lord or switch into management mode; was he going to operate out of principle or pragmatism—the spirit or the flesh? The Philistines had gathered for war with “3,000 chariots, 6,000 charioteers and soldiers as numerous as the sand”—there situation was critical (1 Sam 13:5-6). Saul waited the seven days stipulated by Samuel—but no prophet! Saul’s men began to scatter—he had to do something! To hold them he decided to offer the sacrifice himself: “Now he waited seven days, according to the appointed time set by Samuel, but Samuel did not come to Gilgal; and the people were scattering from him. So Saul said, `Bring to me the burnt offering and the peace offerings.’ And he offered the burnt offering” (1 Sam 13:8-9). He opted for pragmatism: for what would work and give immediate results, but at the cost of a principle—the principle of waiting for the Lord. He was not called or anointed as a priest but as a king. Every call and gift has limitations. He stepped beyond his calling, out of his anointing into that of another. Once we step outside the limits of our call and giftedness we step into the flesh—into soul-life and human strength. Many leaders go beyond their anointing doing things they’re not called to do which may even be good. Saul only offered a sacrifice! Surely that was okay? Apparently not.\nSense knowledge & human reason\nSecond, Saul-leadership is characterised by sense knowledge and human reason:\nJust as he finished … Samuel arrived (v 10), asking, “‘What have you done?’ … Saul replied, `When I saw that the men were scattering, and that you did not come at the set time, and that the Philistines were assembling … I thought, `Now the Philistines will come down … and I have not sort the Lord’s favour.’ So I felt compelled to offer the burnt offering.\n1 Samuel 13:11-12 NIV (author’s emphasis)\nSaul made two fatal mistakes: he saw and he thought. He operated out of sense knowledge (what he saw) and by reason (what he thought). We either walk by sight or by faith; that is, by revelation.\nThe prophet’s verdict was immediate:\nYou acted foolishly … You have not kept the command the Lord your God gave you; if you had, he would have established your kingdom over Israel for all time. But now your kingdom will not endure; the Lord has sought out a man after his own heart and appointed him leader of his people …\n1 Samuel 13:13-14 NIV\nSaul’s instantaneous response was to leave Gilgal and count his men (v 15). Completely phased by what his eyes saw and oblivious to what the prophet said, he could only look to the force of numbers: to his own resources; to human power to win the battle.\nGod is longsuffering and slow to anger. He came the second time to Saul to give him another opportunity to change principles—to operate out of the spirit rather than the flesh. Samuel came to him with another assignment: “Now go, attack the Amelekites and totally destroy everything that belongs to them. Do not spare them; put to death men and women, children and infants, cattle and sheep, camels and donkeys” (1 Sam 15:3 NIV).\nSo Saul attacked the Amelekites; but on his own terms:\nBut Saul and the army spared Agag and the best of the sheep and cattle … everything that was good. … Then the word of the Lord came to Samuel: `I am grieved that I have made Saul king, because he has turned away from me and has not carried out my instructions.’ Samuel was troubled, and he cried out to the Lord all night. Early in the morning Samuel got up and went to meet Saul …\n1 Samuel 15:9-11 NIV\nSamuel’s imminent confrontation with Saul is about to expose the hidden condition of his heart.\nThird, Saul-leadership builds a self-image. Samuel was told that Saul has gone to Carmel where “he had set up a monument in his own honour” (v 12). Believing he won a great victory over the Amelekites he built his own monument! He is preoccupied with his own image and reputation. Even when confronted by Samuel, he was more conscious of how he appeared before men than where he stood before God. He was more concerned for his dignity than his deliverance when he cried, “‘I have sinned. But please honour me before the elders of my people and before Israel … ” (v 30). The genuineness of his repentance is also compromised by the fact that it followed on the heels of the pronouncement that he had lost the kingdom.\nA spirit of religious deception\nFourth, it is marked by a spirit of religious deception. Saul greets Samuel with these high sounding words: “‘The Lord bless you! I have carried out the Lord’s instructions'” (v 13). He’s quick with spiritual sounding words to maintain his image. But it is empty talk, only smoke and mirrors. The truth is that in blatant disobedience to his assignment he kept the best of the sheep and spared Agag (see v 3, 9). Even after the prophet rehearsed the facts of his failure and disobedience (v 18-19) Saul still claimed his complete innocence: “‘But I did obey the Lord … I went on the mission the Lord assigned me. I completely destroyed the Amelekites and brought back Agag their king'” (v 20). Saul-leadership operates in denial and cannot receive truth against itself. It in fact comes out of a lying spirit. This leads to the next characteristic.\nFifth, Saul-leadership blame-shifts: “The soldiers took sheep and cattle from the plunder … “ (v 21, see also v15). Unable to receive truth against themselves Saul-leaders look for scapegoats—a fall guy. They cannot accept responsibility or admit they were wrong. Adam, confronted with his blatant rebellion against God’s revealed will, did likewise, blaming both the woman—and God: “’The woman whom you gave … ‘” (Gen 3:12a). This then leads into the next failure.\nRationalises and self-justifies\nSixth, Saul-leadership rationalises and self-justifies. He justifies his and the soldier’s behaviour by claiming it was for the Lord, which hearkens back to the spirit of religious deception previously mentioned. They fell on the plunder and kept ” … the best of what was devoted to God, in order to sacrifice them to the Lord … ” (v 21b, also v 15b). A religious stronghold is established in his life through rationalising and self-justification. When we justify our behaviour we not only neutralise the justifying work of God in Christ, but also become our own god and our own saviour. In effect, we operate in an anti-Christ spirit. Even though we may claim a religious experience, engage in public worship, give to the church and go to the prayer meeting, if at a heart-mind level we justify our attitudes, mindsets, or behaviours we are not of the spirit of Christ. Our mental arguments and rationalisations set themselves up against the true knowledge of God and we are left with merely an imitation of spirituality (2 Cor 10:5, 6, 18).\nLastly, Saul-leadership comes out of unbroken self-life. Samuel’s response penetrates to the heart of the stronghold of religion:\n‘Does the Lord delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices as much in obeying the voice of the Lord? To obey is better than sacrifice, and to heed is better than the fat of rams. For rebellion is like the sin of divination, and arrogance like the evil of idolatry. … ‘\nv 22-23 NIV (author’s emphasis)\nAt the heart of the spirit of religion, behind the veneer of high-sounding words and images of spirituality, we find at work the spirit of hell itself in rebellion and arrogance (stubbornness, NKJV). Rebellion, according to the prophet, is like witchcraft or divination. Both are connected to the worship of idols and demons. Rebellion is a satanic principle operating to one end—deification of self. Just as Satan set himself up in opposition to God coveting the worship and obeisance of all creation so too autonomous man. Animated by this satanic principle man, through self-will and stubbornness, engages in the idolatry of self and becomes a god. To attain this status and the power of a god religious man not only exerts his will in resistance of the true God, but unwittingly crosses a line into the occult so as to gain mastery and control over others. What begins in self-will ends in the demonic. Witchcraft and idolatry are, according to Paul, both “works of the flesh” (Gal 6:20). Unbroken soul-life, as in the case of Saul, eventually gives ground to demonic control and oppression. As a consequence of Saul’s covert rebellion the Spirit of the Lord lifted from him and instead an evil spirit was sent to harass him, driving him to jealousy and the attempted murder of David (1 Sam 16:14-16, 23; 18:10). The anointing had already shifted to David and, in time, so too would the kingdom.\nMay the Lord make the application in our own lives as we pray like David:\nSearch me, O God, and know my heart; Try me and know my anxious thoughts; And see if there be any hurtful way in me, And lead me in the everlasting way.\nPsalm 139:23-24 NASB\nPrint-friendly pdf: Saul Leadership", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}

After the whippings were reported, Dorsey was fired, but shortly thereafter, was allowed to accept a 25-day suspension and resume coaching , according to court documents.\nJPS interim Superintendent Jayne Sargent has said through a district spokesperson that she will not comment because of employee confidentiality rights.\nDorsey, along with other Murrah and district officials, is a defendant in a federal civil rights lawsuit filed on behalf of three players who say they were whipped by the coach for missing plays in practice. Dorsey admitted to whipping the players but said it was because of disciplinary problems, according to court records.\nOne of the players, now in college, said he was whipped about 15 times in one day.\nThe plaintiffs also allege Dorsey was verbally abusive, calling players names like “sissy,” “wimp” and “soft.” In the deposition, he admits calling players “soft.”\nIn the deposition, Dorsey admits to cursing in front of the student athletes but denies calling any a “b—-” as is alleged in the lawsuit.\nAccording to the deposition, he said, “I never used that language or recall using that language toward a player.”\nOne of the plaintiffs testified he was late for school one morning because lingering pain from a previous whipping made it difficult for him to get dressed, get in and out of the tub and sit down for the drive to school. He said he began to suffer from low self-esteem and lost weight because he had stopped eating.\nThat young man also testified he was first whipped Oct. 19, 2010, for missing a layup.

In a line of questioning, Ross asked him about whipping players for cursing when he had used profanity toward them. “Only thing is nobody hit you, right?” she asked.\n“Yes,” Dorsey answered.\nWhen Ross asked who hit him, Dorsey responded, “the Lord.”\nThe controversy involving Dorsey caused division among parents and the players last season.\nBut “an overwhelming majority of the parents want to see Dorsey remain as head coach,” Wade said Wednesday.\n“We respect his decision to step down and to not be a distraction to the kids or the program,” said Gary Love, who heads the team booster club and is a supporter of Dorsey.\n“We do truly want him to stay on as our coach,” Love said.\nCheryl Maberry, whose son plays basketball for Murrah, said he never had problems with Dorsey.\n“He always made sure that their grades came first,” Maberry said.\n“I had a nephew who played at Lanier for coach (Thomas) Billups and he was way tougher on them,” she said. “But that’s their way of getting the players to play up to their potential.

Part nature, part human endeavor, a garden has been intimately connected with poetry, painting, architecture and music. It mirrored philosophical, political, social, and aesthetic ideas of its time. And It is from these perspectives that we'll look at gardens in different cultures and times tracing their interconnectedness, mutual influence and aesthetic shifts.\nWe'll see how both Roman and Islamic garden tradition influenced the development of gardens in Medieval Europe; how the Renaissance gardens of Italy inspired the Classical formal gardens of France and Russia; and how the Dutch Baroque garden design has influenced both. We will see how a shift to Romanticism prompted a radical change to landscape gardening in Britain and how the blend of Taoism, Confucianism and Buddhism informed the design and aesthetics of the art of gardening in ancient China and Japan.\nPart of the fun of this journey will be deciphering the symbols and metaphors whose meaning is lost to a contemporary garden visitor: for example, why a fountain, or a small rose garden, was always placed in the centre of a Medieval garden and not on the side? Why was Versailles designed as a network of axial pathways leading off to the horizon? And what about a living \"ornamental hermit\" installed in the English Gardens of the 18th century? What was the meaning of the stones that the Chinese scholars have been eagerly collecting for centuries proudly putting them on display on their desks and in their gardens? And finally, who were the people who created or owned gardens and how did they spend their time in them?\nThere are disruptions, yet a wonderful continuity in every culture and my hope is that walking through the gardens of our city, connecting the past with the present, we'll be able to see the familiar with a more informed and delighted eye.\nThe course will use a lot of visual materials: photographs, reproductions of paintings as well as films (to be watched at home).\n6 Wednesdays; March 3 to April 7; 5 pm - 6pm\nDevil in Their Midst: Bulgakov and his Master and Margarita\n\"Manuscripts Don't Burn.\" M.

Master and Margarita, never seen by its author in print, proved to be a masterpiece of modern Russian letters. At once a thriller, a love story, and a book of great philosophical depth, it is also a bitter satire of the society that has claimed to have created a perfect new order, magnifying instead the ills of the past: greed, envy, fear, conceit, selfishness. It takes a supernatural force -- Satin and his retinue -- to restore morality and justice in this new Kafkaesque society. The history of the book’s creation, no less dramatic than the adventures of its characters, will give us some insights into the times it was written.\nBulgakov, Master and Margarita (any edition)\nJanuary - February, 2021, offered through SFU, Liberal Studies\nPetrarch and His World\nPetrarch is mostly known to the 21st century readers for the sonnets celebrating his long and hopeless fidelity to Laura, a married woman and an ancestor of Marquiz de Sade. But what makes this father of Humanism, and celebrated scholar of antiquity so appealing to us today is his modern sensibilities. Thousands of letters that he has left for posterity witness to his inner struggles: a devout Christian, a cleric singing Platonic love has fathered two children from a woman (women?) whose name he took care of concealing. A tireless traveler, a mountain climber, a man of insatiable intellectual curiosity, he sought solitude and a life of a hermit; yet he counted Popes, diplomats, and aristocrats among his numerous friends and acquaintances. Condemning vanity as a vice, he craved for fame and went out of his way to receive the laurel of Poet Laureate in Rome. We will study poems and extraordinary, soul-searching letters reflecting the doubts of the man, many consider a precursor of Existentialism.\nMay - June, 2021\nThe Bolshoi: Grandeur, Glory and Tribulations\nThe national symbol of Russia, the showcase of its power, the Bolshoi is one of the most celebrated ballet and opera companies in the world. Our focus this time will be the Bolshoi's ballet, 250 dancers strong.\nThe Bolshoi's claim to fame is associated with the 20th century, when Moscow once again became the capital of the country. The Bolshoi came to prominence especially after the death of Lenin who issued a recommendation to \"put all theatres into a coffin.\" The Bolshoi owes its survival and blossoming to an unlikely protector, namely...Stalin, a lover of ballet and opera. Since Stalin's time, the Bolshoi's fortunes have been inextricably linked to power: Stalin, Brezhnev and Krushev personally supervised the repertoire, appointed the directors and ordered the greatest ballet dancers to relocate from Leningrad's Kirov's ballet company to the Bolshoi in Moscow. The situation has not changed now: it's Putin who appoints (or fires) the leadership of the Bolshoi.\nWe will showcase two greatest dancers whose destinies were shaped by their unmatched talent, resistance to power and courage: prima ballerina assoluta Maya Plisetskaya of the Soviet era, and the principal dancer of the Bolshoi Nicholas Tzeskaridze of the Post-Soviet era, now the director of Vaganova Dance Academy in St. Petersburg. We will see what kind of training young talents have to undergo in order to be accepted into the company. We'll have a chance to watch and discuss famous Ballet Productions, both classical and contemporary. Excerpts from various ballets can be watched together on Zoom, while the links to the whole productions will be available for home viewing.\n3 sessions, dates to be announced\nYoung Nabokov in Europe\nNo amount of biographical detail - Nabokov's aristocratic origin; his million worth inheritance annulled by Lenin's Revolution, or subsequent penniless peregrinations on two continents - can explain his wizardry in two languages. Yet, during his life time, he had both ardent devotees and vehement detractors. (Swedish Academy blocked his nomination for the Nobel Prize four times). In these six sessions, we will focus on early Nabokov's work, less known to the North-American audience, when a writer, then in his 20 and 30, an exile in a pre-war Berlin, created in Russian dozens of superb short stories, several novels and volumes of poetry. Close analysis of Nabokov's text will reward any lover of literary art.\nOctober 2021, offered through SFU, Liberal Studies\nSoviet and Russian Cinema\nDespite (or because of) revolutions, wars, and severe censorship, Russia has produced some of the world's most original and powerful cinematography: comedy, drama, literary adaptations (Kozintzev's Hamlet got international acclaim). We will choose several major films from different periods of Russian film history: from the daring experimental twenties to the unforgettable 60s to our times.\nScreening at home, discussion in class.\n7 sessions, one hour each.\nFictional Double, A Split Self\n\"My inner self was a house divided against itself.\" St. Augustine\nPerhaps the single most interesting phenomenon, explored by writers, film makers and psychoanalysts is the ancient belief in a “double,” or “doppelgänger,” (‘double walker’) who often takes a form of a second -- usually sinister--identity of the main character, a kind of an evil twin, separated and allowed to act independently.\nIn folklore, the “double” is described as \"dark angel\" that leaves no reflection in the mirror and is associated with a disaster, death, even murder. Initially popularized by German writers of the Romantic period (Hoffman, The Devils Elixir; The Double), ever since then, writers of various cultural traditions keep using fictional double to explore the duality of human nature: the conflict between the conscious and the unconscious, the struggle between good and evil within one soul.\n4 sessions, one hour each\nMasters of Russian Short Fiction: Chekhov and Bunin\nAnton Chekhov and Ivan Bunin, two contemporaries and, in a way, rivals, enjoy now an equally high reputation in Russia. The last of the great ‘gentry’ writers regarded as the rightful successor to Tolstoy, Bunin wrote with great poignancy and economy of literary means about the fragility of life and love, the themes that became a familiar preoccupation for the modernist writers of the 20th century. We will read Chekhov's best-known short prose (including The Lady with a Dog, Ward Number 6, The Kiss, and others), as well as Bunin's great short stories about love.\n4 sessions, one hour each.\nA Journey into Medieval Russian Art\nThe ancient art of Russian icon painting speaks to us in a powerful yet enigmatic and mostly forgotten language. In this brief course we’ll discuss the complicated symbolism and lost meanings of this art; its origins, its technique, its various schools. Brought to Russia from Byzantium, and flourishing in middle ages, the ancient art was rediscovered in the late 19 the century in the most unexpected, detective-style manner. The striking beauty and conceptual depth of its images seemed so radical to the Russian avant-garde that they began to imitate it. A rebirth of icon painting is in evidence in contemporary Russia. Our journey will be accompanied by the demonstrations of the best samples of Russian icons.\n4 sessions, one hour each.\nThe Miracle and the Mystery of Human Language\nWe use language as our major tool of communication all our lives. Yet we don't know where language came from; nor how we have learned it. To master another language with a native speaker's proficiency is all but impossible after a certain age - even with the best of teachers. Yet, nobody teaches babies how to talk. Does our mother tongue shape our thinking in any significant way? Do the Chinese conceptualize time differently from the English because Mandarin doesn't have future tense, for example?\nAre some languages more complex than others? Do languages have the same number of worlds? Is it possible to reconstruct a proto-language? How do linguists go about it? We know languages die (all North American indigenous languages are endangered). But are new languages still come into existence? And why have artificially created languages like Esperanto (with deliberately simplified grammar) never worked as lingua franca, whereas English, with its 16 tense forms, has?\nThese are just a few of the mysteries to explore.\n4 sessions, one hour each.\nBetween Hell and Heaven: Russian Literature under Communism\nOn the Edge of Empires: The Ancient Cultures of Armenia ans Georgia\nThe Forgotten Splendor of Turgenev's Art\nThe Art of Short Story Reading\nOne of the most dangerous professions in the Soviet period of Russian history proved to be that of writer. The Soviet dictatorship that claimed 60 million innocent lives physically exterminated authors together with their books. Why, under such circumstances, didn't most writers stop writing? What drove them, often knowingly, to sacrifice their own lives and the lives of their families?\nAs we search for an answer, we'll look at the social, political and cultural contexts of the Stalin's times examining the works and destinies of such diverse writers as Evgeni Zamyatin, Anna Akhmatova, Boris Pasternak, Isaak Babel, Osip Mandelstam and Michail Bulgakov.\nLocated at the crossroads of western Asia and Eastern Europe, former republics of the USSR, and now independent states, Armenia and Georgia are among the oldest civilizations in the world, with a recorded history of about 3,500 years. The earliest in Europe to convert to Christianity, and to translate the Bible into vernacular languages, both countries endured struggle with Byzantines, Arabs, Turks, the Persian and Russian empires and the Soviet totalitarianism. Yet, both countries have preserved powerful national identities, wonderful visual arts, music dance and literature.\nThis course is followed by a field trip to Armenia and Georgia.\nWhether you took the course or not, you're welcome to join our spirited, curious, knowledgeable world-trotters.\nWe will drive along meandering mountainous roads with breathtaking sites in order to reach ancient churches and active monasteries in both countries. We'll visit art Museums as the Museum of Genocide in Yerevan, the capital of Armenia; will will admire mountain Ararat from Yerevan (if anybody notices the Noah's ark on top, at least take a picture). But we'll also taste exquisite Armenian and Georgian wines that both countries claim were the first to invent 8,000 years ago. It is an exciting time to be in Armenia after the recent peaceful protests have led to a more democratic government, as well as to see changes in Georgia where a first woman President has been recently elected.\nAmong the highest elevations of 19th-century Russian Literature, Ivan Turgenev (1818 -1883) stands as one of the tallest peaks next to his famous contemporaries like Tolstoy and Dostoevsky. An advocate of European enlightenment for his country, a liberal who rejected the radicalism taking root in Russian society, Turgenev aroused fierce polemics with his novels. His life long devotion to the French opera singer Pauline Viardot has inspired some of the most beautiful passages on love in literature, at the same time fueling the anger of his detractors. We'll examine Turgenev's major works in the historical and social context of their time.\nShort fiction, a relatively new art form, developed at the end of the 19th century, is a difficult genre that allows a writer only a small space to recreate the fullness and wonder of life. What makes a story tick? What means does the author use to elicit our laughter or tears? We'll gain some insights by reading such diverse writers from different parts of the world as Camus, Mavis Gallant, Dino Buzzati, Maupassant, Bachmanns and others.\nGreat Cities in Their Time: St. Petersburg and Its Culture The Art of Translation A Daring Eye Behind the Camera: Russian Women Film Directors Aesthetics of Love: A History Anna Karenina and her Creator Chekhov and Bunin Dostoyevsky the Visionary From Cicero to Sacks: Sages on Aging Genius of the Place At The Highest Point Of Artistry: Nabokov And Bunin, Russian Writers In Exile Petrarch and His World: The Story of \"The Father of Humanism\" Picturing the Holy: The Russian Icon Through the Ages: Understanding Russian Icon Russia's Arts on Film Russian Cinema In Search for Meaning: Existentialism Women In Russian Culture How To Read Nabokov In Search Of Objects And Words Lost: Writing About The Intangible Understanding Russian Civilization Soviet Cinema: Wars, Revolution and Propaganda The Making of a Dictator: Putin’s Rise to Power\nCopyright © 2023 Marina Sonkina.

{"id": "1169", "text": "An increasing number of premium bicycle companies have thrown their hat in the budget-minded electric bike ring lately, resulting in lower prices than ever before from major bike shop brands. So what’s behind this move?\nSeveral of the recent launches from major bicycle brands have included models that undercut their average e-bike prices by several thousand dollars.\nWhile Cannondale has grabbed headlines for its roughly $5,000 Cargowagen electric cargo bike recently, who remembers the much more affordable $1,900 Cannondale Compact Neo urban e-bike? The inclusion of a simpler hub motor compared to pricier and more complicated mid-drive motors helped the company reach its lowest price point yet for an e-bike.\nTrek’s electric bikes normally carry hefty price tags as well, but the company’s Dual Sport+ and FX+ also saw hub motors and lower-shelf components bring the prices down to around $2,400 at launch.\nBudget e-bikes leading sales\nOne of the reasons for this focus on more entry-level bikes is quite likely a mere numbers game. While profit margins aren’t as high on lower-priced e-bikes, they sell in much higher numbers in the US. Compared to Europeans that often buy e-bikes as car replacement vehicles and thus are prepared to spend many thousands of dollars for a higher end model, a much larger percentage Americans e-bike riders use their bikes either to supplement car trips or purely for sport/recreation.\nSure, there are plenty of Americans replacing traditional car ownership with e-bikes, and many of them will spend a bit more. But by and large, companies that serve the $1,000 to $2,000 price range in the e-bike market seem to make up the lion’s share of the sales.\nThat’s a difficult price point for many of the higher-end brands to reach, but several have gotten close. The Ponto Go! electric moped-style bike, launched by Trek subsidiary Electra, rolled out at $2,699 and offered a higher-end moped-style ride than much of the competition. It also had one more advantage going for it: access to Trek’s wide network of local bike shops offering service and support. The bike can’t compete watt for watt against entrenched favorites like the similarly styled Rad Power Bikes RadRunner, but it also comes with the backing of a much older and well-established bike company with hundreds of local bike shops to call on.\nAdditionally, a growing number of e-bike incentive programs are helping people buy electric bikes that they couldn’t previously afford, as well as helping others afford a higher-quality and longer-lasting bike than could have been possible without subsidies or tax credits.\nLower-cost e-bikes serve as introductions to higher-end brands\nWhen Specialized launched its Globe line, it did so with a calculated decision to reach value shoppers and introduce them to a higher end e-bike company.\nSimilarly to other brands that have taken a razor to their price tags, Specialized skipped the mid-drive motor and higher-end components when it rolled out its short tail and then long-tail cargo e-bikes designed for budget-minded bike shoppers. But it kept much of its higher quality design and fabrication as well as access to its network of bike shops for service and support.\nAnd in doing so, the company has started getting riders on Specialized e-bikes that likely never would have considered the brand. The Globe Hault ST launched at around $2,700, which is still a few hundred dollars more than value-priced short-tail cargo bike offerings from budget e-bike companies, but it brought the backing of a major bicycle company with it. There are horror stories of trying to get repairs done from mail order e-bike companies (though there are likely more success stories that we simply don’t hear about). On the other hand, taking a bike into a local bike shop for service is usually easy and painless.\nThus, in the process of developing a more entry-level sub-brand, Specialized has started reaching a much wider audience than it ever could have hoped to before.\nA shift toward e-bikes is good for high-end brands\nLow-cost electric bike companies are still critical for the growing US market, helping hesitant riders get their foot in the door without risking several months of pay.\nBut as US e-bike ridership continues to grow, more people are shifting a higher percentage of their transportation onto e-bikes.\nThe US market has long lagged behind Europe, but it has followed a similar trajectory, albeit several years later. Many US cities are currently working on improving their cycling infrastructure with better protected bike lanes, making cycling a more common option. Those that tend to ride their e-bikes for more miles throughout the week often gravitate to higher-priced models that require less maintenance and repair, as well as those that offer more options for local service and support when necessary.\nLower-cost e-bikes from budget companies will always be important. In fact, most of my e-bikes are from budget brands. The nicest e-bike I’ve ever bought was around $3,000, and I bought it already used to avoid paying even that much. But as nicer e-bikes grow their numbers in the US, the higher-end bike shop brands have shown that they’re ready to meet consumers in the middle with entry-level models that split the difference by thoughtful compromise on price and performance.\nFTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links.

Loans in which borrowers were 60 days or more past due declined for the fifth consecutive quarter and TransUnion predicts that delinquencies are expected remain flat or slow in their decline despite the continuing decline in housing prices.\n“Decreasing home prices can be risky because they exert upward pressure on mortgage delinquency rates. The fact that mortgage delinquency continues to decline despite this situation demonstrates that today’s borrowers are less risky,” said Tim Martin, group vice president of the U.S. Housing Market in TransUnion’s financial services business unit. “While many homeowners still face pressure to make ends meet, they have lived in their homes for a long time and have diligently been paying their mortgage each month. These are borrowers that have roots in their residential neighborhoods and may already have substantial equity invested.”\nTransUnion also reported that its 90-day Real Estate Inquiry Index dropped to its second lowest value of 26.04 in the first quarter of 2011. The index was created in 2000 and measures the demand for real estate credit.\n“Until consumer confidence improves, and housing prices stabilize, demand for real estate credit will continue to remain sluggish,” said Martin.\nThe mortgage delinquency rate decreased 3.4 percent in the first quarter of 2011 in comparison to the fourth quarter of 2010 and is down almost 8.6 percent from the year before and as a sign of growing improvement, sixty-eight percent of metropolitan statistical areas (MSA) in the U.S. experienced a decline in mortgage delinquency rates in the first quarter compared to only 44 percent last quarter.\nThe states with the highest mortgage delinquency rates in the first quarter were Florida (14.37%) and Nevada (14.19%), while the states with the lowest mortgage delinquency rates were North Dakota (1.54 %) and South Dakota (2.53%).\nTags: TransUnion, mortgage delinquency rate, housing price decline, real estate credit, consumer confidence", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

three decades later, another chief minister of punjab, beant singh, died when his car was blown up by khalistani separatists. rajiv gandhi died a brutal death when an ltte suicide bomber pulled the trigger of her explosives-packed belt. last year benazir bhutto was shot dead on the same spot where liaquat ali khan was assassinated on october 16, 1951. politics is a violent affair in this part of the world. but gandhi's assassination was different. not only were his killers hindu, they killed a man who had by then come to be regarded at home and abroad as an \"apostle of peace\" and symbolised the unique doctrine of 'non-violence'. in those early days of freedom, it was unthinkable that anybody would dare raise a finger, leave alone a gun, at gandhi. yet nathuram vinayak godse did the unthinkable, with more than a little help from narayan apte, vishnu karkare, gopal godse, madanlal pahwa and digambar badge. the historic trial that followed - it was held in delhi's red fort -- captured the imagination of the nation, unleashing sympathy and hate for the conspirators in equal measure. barring badge, who was either openly spat upon or secretly reviled for turning approver -- turncoats may win reprieve from the state, but they are looked down upon by all. the first book of any substance on gandhi's assassination was stanley wolpert's nine hours to rama, published in 1962 and promptly banned by the government of india; the ban still remains in place, although you can order a copy from amazon.com. it's largely an anodyne version of the killing that shocked the entire world, but wolpert's suggestion that perhaps those responsible for gandhi's protection failed in their task riled -- and continues to rile -- government. nine hours to rama was made into an eponymous film by mark robson in 1963; dvd versions of the film are also available at amazon.com. the first book of any substance on gandhi's assassination was stanley wolpert's nine hours to rama, published in 1962 and promptly banned by the government of india;

dvd versions of the film are also available at amazon.com. manohar malgonkar's book, the men who killed gandhi, a gripping recreation of india's partition, independence and gandhi's assassination on january 31, 1948, was first published during mrs gandhi's emergency when manuscripts were cleared by censors who merrily ran their blue pencil through text which probably they could not even comprehend. \"this made it incumbent upon me to omit certain vital facts,\" malgonkar writes in the introduction to a new and lavishly illustrated edition of the book published by roli, \"such as, for instance, dr bhimrao ambedkar's secret assurance to mr lb bhopatkar, that his client, mr vd savarkar, had been implicated as a murder suspect on the flimsiest ground.\" the excised portions find their rightful place in the new edition, as do rare photographs and documents from the national archives. nathuram godse, apte and their accomplices look remarkably relaxed during the trial, unconcerned about the possibility of being sentenced to death - eventually godse and apte were hanged; karkare, gopal godse, pahwa were sentenced to life imprisonment. they never regretted their deed. those were terrible days. hindu and sikh refugees from pakistan were struggling to keep body and soul together. many of them had lost their loved ones in the partition riots -- women were raped in front of their husbands and children; young girls were abducted; men were disembowelled; trains arrived laden with dead bodies; people fleeing marauders were set upon with ferocious brutality. madanlal pahwa, a young refugee, malgonkar writes, \"reached a place called fazilka, in indian territory, and discovered that another refugee column in which his father and other relatives had set out, had fared much worse. they had been attacked by muslim mobs: 'only 40 or 50 had survived out of 400 or 500...'.\" delhi was flooded by nearly one million refugees, all of them desperately looking for food and shelter. they were distraught and traumatised, unable to figure out why their lives had been turned upside down in so gruesome a manner. nor could they understand the rationale behind protecting delhi's muslims. what left them aghast was gandhi's insistence that hindu and sikh refugees should be sent back to pakistan and muslims who had left india be brought back. it didn't make sense. nor did the vicious blood-letting that followed. meanwhile, pakistan had launched its mission to smash and grab jammu & kashmir and was demanding that india hand over rs 55 crore, its share of the cash reserve inherited from the departing british colonial government. the proverbial last straw was gandhi's threat to go on a fast to force the government of india to accept pakistan's demand. in all fairness, it needs to be recalled that jawaharlal nehru was opposed to the idea: he famously declared that giving the money to pakistan would mean providing it with \"sinews of war\". the old man was not listening: in the end, gandhi had his way although people were aghast. but did this gross act of injustice to the people of india and the callous disregard for the sentiments of millions of refugees -- half-a-million people perished in the violence, 12 million were rendered homeless -- justify nathuram godse's action? what inspired narayan apte, son of a well-known historian and sanskrit scholar, to decide on january 13 (the day gandhi declared he would go on a fast to press pakistan's demand for rs 55 crore) that he must turn into a killer? what was madanlal pahwa's role in the conspiracy? and why did badge turn approver? entire generations have come of age since the men who killed gandhi was first published. children are taught in school that gandhi was killed, not why godse and apte and the others did what they did. the new edition of malgonkar's classic answers this and other questions;

{"id": "1177", "text": "Wouldn't you like to be a Piper too?\nThe Great Hihgland Bagpipe is an amazing instrument to hear and to play. Learning to play a bagpipe is one of the greatest challenges in music as it requires much more than talent or natural musical ability. In fact dedication, practice, and following instructions are much more important for developing the technical skills and physical coordination needed to be a piper. I also feel that the piping instructor should have a certain commitment to be thoughtful, encouraging, and sensitive to the needs of the student. Not everyone learns or comprehends things the same way, and instruction should take these differences into account.\nThe Highland Bagpipe is not just fun at parties. Despite its novelty, it is a very real instrument with a long history and a large repertoire. There is a lot to know about bagpipes before one decides to play one. To be sure you are really interested in playing a bgpipe, ask some pipers what it takes to learn to play, or read about bagpipes here, to get a beginning overview of what bagpipes are all about. You may be surprised.\nMany new pipers try to teach themselves to play. This usually presents problems since the music and technique of the pipes are very specific and must be taught by somoene who undestands them. I have had personal experience with this and found in my own piping career that having an instructor is much more productive to the new piper.\nStudents will also learn the proper tuning and maintenance of the bagpipe as soon as possible. One of the most important elements to a good sound is a solid well-tuned instrument, and in the absence of a teacher, a student should be able to make a good attempt at keeping the bagpipe in working order. A bagpipe which sounds good and is in good working order will also encourage more and better practice.\nBesides teaching the best I possibly can and working with each student according to his or her own needs at the appropriate pace, I also aim to make lessons and learning the bagpipe an enjoyable experience. I take things at a speed which will allow thorough covering of all materials in order to build a musical foundation which will make the future brighter and more pleasant. I do not take the fast track at the expense of a student's education. My goal - in short - is to help students reach their goals, while taking the time necessary to yield a rewarding result.\nHow I will teach\nUntil the recent past, bagpipes have been taught in a very old-fashioned way, which - unless the student has prior musical experience - leaves a piper with knowledge of nothing but bagpipes and bagpipe idioms. This can make it difficult for the piper to adapt in situations where performance and cooperation with other musicians are required. I will make every effort to see that a student understands music as well as bagpipes.\nMany casual pipers remain so becasue they never firmly grasp basic musical concepts which would make control and skillful playing more accessible to them.\nWho can be a piper?\nThe main requirement is a commitment to learn. The bagpipe is not the sort of instrument which can be learned simply by osmosis or by fiddling around with it once in awhile. Many people who set out to be pipers realize how much is required of them and quickly lose interest. There is a lot of work involved, but the work doesn't have to be a chore if the student is attentive to instruction and willing to sacrifice some free time. A resolve to practice at least thirty minutes a day in the beginning is a great foundation for becoming a piper.\nAge is not much of an object, though it is a good rule that children be around age 8 or 9 before starting to learn. However there are some very focused 5 and 6-year-olds who have begun the process. The physical strength to support and play a bagpipe may take longer to come at young ages, but this can definitely be dealt with by use of smaller bags, custom fitted blowsticks and properly tied-in drones. A lot of older folks have found piping a satisfying hobby as well. Their main obstacle is not physical but mental. Often adults have difficulty in following literally the instructions given by the teacher. Assuming that they know more than they do is what holds adults back most of the time. But there are many who commit to learning correctly and reach very high proficiency in a short time - comparable to the timeframe in which some younger people learn.\nPrior musical knowledge can help, especially in the early stages, but there is a point at which some retraining of the music brain might need to take place. Piping is a specific style of music which may have some points that are counterintuitive to more common musical practice. But a piper who is already a musician will benefit from this knowledge and likely play more musically at an earlier stage. This having been said, pipes can make a great first instrument. It is possible for a student to learn basic musical principles while learning the bagpipe as he would with the piano or the trumpet. So musical knowledge - though good - is not required.\nAs the ability to play increases and the piper aspires to bigger goals, more demands will be made of his or her time. However these increases are gradual and will be natural as the player's desire to continue increases. Over time a regular thirty-minute practice will exapnd to fill an hour as more and more detailed material is added. People who are ideal candiddates as far as time goes would be singles, retirees, children, homemakers and homeschoolers - but spouses and parents with very understanding families can also do great.\nApart from any obvious physical limitations, pretty much anyone who has the desire and discipline can play the bagpipes. Of course the basic make-up of the person will in some way affect their skill and rate of progress. But if the pipes are learned and practiced correctly, regardless of the talent or skill level of a student, they are very enjoyable to play, and anyone who completes the journey to piperhood definitely has something to be proud of.\nThings a student will need", "scores": {"score": 3, "score_transform_1": 5, "score_transform_2": 5, "score_transform_3": 0}}

{"id": "1183", "text": "Email: email@example.com | Phone: 0097(0)2-298-2059\nIf everything goes as expected next week, with the beginning of proximity talks, thousands of Jews will be marking 43 years since the “unification of Jerusalem.” The politicians will certainly not miss the festive opportunity to express their great love for “our united capital for all eternity.”\nAt that same hour, the police will continue to question municipal leaders who, while singing songs of praise to Jerusalem, lent a hand to the\nconstruction of the monstrous Holyland complex. You don’t need judges in Jerusalem to know that a serious crime was committed against the city with the Holyland. But corruption on the hill in West Jerusalem is nothing compared to the theft of land, identity rape, and the body of lies and criminal discrimination against 270,000 residents of the eastern part of the city.\nAlthough these despicable acts have been going on in broad daylight for years, the public and the media don’t find them interesting. After all, it’s about Arabs. If not for the “unfortunate timing” of the U.S. vice-presidential visit, who would have cared about 1,600 housing units at Ramat Shlomo? Did anyone investigate why, over the opposition of the Israel Lands Administration representative, the District Planning and Building Committee rezoned the land from open space to land for construction? Who knows how many apartments the Housing and Construction Ministry built for young couples from East Jerusalem, which, according to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, is no different than North Tel Aviv?\nA reminder: Since 1967, Israel has expropriated 35 percent of the area of East Jerusalem (around 24 square kilometers). New Jewish neighborhoods were built on those lands, with 50,000 housing units.\nHundreds of developers and contractors (and public employees?) continue to get rich from this construction. How many neighborhoods were built during that time for Arab-Israeli residents? Zero. When was the last time the government supported the construction of 600 apartments in an Arab neighborhood? Thirty years ago. Most of the lands left in the hands of Palestinians (about 45 square kilometers) have been declared “green areas.” Lacking a comprehensive master plan for Jerusalem because of intentional political foot-dragging, building permits cannot be issued for areas outside the densely built-up Palestinian neighborhoods.\nAnd after all that, people on the right dare to complain that Arabs are building without permits, while attempts are being made to “expel” Jews from Beit Yonatan, a large building without a permit that their friends stuck like a bone in the throat of a Palestinian neighborhood. The prime minister is also peddling the line that “a Palestinian from East Jerusalem can build anywhere in the city.” It’s hard to believe that Netanyahu, who was born in Jerusalem, doesn’t know that only Israeli citizens or those entitled to Israeli citizenship through the Law of Return have access to ILA property (93 percent of the land in Israel).\nNot only are Arabs from East Jerusalem not allowed to buy the homes in Talbiyeh (whose name has been officially changed to Komemiyut) where they were born 63 years ago; the law doesn’t permit them to build a home on one-third of the land of East Jerusalem – the area that was expropriated from Palestinians after 1967. In contrast, Nobel Peace Prize laureate Elie Wiesel, who demanded that U.S. President Barack Obama leave Jerusalem alone, is welcome to purchase a vacation apartment in the new Jewish housing project in Sheikh Jarrah.\nWhile children in West Jerusalem schools are celebrating “Jerusalem Day,” thousands of children in East Jerusalem will stay home or crowd into rickety schoolrooms. The education minister and the mayor, who will praise the “unification of Jerusalem,” are among those continually defaulting on the pledge to the High Court of Justice to build some 250 of the more than 1,000 classrooms that are lacking in the city.\nAnd people who disregard Israel’s High Court will have no trouble ignoring agreements with foreigners. Who remembers that according to phase one of the road map that the Israeli government was to reopen the Palestinian Chamber of Commerce and other shuttered Palestinian institutions in East Jerusalem, pledging that they would operate based on previous agreements?\n“For Zion’s sake will I not hold My peace, and for Jerusalem’s sake I will not rest, until her triumph go forth as brightness, and her salvation as a torch that burneth, and the nations shall see thy triumph, and all kings thy glory,” wrote the prophet Isaiah. It’s hard to believe that proximity talks will bring peace into closer proximity between Israel and the Palestinians. But if they help replace baseless, sickly sweet declarations with just a little more justice and wisdom emanating from Jerusalem, as the prophet envisioned, that will be enough.", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

Shelly Short, the ranking Republican on the committee, called the bill a “job killer” and said it will cause many businesses – and the jobs they provide – to leave the state.\n“We heard testimony in committee from companies that are literally waiting to see what we do with this bill,” said Short, R-Addy. “They are on the verge of packing it in and moving to Idaho and other states. This is also going to raise utility rates and the costs of goods and services for our families.”\nHouse Bill 1819 is legislation requested by the governor. It is the result of Washington’s participation in the Western Climate Initiative, which currently includes six states and four Canadian provinces. The legislation seeks to limit the amount of carbon emitted in the state from manufacturing and energy-producing businesses. Companies that fail to comply face massive fines, can purchase carbon credits at auction, or pursue emission offsets.\n“Washington is already one of the cleanest state’s in the nation and only accounts for one-third of one percent of global greenhouse gasses,” Short said. “It seems to me that we are taking an unnecessary lead and an unnecessary risk with this legislation. What kind of disadvantages are we creating for our businesses if they have to compete regionally and globally with companies that don’t have to abide by these strict regulations? How are we providing certainty for our businesses when we don’t know the costs associated with this legislation?\n“This is precisely the wrong time to be adding punitive and costly regulations on our employers,” Short said.\nHouse Republicans proposed 13 amendments in committee, all of which – save one – were rejected along party lines.\nThe one House Republican amendment that was adopted requires the Office of Financial Management to report on the legislation’s impact to Washington ports.\n“We have a very trade dependent state,” Short said. “Apart from the concerns we have with businesses, utility bills and agriculture, we also need to make sure we’re not adversely affecting our ports and our ability to import and export the goods upon which our economy thrives.”\nShort said the biggest surprise of the committee meeting was a Democrat amendment that removed the term “green jobs” from the bill.\n“We’ve heard so much talk about green jobs this year and the creation of green jobs. We offered an amendment that would specifically define ‘green jobs’ because there seems to be an awful lot of discrepancy as to what qualifies as one,” Short said. “That amendment was defeated, but shortly afterward the Democrats offered an amendment to take the term ‘green jobs’ out of the bill, so I think our point was made.”\n# # #\n###Washington State House Republican Communications", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

{"id": "1187", "text": "- Galaxy AI is a suite of generative AI tools that can respond to text prompts and understand more than just text using multimodal input.\n- Galaxy AI features include Circle to Search, Browsing Assist, Transcript Assist, Photo Assist, Generative Edit, Call Assist/Live Translate, Chat Assist, and Note Assist.\n- Galaxy AI features will be free until the end of 2025, after which there may be a subscription fee to use them. Some features may be affected, but details have not been specified.\nYou won’t find a Galaxy S24 ad without the “Galaxy AI” buzzword attached to it. Samsung is hyping up Galaxy AI to be a “new era of mobile AI” that will change the way we experience the world. That sounds exciting, but what actually is Galaxy AI, and is it even something worth buying a new phone for?\nWhat is Galaxy AI?\nGalaxy AI is a suite of generative AI tools that respond to text prompts, similar to ChatGPT, but can also understand more than just text. This is thanks to something called “multimodal input.”\nFor starters, Galaxy AI can write messages for you, do live translations, summarize notes, and write messages for you. The multimodal input allows Galaxy AI to help with more than text-based prompts and tasks. “Circle to Search,” for example, enables Google Lens-style searches by simply circling anything on the screen. There are also some AI-infused photo editing features.\nGalaxy AI is powered by Google’s Gemini Pro and Imagen 2 AI models, which are the next evolution of what was formerly called “Bard.” Most of the simple Galaxy AI tools are small enough to run locally right on your device, but the larger tasks require an internet connection to run in the Google Cloud.\nGalaxy AI Features\nGalaxy AI launched on the Samsung Galaxy S24 series with six main tools. Some of these features already existed on Samsung devices without the “AI” term applied to them.\n- Circle to Search: Lets you search for anything on Google by simply circling it on your screen.\n- Browsing Assist: Summarizes articles and webpages, highlighting the key points to save you time from scrolling.\n- Transcript Assist: Converts voice recordings and conversations into text. Automatically identifies multiple speakers.\n- Photo Assist: The Gallery app can make suggestions on which edits you can use to enhance the image.\n- Generative Edit: Allows you to edit your photos with the help of AI. You can erase unwanted objects, recompose the image, and remaster the quality with just a few taps. You can also use Generative Edit to create artistic effects and filters for your photos.\n- Call Assist/Live Translate: Helps you communicate with people who speak different languages. You can use Live Translate to get real-time voice and text translations for phone calls and messages.\n- Chat Assist: Attempts to improve your writing style in messages and emails with suggestions.\n- Note Assist: Auto-formatting, summarising, spelling correction, translation, and generating covers for your notes in the Samsung Notes app. Can also take handwritten notes and convert them to text.\nGalaxy AI Won’t Be Free Forever\nWhile all of the Galaxy AI features may sound pretty cool, there is a pretty big catch: these features won’t be free forever. Samsung says that Galaxy AI features will be free until the end of 2025, after which you may have to pay a subscription fee to use them. Samsung hasn’t specified which features will be affected or how much they will cost.\nThe company may be referring to cloud-based AI tools, such as Generative Edit, which require a lot of resources to run. On-device AI tools, such as Live Translation, may be unaffected. None of this has been confirmed, however. We only know that Galaxy AI will be provided in full for free until 2025.\nSamsung Phones With Galaxy AI\nGalaxy AI launched on the Samsung Galaxy S24 series in Janurary 2024. That includes the Galaxy S24 Ultra, Galaxy S24+, and the Galaxy S24. Circle to Search is not exclusive to Samsung phones—it’s also available on the Google Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro.\nSamsung has announced that some of its Galaxy AI features will be coming to older models in the months following the Galaxy S24 launch. However, only four features have been confirmed so far: Circle to Search, Live Translate, Photo Assist, and Note Assist. These features will be available for the Galaxy S23 series, Galaxy Z Fold and Flip 5, and the Galaxy Tab S9. Other features may not be supported on older devices.\nIt was only a matter of time before Samsung got in on the AI train. Thankfully, Galaxy AI is mostly a set of tools that provide genuinely helpful features. Many of the features were already on Samsung devices, just not under the “AI” umbrella.", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}
{"id": "1189", "text": "Last few months Soprex was hiring new people which also meant I had to:\n- read a lot of CV-s\n- hold technical interviews\n- judge people\n- neglect my regular duties\nAs you can guess I wasn't too happy about it because I had other important staff to do and I don't like judging people, especially not based on some resume. But still, this is a small effort compared to potential impact on our firm. Last thing you want to do is to misjudge people and spend few months getting them in the business to find out that it is not going to work out.\nDavid Parnas said:\nQ: What is the most often-overlooked risk in software engineering?\nA: Incompetent programmers. There are estimates that the number of programmers needed in the U.S. exceeds 200,000. This is entirely misleading. It is not a quantity problem; we have a quality problem. One bad programmer can easily create two new jobs a year. Hiring more bad programmers will just increase our perceived need for them. If we had more good programmers, and could easily identify them, we would need fewer, not more.\nThe whole CV evaluation process would be much simpler if CV-s I have read were better written. When I open a CV I want to see candidate's:\n- Working history and experience\n- names of the companies and employment period\n- projects on which candidate has worked on, with short description of project domain, used technologies and candidate's role in project\nI was horrified to find out that most of CV-s didn't include information about candidate age nor his/hers picture. You might argue that these are not relevant factors but I think they are, especially once you want to build picture about some person in few minutes.\nInformation about education was usually present but it was usually encrypted in English form so we were constantly guessing which colleague candidate meant.\nOn the other hand, working experience is the key information and it was almost always present in some form. If we had additional questions or misunderstandings regarding it we called candidates on the phone to ask them additional questions to get a clearer picture.\nCV trash talk\nWith all this badly written CV-s and my other responsibilities, I was trying to make a person assessment keeping in mind that great engineers don't necessarily write great CV-s.\nAbove all listed problems one really annoyed me, the corporate trash talk. The worse the candidate was there was more trash talk. It turned out that every candidate:\n- is motivated to work in dynamic environment\n- is eager to learn new technologies and advance\n- works great under pressure\n- is a team player\n- has excellent communication and organizational skills\n- is self-motivated and self-organized\nDisaster... I am not sure why is this corporate trash talk culture happening but it’s definitely out there. One thing is for sure, it is not the truth nor relevant and I don't want to read it.\nThe horrible truth\nAt some point I started to nag to my manager that I don't want to see any CV ever again. So she showed me the horrible truth... my own CV.\nOh my God! I haven't seen it for almost 3 years and it was horrible. No I'm not going to show it to you. I will just show you a small quote (trash) from it:\nTo use my IT knowledge, theoretical and practical software development and management skills in dynamical environment which will give me opportunity to advance in further professional carrier.\nGuess what I learned is that you can't really judge a person by his resume but at the end you have to. You must try to read between the lines (trash) and you must not hesitate to spend a lot of time on it because new employees can make a huge difference. You might be getting your new super-problem-solving-best-friend or your worst nightmare.\nMissing data gathering also turned out to be useful. Few minutes of talk over the phone can make much difference in understanding some resume and making better and faster decisions. It would probably help if we created some CV template or little guide for writing it.\nIn the effort to follow my own CV advices I have updated my objectives.\nMy new objectives:\n- To satisfy customer with the simplest solution\n- To get better at it", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

{"id": "1191", "text": "“The road to hard-town is paved with opportunity and blood,” the saying went around the slum. Rehki felt a thousand eyes watching her as she passed the shady shelters, brothels and bars. If there was a prosperous area of the slum, hard-town was as close as it got. While the sturdy buildings didn’t look like they would crumble in a strong wind, they were still a far cry from even the modest apartments of low-town. Broad-shouldered goons in clean suits stood guard at the entrances, their hands ready to snatch a concealed weapon at any time. Their faces growled “Get lost.”\nRehki had only been to hard-town once before, over a year ago when Ankit delivered a new tablet to one of the lower-rank Goonda’s. He paid Ankit well, not that Rehki saw a cent of the money. But the week after the transaction was one of the least stressful of her entire life. When Ankit had money, he wasn’t such a bad person to be around. When he didn’t, he was a smoking volcano that could erupt any moment.\nEventually she found her way back to the same establishment, a seedy lounge called Shivaji Vapors. One of the two looming goons in front stuck an arm out to block her entrance. “Too young,” he hissed.\n“I’m here to see Arjun,” she said as she looked down to her feet.\n“Fine. Then when the next Goonda gets what I’ve got, you can tell Arjun that he had first shot and missed it because of you.”\n“Whatchu got to see Arjun about then?” he growled as he sized her up.\n“An opportunity,” she answered placing a hand on the duffel bag. Slowly, she unzipped it, just enough to show the interface inside.\nThe goon held up his phone and snapped a picture of it and her. “Stay,” he said as he nodded to the other guard. Rehki stepped back away from the entrance to wait.\nShivaji Vapors sat at the edge of one of the biggest and most active bazaars in the slum. People only came to hard-town if they had to, when they wanted something; when they were willing to sacrifice something personal and important. Rehki could easily pick out the desperate from the benefactors just by the way they walked, if not by the quality of the clothes they wore or the smells they produced. Her overalls, tank top and shaggy hair easily pegged her among the most desperate.\nBut in her mind, Rehki was preparing a mini-checklist of things to do with the spaceship after this unpleasant experience was over.\nAfter a few minutes, the door opened and the goon returned. “Open the bag.” Rehki unzipped it and offered it to him, avoiding direct eye contact. He nudged the interface with his knuckles, like an ape trying to figure out the best way to pick up a banana. “What is it?” he grumbled.\n“I’m not here to do business with you,” Rehki answered cooly.\n“You won’t do business with nobody if I break that pretty little jaw,” he hissed as he loomed over her, his hands balling into massive fists.\n“Give the kid a break,” the other goon moaned. “What’d he say?”\n“Inside,” the first goon growled, and Rehki hurried inside.\nThe inside of Shivaji Vapors was much nicer than the workshop but just as dimly lit. There were a dozen round tables spread throughout the room, most of which were empty. Rehki had no doubt they’d been full just a few hours ago as the parties went deep into the night. She saw a few girls not much older than her cleaning up the floor. They avoided eye contact as she walked past. The goon took her back behind the stage and knocked on a wall. A moment later, the wall opened up to reveal a doorway to what must have been the back office. Rehki skirted past the goon through the opening. Then he stepped in behind her and shut the door.\nThe office was roomy, filled with bookshelves and file cabinets of different sizes and two beautiful leather couches that faced each other, separated by a small coffee table. A middle-aged woman slept on one of the couches, her naked torso emerged from the woven blanket at her waist. On the far side of the room, a large wooden desk filled the space, and behind it, sitting in a thick leather chair, was Arjun. He looked exactly the same as Rehki remembered, young, rich and a breath away from committing a violent act.\n“Who are you,” Arjun asked without looking up from his tablet, “and what do you want?”\n“My name is Rehki. I don’t know if you remember me or not. I’m under contract with Ankit Kumar and his tech shop. We provided that tablet to you last year.”\nArjun considered her for a moment. “I don’t remember you or anyone named Ankit Kumar.”\nRehki wasn’t surprised. Ankit hadn’t been memorable that morning at all. As good a tech as he was, he made a lousy salesman. “How’s it working for you? The tablet, I mean.”\n“It’s fine. In fact, it’s the only tech in the place that hasn’t broken down in a year.”\n“That’s because I fixed it.”\nArjun choked a laugh. “You fixed it?”\n“Most techs in the slum build in a timed failure or bug. Helps generate return business. I made sure your tablet didn’t have anything like that. Just another service that Kumar Tech provides like no one else,” she sang while forcing a smile onto her face.\nArjun’s face twisted with annoyance. “I’ll have to remember that.” He leaned back in his chair and slowly laced his fingers together. His handsome face was just as appealing to Rehki as it was frightening. “So, what sort of tech does Kumar have for me now, assuming it won’t break in a few months.”\n“Not him. Me.”\n“Really?,” he chuckled. The goon behind her grunted too. “Well then, by all means. Please sit down.” He gestured to a chair on the opposite side of his desk. She moved carefully to sit down, noting that neither the goon nor the girl moved an inch. “What’s your name again, girl?”\n“Okay, Rehki. What do you have for me today?”\n“Tell me, how do you communicate with your guys out there in hard-town?”\nArjun paused. “Same as everyone else. Our phones. Why?”\n“What if I could give you something better? Something private. Something no other Goonda or thug could use but you and your people. No hacking. No spying. No one will even know it’s there.”\n“And how are you going to provide that, little girl?”\n“May I have my bag back?”\nArjun gestured with a finger, and the goon dropped the duffel on the desk so hard that Rehki winced. She hoped the interface wasn’t damaged. Arjun peeked inside. “What is it?”\n“That’s a cell tower interface. Straight from high-town and the BMC.”\n“So? Plenty of those around the slum. Have to be, or our phones are just bricks.”\n“That’s right.” Rehki caught herself making direct eye contact and forced herself to look at his red velvet vest instead. “I’m repairing this one for the BMC right now.”\n“I don’t see how that helps me.”\n“I can setup this interface to include a private channel, just for you and your goon … I mean, team. Only you have access to it or know the frequency.”\n“You’re saying we use BMC tech but only we can use the links?”\n“That’s right. Complete autonomy. I’ll make it hacker-proof and 100 percent yours. As long as none of your people reveal its existence, no one will ever know it’s even there.”\n“Even the BMC?”\n“To them, it’ll just look like a out-of-band maintenance channel. They’ll ignore it. Once I program this interface and re-link it to the cell hive, my config will spread to every interface in the slum, and, bam, you’ve got your own private cellular network.”\nArjun smiled in spite of himself. “Tempting, techie. What’s your price?”\n“I need a power cell with solar charging station.”\nArjun busted out laughing. Rehki assumed he knew the importance of what she was asking for. The girl stirred on the couch, pulling the blanket up over her head. “What’s a gulama going to do with a power cell like that?”\n“Nothing that will concern you. You give me a working cell and charging station, you get your own private cell phone network everywhere in the slum. Seems like a bargain for you.”\n“Watch your tongue, child,” Arjun snapped as he rose from his chair. He took a deep inhale from his vaper, and his torso quivered with the rush. Rehki sat still, her eyes fixed on the top of the desk but not reading anything. “What if it breaks? Not like the BMC will answer my calls.”\nRehki had dreaded this. “It won’t break,” she said less convincingly than she’d hoped.\n“Like all the other tech around here? No. You work for me now. You keep my network up and running 24-7. You come when I call, gulama.”\nRehki gulped. “Yes, sir.”\n“Good.” Arjun paused. “Why me?”\n“What?” Rehki asked before stopping herself.\n“You heard me,” Arjun hissed as he eased onto the edge of the desk. “Why give this tech to me? There’s any number of Goonda’s out there who would pay more than a power cell for tech like this.”\n“They’d probably kill me after it was online.”\nArjun nodded. “Probably would at that. You’d be a loose end they couldn’t control. Tell me, why don’t I have the same problem?”\n“Because you’re not like them,” Rehki said, looking up but not directly at him. “Word gets up north fast. You’re looking to monopolize the vaping taverns around the slum. Most of us would prefer you running them over the other Goonda’s, anyway. Easier access, lower costs, less hassles or shake-downs. You know your customers are already screwed, so why punish them more than necessary? You just take what you want and go. We know you’ll be fair. That’s why I know you’ll be fair with me now.”\nArjun took another deep vape. “How long would you need to get me my network?”\n“So, we’re agreed?”\n“Yes. We’re agreed. You deliver me my own cell network and keep it running, you get your own power cell.”\nShe rose from her chair. “If I get to work right now, I’ll have it up and running in a few hours.” She gulped. “With your permission, of course.”\n“Vimul,” Arjun gestured to the goon, “get her whatever she needs, then keep an eye on her. She does anything you don’t like, break her neck.”\n“Yes, boss,” Vimul answered in a cheerful way that sent a chill up Rehki’s spine.\n“Don’t cross me, gulama Rehki,” Arjun whispered as he planted a fingertip onto her sternum. “I don’t like people who show up out of the blue with deals of a lifetime. They’ve always got some angle. I don’t know what yours is just yet, but I will, and when I do, if I don’t like it, it will stop, and then, you will stop. You understand me?”\n“Yes, Mr. Arjun,” Rehki muttered, her face directed straight to the ground.\n“Good. Then get to work.” He moved back to his chair and turned his attention to his tablet.\nRehki opened her mouth to thank him, but stopped herself. She knew better. Instead, she bowed and then walked back toward Vimul. “I’m going to need some tools and access to the roof,” she said.\nVimul grunted and then opened the door. “Let’s go, kid,” and he pushed her out the door. Rehki risked a quick glance behind her. Arjun was watching her the whole time, his blue eyes piercing through the haze of his vape straight at her. A terrifying smile slowly grew at the edge of his mouth as the wall closed between them.", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

During nap time, Andy snuck out of his room went down to my bathroom took the toothpaste and Kevin's toothbrush back to his bathroom where he did heaven knows what with them causing me to have to throw out the toothbrush because he loves to play in the potty. Then he climbed up on the sink, opened the medicine cabinet turned on Emma's Hello Kitty toothbrush and started clearing the shelves of all the (thankfully) childproof-capped medicine. My kitchen floor is covered in chunks of grilled cheese, dried-up and stuck-on Rice Krispies and drips of milk from the \"drip-proof\" cups.

All the girls wore red leotards and white tutus with sequence. Emma's class danced to \"Jolly Old St. Nicholas\". So there she was with 7 other girls.

She performed flawlessly as did maybe 2 other girls. The rest were standing or waving, one was crying. Then the girls had to gallop in a circle, but only 5 of them wanted to. The other 2 were planted firmly in their spots until the circle met them. Then the traffic stalled. I could see Emma up there saying \"Go!\" and she pushed a little girl out of the way so the rest of them could finish. It was all very graceful and done on tip-toe. At the end of the performance the girls all blew kisses to the audience.\nThe rest of the show was pretty much the same. Adorable girls galloping into a dead stop when someone else didn't move. Another girl ran off stage to kiss her mom and was brought back only to spend the whole song tying her ballet slippers.\nI can tell you this: Even when my kids are grown, I will never turn down an invitation to a preschool dance recital.

It seems the author is reinventing himself one more time in what amounts this time to a veritable metamorphosis. In the past four decades, Dr. Fernandez (阿列尔·费尔南德) has contributed five books and more than 400 research papers to areas as distant as abstract algebra, topological dynamics, chemical physics, biophysics, evolutionary biology and rational drug design, among others. As if that weren’t enough, when the pandemic stroke he turned himself into an expert on Covid-19 and did so in no time flat. This is attested by the fact that Ariel Fernandez’ contributions to the field of Covid-19 were cited by the Wuhan Institute of Virology, the institution at the forefront of the research on Covid-19 (for better or for worse, but that is another story). On an even more recent and dramatic turn in his career, Ariel Fernandez is now leveraging artificial intelligence for meta-model discovery in areas such as cosmology and particle physics, where big data demands a massive modeling effort and data-driven research has not always found its footing. Ariel Fernandez’ new book is placed a the forefront of this endeavor, taking model discovery to the next level: the development of “machine intuition”. This type of intuition is enshrined in the concept of “metamodel”. A metamodel is a more primitive and yet in some ways a more sophisticated entity than a model. Fernandez has compared a metamodel with a Picasso painting of his late period contrasted with the more “academic” works of his youth…\nThe book is entitled “Topological Dynamics in Metamodel Discovery with Artificial Intelligence: From Biomedical to Cosmological Technologies”. With the implementation of topological methods to construct meta-models, Ariel Fernandez’ book engages with levels of complexity and multiscale hierarchies so far considered off limits for data science. The book paves the way to Fernandez’ project for 2023: Reverse engineer the Standard Model of particle physics through artificial intelligence in order to unravel the origin and nature of dark matter and dark energy.

If I use them, the house will require more energy to keep it warm, such that I will need an external air source heat pump, rather that the internal Nibe unit currently planned.\nWhich blocks should I use?\nI prefer dense concrete blocks. They are stronger, better for sound insulation, and have a much higher thermal mass. If you have insulation in the cavities, which I presume you will, then the house will not require more energy to heat. The higher thermal mass of the concrete blocks will help smooth-out temperature fluctuations.\nI disagree that heat pumps are “energy efficient”. They use electricity as a fuel, which is three to four times more expensive than gas or oil.

{"id": "1198", "text": "Miners based in mainland China are once again buying used BTC mining rigs and other equipment, as well as making deals. These include other mining farms and hydroelectric plants. Analysts believe that the abundant water expected this summer will push the business back into the profitable space. It is already known that the season produces a significant amount of additional electricity in the hundreds of hydro power plants and stations.\nThis is especially true for the facilities in the southwestern provinces of Yunnan and Sichuan, where numerous mountains are located. The level of extra power provides competitive bills for electricity that bitcoin miners get. This makes the season a rare opportunity to earn a higher profit margin than that of the current bear market can otherwise provide.\nThe numbers are clear for some companies. Hashage is one such business in the city of Chengdu. It operates six farms that can supply around 200,000 sloths for rigs and they have a precise calculation for the upcoming period. During the summer months, the price of a kilowatt-hour is about 0.25 yuan. This is around $0.037 and a really low price – by comparison, an average kilowatt-hour in the US is $0.12.\nZheng, the CEO of Hashage believes that there is a growing interest in the mining operation. According to him, miners are slowly moving their focus to the Xinjiang and Inner Mongolia provinces where they can operate mining farms that run on fossil power. The costs of these operations run around 0.35 yuan or half a US cent per 1 kWh.\nHowever, even a difference of just $0.0015 can make or break the bottom line for miners, especially when it comes to the market like the one today where a BTC token is worth $3,700. Bitmain’s AntMiner S9 rig uses about 30 kWh per day which is more than an average US household in 2017. The amount of power consumed is staggering when the returns are counted into the calculation. Here, a $0.045 savings per day means that a mining operation of 10,000 rigs saves over $13,000 each month.\nAnother factor driving the revival in the industry is the fact that second-hand BTC ASICs are offered relatively cheaply. The same applies in particular to the ANtMiner S9s that can be attained using really modest funds. According to Zheng, there are used S9 rigs that can be purchased for $150 while they provide a capacity of 10 trillion TH/s. The same fact is seen in online sellers of S9s that are on the Alibaba marketplace. Here, rigs can be found for the price as low as $100.\nThe higher-priced models are sold for $200 each. A new S9 as sold on the Bitmain’s official website goes for about $450, but the wholesale dealers of the new S9 rigs are selling them for about $300. Other Chinese bitcoin entrepreneurs are pointing out that the previous round of miner shutdowns and busts took place at the end of 2018.\nThis flooded the market with rigs, especially the mentioned S9. As Tyler Xiong, the marketing officer of Bixin, the mining pool and wallet service noticed, these rigs are like AK-47 rifles in the world of weapon market – they offer the best performance over cost ratio and provide companies with a good alternative. In fact, many including Bixin are not considering any other option than to invest money in S9 and set up their own mining operations.\nDiverse Business Setup\nThe range of possibilities that a mining company or a cryptocurrency company, in general, can attain with the power suppliers is big. That is why Zheng says that his company, asides from hosting machines for mines is also planning to put about 20,000 of its own ASICs to work. This would allow the company to generate both fiat and crypto profits at the same time. He also thinks that the positive climate will boost the hash rates of the entire bitcoin network this summer.\nAccording to his assessment, the network rate could reach 70 EH/s (quintillion hashes per second). This number is well beyond the number of 61 EH/s that was recorded a year before in the summer of 2018. The growth is already visible in the network, especially in a previous couple of months. At the start of January, the rate as about 35 EH/s while it is currently about 42 EH/s on average. Now, Zheng believes that it is only a question of how many miners will be willing to take the bet on bitcoin in the coming months.\nNew Market Dynamic\nWhile there are ample rains and water in many of the mentioned locations all of the time, this year there also appears to be a different kind of market dynamic. In a market geared towards the bills, there was a persistent difficulty in buying mining gear and locating slots in mining farms.\nBut, the price of electricity was not that big and getting into the actual operations was not an issue because the profits managed to cover the costs. In a bear market like the one now, the electricity means the positive difference between costs and profit that all of the miners are struggling to find. In other words, it is all about better utilization of resources and organizing together for that profit margin.\nIn an environment like that, those miners who can farm using the cheapest cost of electricity will be the winners. This also means that producers of new gear will not reap the benefits – GPU companies will need to sell their units to gamers and esports organization, not individual miners as before. Right now, the market for used rigs is so tightly packed that few will go for new units.\nIn previous years, some news pointed towards the government of China clamping down on mining operations. Right now, there seems to be little if any concern about that issue, which points towards the option of the government turning a blind eye to the new operations. In that case, the upcoming summer will be able to take off many used mining rigs from the hands of the sellers and put some newly mined BTC tokens into the hands of Chinese crypto companies and mining operators.", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}

{"id": "1204", "text": "As a child, Devante Johnson’s future seemed to be full of promise. He made excellent grades in school and was a help around the house. His mother, Tamika Scott, worked hard, managing to raise three boys while pursuing a career, buying a house and completing a college degree. Mrs. Scott had a 401(k) retirement fund and private health insurance and was confident she was prepared for unforeseen emergencies. At 29, she took comfort in the belief that her family was secure.\nBut as we reported two years ago, her family’s middle class security crumbled when her doctors told her she had Multiple Sclerosis and strongly urged her to leave her job because the stress of work would make her condition worse. With the dramatic loss of income and insurance, everything she was building began to slip away as she cashed in stocks and used money from her retirement fund to pay bills.\nFifteen months later, her problems worsened. Her oldest son, Devante, then 10, was diagnosed with advanced kidney cancer. Because of the family’s reduced income, the six months of chemotherapy treatments Devante received were covered by Medicaid. At the end of the treatments, the doctors pronounced him cured. Six months later, the cancer returned. Devante and his mother were then told that a new three-year course of chemotherapy, radiation and constant monitoring were critical to Devante’s recovery. As a testament to his character, Devante remained upbeat and optimistic about the new treatment.\nTamika Scott didn’t plan to rely on government supported health insurance to protect her children but she had no other option. Devante’s Medicaid coverage was essential for him to receive the life-saving care he required. Two months before the expiration of his Medicaid coverage, she submitted an application for Medicaid renewal to the Texas Department of Human Services, confident that two months was more than sufficient time for the application to be processed to allow her child’s health care to continue without any interruption in coverage. One month before the deadline, she became concerned because she hadn’t received notice that the application had been approved.\nBut there was still time she thought. However, to be on the safe side, Tamika Scott submitted two more completed applications, followed up with dozens of phone calls, and faxed supplemental information. After six weeks, she found out that Devante’s Medicaid application had not been approved and that it was going to be sent for verification of eligibility in the Texas Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP). When she contacted the CHIP agency to check the status of Devante’s application, she was repeatedly told they hadn’t received it. The expiration date for Devante’s coverage came shortly thereafter, and his access to life giving care was cut off. His treatments immediately stopped.\nTamika Scott re-mailed and re-faxed the application as she watched her son get sicker with no way to get him the treatment needed to save his life. Devante’s growing tumor became a visibly protruding lump on his back. His pain increased and walking became difficult. He lost twenty pounds. He had to rely on free samples of experimental drugs as the only treatment available to him. But he didn’t give up and never complained.\nMrs. Scott inquired on numerous occasions about the status of his application but never got a satisfactory answer. For four months, no one in the Department of Human Services told her the application was lost in the system and had never been processed. With no where else to turn, she appealed to her state representative. Through his intervention, Devante’s health coverage was restored in one day. He was transferred to the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center where he received first rate, comprehensive care. But it was too late. Devante Johnson, courageous to the end, died on March 1, 2007. He was 14. The medical cause of death was complications from advanced cancer.\nHe also died from a shameful and preventable failure of state and federal systems and the lack of a commitment to make sure every child in America gets the health coverage for which they are eligible. That’s why I’m calling on each of you to join us now in demanding that Congress enact child health care reform legislation that simplifies children getting and staying enrolled in health care regardless of where they live in America.\nTo avoid more deaths like Devante’s, access to health care must be simple and seamless. Currently, six million of the nation’s nine million uninsured children are eligible for but not enrolled in Medicaid and CHIP largely because of state-imposed barriers that Congress can and must eliminate this year. These include known obstacles to enrollment like waiting lists and face-to-face interviews. Ultimately, the bill Congress passes must leave children better off than they are now, and in no case should any child be worse off. Congress is not there yet and they need to hear from you.", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}

Hence, an AMD motherboard would only work with an AMD processor, and likewise, an Intel motherboard will only work with an Intel processor, and not the other way around.\nA motherboard is an essential component of any computer. It is a printed circuit board (PCB) that is responsible for holding all of the crucial components of the system, including but not limited to the CPU and memory. The motherboard also provides connectors for other peripherals devices, such as the DVD player, USB drives, sound cards, video cards, network cards, etc. It also provides electrical pathways so that the components attached to it can communicate.\nIntel and AMD are two of the many companies that make and sell motherboards. The main difference between AMD and Intel motherboards is that they only accept the same kind of processor. Hence, an AMD motherboard would only work with an AMD processor, and likewise, an Intel motherboard will only work with an Intel processor, and not the other way around.\nOther companies also produce motherboards that are compatible with one of the processors. However, till date, there are no motherboards that are compatible with both the processors. The reason for this is the fact that each processor requires a different socket type. Intel motherboards have LGA 1156 and LGA 1366 sockets, while AMD motherboards have AM2 and AM3 sockets.\nHowever, the fact that an AMD motherboard would only work with an AMD processor, and likewise for Intel, the sales and market share of Intel and AMD motherboards directly correspond to the sales and market share of Intel and AMD processors. AMD is the only significant rival to Intel in the central processor (CPU) market, especially for the x86 based personal computers. Together, Intel and AMD hold 99.1% market share of the CPUs sold for Q3/2011. In this, Intel had an 80.3%, share while, AMD amounted to 18.8%.\nAMD and Intel are always competing with each other. They always aim to come out with the next best thing and stay a step ahead of each other. Hence, their products are always closely related with minor differences that each of the company thinks will make their product better. Due to this, the two motherboards are virtually the same, other than in terms of processor compatibility. They have similar components like memory, hard drives, graphics cards, etc., as all these components have been more or less standardized and hence use the same slots.\nThe number of slots and the amount of RAM that the motherboard can accommodate is mainly dependent on the make and model of the motherboard. This of course has an effect on pricing. Hence, a motherboard with more SATA ports and/or with more RAM compatibility will cost more.\nHowever, a generalization is that AMD tends to be quite a bit cheaper than Intel. Intel is considered by most to have a better performance, even if by a slight margin. Due to this, Intel is considered to be priced higher. Hence, AMD is now considered to be the budget choice, whereas Intel has become synonymous with a performance choice. Still, a number of people tend to choose AMD over Intel because the AMD and Intel chips and circuit boards provide almost identical functionality, but the AMD version is much cheaper.\nImage Courtesy: worldcomputerfair.blogspot.com, topnews.in", "scores": {"score": 3, "score_transform_1": 5, "score_transform_2": 5, "score_transform_3": 0}}
{"id": "1212", "text": "Difference between Atom and ion\nKey Difference: Atoms are the basic units that all matter is made of and they are the smallest part of any object. An ion is any atom whose protons do not equal its electrons.\nAtom and ion are two different terms that are a major part of chemistry. These two terms make up chemistry’s basic foundation and a person looking to understand how things are made up will find they will have to understand these terms completely. An atom is the smallest part of any object. An ion is an atom or molecule whose total number of electrons does not equal the total number of protons. It’s a bit confusing for learners until they get the concept down.\nAtoms are the basic units that all matter is made of. Atoms are tiny, ranging from 0.1 to 0.5 nanometers in width. They are so tiny that they cannot even be seen through a microscope. There are many types of atoms. Each atom has a unique name, mass and size. The different types of atoms are called elements.\nAn element is a pure chemical substance that has one or one type of atom, distinguished by its atomic number. The atomic number is derived from the number of protons present in the element’s nucleus. There are a total of 118 elements that have been identified, divided between metal, metalloids and non-metals. Each element has its own set of properties. Most elements are available on the earth, while a few have been developed artificially through nuclear reactions. An element is already in its rawest form and cannot be further broken down. All of the elements can be found in the Periodic Table, listed by atomic number.\nEach atom of any element is made up of protons, neutrons and electrons. The protons and neutrons make up the nucleus of the atom and are situated in the middle of the atom. The nucleus is surrounded by a cloud of electrons which are bound to the nucleus by an electromagnetic force. The electrons have a negative charge which is how they are attracted to the nucleus, as the protons in the nucleus have a positive charge. Neutrons, on the other hand, do not have a charge. The number of protons, neutrons and electrons in an atom determine which element it is. For example: An atom of iron has 26 protons, 30 neutrons and 26 electrons. Each atom of iron will have this configuration.\nAs you can see in the example, an atom of iron has 26 protons and 26 electrons. Each atom that has not created any bond will have an equal number of protons and electrons. Because an atom cannot exist freely in the natural world, they readily bond with other atoms that are available. When an atom bonds it either loses or gains electrons. If one atom bonds with another atom, one atom will have to lose an electron while the other atom will gain an electron. This gives the atom a positive or a negative electric charge. Atoms whose protons do not equal its electrons are ions.\nIons are created by chemical or physical means. There are two types of ions: cation and anion. A neutral atom that loses an electron is considered to have a positive charge because of a higher number of protons and is known as a cation. An atom that gains an electron has a higher number of electrons than protons and is considered to have a negative charge and is considered as an anion. An ion consisting of a single atom is an atomic or monatomic ion; if it consists of two or more atoms, it is a molecular or polyatomic ion.\nIons are highly reactive and they bond with ions of an opposite charge to become stable. Ions in a gas-like stage is flammable and are found only in small amounts on Earth, such as in flames, lightning, electrical sparks and other plasmas. Ions that are in liquid or solid state often interact and bond with solvents to become more stable. All ions are charged, which means they have a few main characteristics: they are attracted to opposite electric charges, repelled by like charges, when moving they travel in trajectories and they are deflected by a magnetic field.\nImage Courtesy: ducksters.com, elvomitar.blogspot.com", "scores": {"score": 3, "score_transform_1": 5, "score_transform_2": 5, "score_transform_3": 0}}

When she was born, with all the hubris of a new mom I marveled at all the amazing things she did and I assumed she'd speed her way through all her milestones. And she did... until she didn't. It shook my world the first time I heard the phrase \"severe language delay\" and I was plagued with guilt and even a little shame. \"Where had we gone wrong?\" \"How had I missed this?\" When we realized that she's Autistic I remember feeling afraid that she wouldn't be able to keep up with her peers. I think there's a lot of pressure on parents for their children to somehow \"measure up\" and I think it's making us crazy! It took a long time for me to realize how silly it is to expect people to learn at the same pace when we're all so different.\nAs most first time parents do, we eventually learned the peace and relief that come when you finally toss away the invisible measuring stick. Instead of wondering why she didn't know fifty words, we celebrated when she knew twenty. Once we stopped worrying about what her peers were doing, we were able to enjoy watching her learn at her own pace. As soon as I stopped comparing and competing, I was able to see how beautiful and amazing it is to watch a little brain absorb and apply knowledge.\nEven now, Rudy communicates well but we have learned that she learns language very differently than most other children. Most of Rudy's speech comes from a vast repertoire of scripts that she modifies to suit different scenarios. It's incredible to watch and so different from the way Maude learns.\nWhile Maude was an infant, I worried terribly that I would compare the girls and I was terrified that I'd resent one of the girls if she were more advanced than her sister. As it turns out, I don't feel that way at all. The girls are so different and they each have their own talents and challenges. My job is to keep them safe and help them to become the best versions of themselves. I think that having a child that doesn't fit inside the box has allowed me to open my own mind.\nI think the beauty is that when you stop searching for the sparkle, you realize it's there. Just maybe not in the obvious ways you expected to see it.

{"id": "1219", "text": "The first thing to know about negotiation is that you can and should do it for any transaction more than $100 or so. If you can talk to a human, you can probably negotiate. The larger the deal, the more value you'll find in negotiation.\nYou won't find many transactions larger than your compensation at a new job. With minutes of work, you can earn thousands of dollars over a year. For many folks, negotiation can add tens of thousands of dollars to your annual salary. That's huge;\nNegotiation is a ritual and varies with culture. Because you develop apps, and don't sell things for a living, haggling might seem weird. Think of it like shaking hands or saying \"hi\" to your waiter. The waiter doesn't ask you to greet them -- you probably just do it. If you \"opt out\" of a socially-expected greeting, often negative things happen. You might not realize it, but your waiter may give you worse service, deliver your food late, or \"forget\" your requests. A salary negotiation runs similarly in that \"opting out\" usually has negative consequences -- even if you don't notice.\nThe purpose of the negotiation ritual is to arrive at an agreement that all parties are happy with. Think of it roughly as a binary search through compensation space. The employer starts with a low salary, and you ask for a higher one. You go back and forth, first targeting one term, and then the other. At some point, you hopefully find a deal that works for you both.\nI've spoken with many developers who believe that the employer should just offer a fair salary. In some cases, they will. But usually, they calculate their first offer anticipating your counter-offer. In other words, they give you the lowest offer that seems reasonable in the expectation you will ask for the highest offer you think is fair. If you accept the first offer, you'll end up with a deal that strongly favors the employer. The outcomes of the ritual aren't perfect, but ignoring them can lead to poor results.\nAccepting an employer's first offer can also seem strange to the employer. Like your waiter expects a greeting, a recruiter or manager expects negotiation. Not engaging in negotiation can seem unprofessional, and even worse, make you appear less experienced than they thought.\nSkipping negotiations can make you appear desperate or like you don't value your skills. Your new employer might think they got a bad deal because they wonder if they could have made you a lower offer. From the hiring manager's perspective, the only offer you wouldn't negotiate is one that seems incredibly high.\nKeep in mind that this is a short take on negotiation. Many books have been written on the subject, so don't take this as the final word. Also, note that negotiation varies by culture. I'm writing from the US perspective.\nWhile many negotiators focus on base salary, there are many other terms you can negotiate. At certain salary levels, the non-salary terms may become more critical. Here are some items that you might negotiate.\nAlthough it's illegal to ask in some cases, many recruiters want to know your current compensation. I've never revealed this to recruiters, and never will. There is no advantage to disclose what your current employer pays you, and sharing it will limit the outcome of your negotiation.\nEarly in my career, I was able to leave a job that paid about $60,000 for a job that paid nearly $80,000. A 30% jump in pay probably wouldn't have happened if I had revealed my current salary.\nAlong the same lines is, \"what are your salary expectations?\" Ideally, you don't want to reveal this number either. Whatever amount you name will immediately limit the outcome of your negotiations. If you say \"I'd like to make $160,000 a year\", chances are high that your initial offer will be somewhat less than that number. Assume that most negotiations end up in the middle of the range set by the first offer and any counter-offer.\nOne of the best ways to dodge the salary expectations question is to beat the recruiter to the punch. Ask the recruiter for the salary range before they ask you. \"So we don't waste each other's time, can you confirm the base salary range for this position?\"\nIf they balk, you can say what they would say to you in the same position: \"I need to know so we can make sure we're a good fit\" or \"I'd like to know so we don't waste each other's time.\" Whatever the answer, it can't hurt to ask: \"Do you have any flexibility on that?\" If your salary range and their range don't match, it's best to let them know now.\nAs a more experienced iOS developer (and negotiator), you may sometimes need to offer a number if the recruiter refuses to reveal their salary range. A compensation mismatch can waste days. I once spent days interviewing with a company before learning that their offer would be tens of thousands of dollars below my minimum needs. If this happens to you, I suggest presenting what negotiators call a \"high anchor.\" This means that you give them the highest legitimate salary range for someone with your skills. When you do this, make it clear that these numbers aren't yours -- they're what your research revealed. For example:\n\"I'm hesitant to share this because it sounds crazy. My research shows that some companies are paying iOS developers with my skills from $170,000 to $241,000 base salary and total compensation from $214,000 to $659,000 per year.\"\nNever offer compensation numbers without qualifying it as \"base salary\" or \"total compensation\" numbers. Many recruiters will optimistically assume that any large number is total compensation. Equity, vacation, and bonuses should be negotiated separately. Equity is an especially sticky piece of compensation to value. The stock might be worth nothing, or it might be worth millions. Don't let the recruiters confuse you by muddling base compensation (salary) with equity (stock).\nRecruiters never work for you. They will tell you that they win when you win, but that's not entirely true. Ultimately their duty is to their employer (or the company that contracted them). If you tell them that you'd like to earn $150,000, but would take $130,000, they will not keep it a secret. You will probably not receive an offer much higher than $130,000. The recruiter's incentive is always to close deals more than their commission or anything else.\nThis is related to not revealing your current or expected compensation since showing that information is similar to making an offer. If you say you expect to make $160,000, you're offering to work for $160,000.\nWhichever side makes the first offer basically sets the benchmark for their best possible outcome. If the company starts by offering you an $180,000 salary, it's unlikely they will be able to lower that number. On the other hand, if you offer to work for $180,000, you won't get an offer higher than that number.\nSome companies will try to persuade you to make the first offer because they \"don't want to offend you,\" or \"don't know what a fair offer is.\" I usually promise I won't be offended or explain that they probably have more data on the market rates than I do.\n\"Tell me what salary range you're thinking, and I'm sure we can work out something from there.\"\nEven if you receive a disappointing offer, it's essential to express that you'd like to reach an agreement. If your reaction isn't professional or optimistic, it reduces your chances of reaching an agreement. Instead of making another offer, they may decide to move on to the next candidate.\nI suggest tempering your optimism with a slightly negative initial reaction. I usually react to any offer with a \"Hmmm,\" \"Ooohh\" or another sound to indicate that I hoped for a better offer. I quickly move on with optimism that we can make a deal work, and asking for a better offer. If you respond with pure excitement, it won't match with your request for a better proposal. For example, this sounds crazy:\n\"We'd like to offer your $90,000.\"\n\"Yay!!! I'd like a higher salary.\"\nThe recruiter will get the impression that you'll accept the job no matter what.\nNegotiation in the US involves offers and counter-offers until both parties are satisfied with the deal. Most competent negotiators make an offer anticipating that you will have a counter-offer. In other words, they don't offer their highest number first. Even if your first offer is entirely satisfactory, you can probably ask for a better offer.\nDepending on your upbringing, you might feel awkward asking for a better offer. Some people find it greedy. You should understand that how you approach negotiation and the outcome of bargaining can influence the opinion of your future employers. It may not seem fair, but your salary will shape the opinion of the people you work for. If you negotiate an offer for a higher wage, their estimation of your value as an iOS developer will likely increase.\nThere are salary bands that correspond with each job title behind the scenes at larger companies with HR departments. A new college grad iOS developer might make $80,000 - $90,000. A junior developer might make $95,000 - $110,000. And so on. In some cases, the skill level you're assigned may literally depend on what salary you negotiate.\nRecently a recruiter argued a candidate should get a better job title to correspond to their higher salary expectation. Take this as proof that job titles there aren't based on skill or experience!\nI saw this when I followed a colleague from one company to another. Somehow I ended up with a better job title, even though we had similar levels of experience and the exact same job title at the previous job. I suspect this only happened because I negotiated a higher salary.\nNegotiating your job offer can have a surprising impact not just on your prosperity but also on your career development and how your peers view you.\nWhen you're applying for jobs, you need to know both what your skills are worth in general, and how they're compensated at the company you're interviewing at. Many companies explain their benefits on their web sites, and a tiny number even reveal their salaries. You can also find information on salary and compensation sites. You can find salary information for specific positions at specific companies. You can also find general salary information for jobs in various geographic regions.\nYou can also use your professional network to research salaries and compensation. Few people in the US will feel comfortable revealing their salaries when directly asked. Still, you can sometimes get an approximation by asking indirectly:\nNegotiations can intimidate and exhaust you. Many people talk too much and reveal too much information, especially when in an uncomfortable situation. For this reason, remaining silent is a vital skill in negotiations.\nSaying \"I'd need a higher salary,\" followed by thirty seconds of silence, is very different from saying the same thing followed with filler words. Continuing to speak after a request can paint you as lacking confidence, downplay your request, or deflect the conversation to another topic. I've seen folks who ask for more and then immediately explain that it's ok if they can't get it.\nAsking for something won't work unless you wait for a response. Unfortunately, silence is a known negotiation tactic, so a skilled negotiator may give you an extended opportunity to derail your request.\nPractice silence with a friend. Practice an entire negotiation. When you ask for a better offer, make a game of how long you can wait without speaking.\nThese are some ideas for how you might respond to everyday situations when negotiating a job offer. In all cases, I suggest honesty in your responses. I also recommend practicing these various situations with a friend so you can develop your own natural reactions.\nSometimes recruiters or hiring managers use time pressure to reduce your negotiating leverage. If you only have a few hours or a day to make a decision, you'll have less opportunity to get a competing offer. Or maybe they don't want you to notice some problem with the deal. Or perhaps they're just in a hurry.\nAccepting a job offer is a big deal. I would never accept an offer without having time to discuss it with my friends and family. iOS developers don't negotiate and cut deals for a living. Since recruiters negotiate all day, you should take some time and space to consider the offer and decide on your next move.\nSometimes the recruiter tells us a third party (e.g., the hiring manager or a director) is the only person who could do X, Y, or Z. Sometimes a third party has to be consulted; other times, this is a \"higher authority\" gambit, and the recruiter already has the power.

{"id": "1228", "text": "It's taken me two weeks to be able to sit down and write what I'm about to write. Two really hard weeks. We never think that we will be the ones to have to share the really hard things, but then the hard things happen to us, and we think, \"Oh yeah. God is writing this story, not me. And I need to tell it.\" I don't want these to be my words. I've been praying that they will be His words, and that the hard things will bring Him glory.\nTwo weeks ago, on a Saturday afternoon, we got a call from our agency that we were never expecting or hoping for. The girls that we fully believed were our daughters and haved loved and prayed over from afar for the last six+ months, will not be coming into our family. After some red flags were raised and our agency did some investigating, it was discovered that the orphanage director and chief of a particular village were running a scam. They had found children, told their families that they were finding them American families that they would go live with, send them to school, feed them, take good care of them, and then send them back to their actual families at some point. When the people that our agency hired went out to the village to talk to the families and explain to them that the kids were being put up for adoption and would not be coming back, this is not what the families wanted.\nSo, there it is in a nutshell. Jonathan and I were together without the boys when we got the call that day and I know that was not an accident. We were driving in pouring down rain, and I eventually pulled over to be able to hear what the lady from our agency was telling us. I wasn't sure how to even respond to what we were hearing. I had had a bad feeling for days, and now I knew why. We asked some questions with what sense we could muster up, but we mostly just listened, trying to process. I kept it together until after we got off the phone, and then after a quiet few minutes, totally lost it. Where I lost it the most, honestly, was at the thought of having to tell the boys. These boys believed that Lulah and Jovia were their sisters. They have prayed for them daily, they draw pictures of our family that include the girls in it, they have worked hard at helping us raise money to bring them home, they have loved them well. The thought of telling them that they would not be coming to live with us and the parts of the story that exposed the evil behind the whole thing- I just couldn't even stomach it at the time. I didn't want their faith that has grown so much during this two year journey to be shaken. I didn't want them to think that God was not answering our prayers. Because I knew in that moment, even through the sobs, that He was, and that our faith was going to be made even stronger through all of this. But I didn't know if they would see it that way. How could they? When we got to where we had been driving to, thankfully I knew no one there, except one sweet friend that has become so dear in a short time. She was the first person I saw when I walked through the doors, which again was not an accident, and I just fell apart. She hugged me tight and said some beautiful things, but the one thing that I will remember most and gave me so much encouragement was this:\n\"Think of all the people that have been praying over those girls that never would have been before. God is faithful and will answer those prayers. Maybe not in the way that hoped, but He will answer them. If the whole time we thought we were praying them into the Sheahen family, we were actually praying them back into their own families, then it was worth it.\" And yes, we absolutely know that it was worth it. All the heartbreak that we are feeling now, is worth it to expose what was going on and save these kids from being stolen from their families. As much as we wanted them, we would have never wanted to take them from their families that wanted them. We believe that is where they belong. Although the families situations may be desperate enough to believe such lies, they are families nonetheless, and they want them. Praise God for that.\nA few hours after finding all of this out, we went to the wedding of two people that we love dearly. We wanted to go and needed to go. Most everyone there were people that we don't see that often, so as you can imagine pretty much every single person asked us about when the girls were coming home. We absolutely know that everyone's questions were well intended, and we so appreciated everyone's interest and excitement, but boy, that was pretty torturous. We really were not ready to talk about it, and we deflected a lot of questions and I'm sure acted pretty weird at times. I'll go ahead and apologize to those who might be reading this that wondered why we seemed like we didn't have much to say about that subject, but now you know why.\nThe next day we told the boys, and they took it better than I expected. That's not to say they weren't sad and didn't quite understand, but I prayed that God would give us the right words to say to them to try to help explain it all, and I believe He did. We stressed that this doesn't mean that we will stop praying for them and we fully trust that God is going to take care of them. And we trust that He's got a greater plan for all of this that we just can't see right now, and He can take people's bad choices and evil intentions and use them for good. I think simplifying it like that was just what we needed.\nSo where do we go from here? We are pressing on. Not sure what that will look like, but moving forward with unwavering faith and hope in the promises of God. We have been grieving, with some days being harder than others. But, more than that, we are believing in a God that is bigger, trusting that He is working out everything for good and knowing that He will redeem this. He will use this broken mess and heartache and turn it into something beautiful. Let me just say that we absolutely believe that we were led to Lulah and Jovia for a reason. It was no accident that I found Lulah on that waiting child list, with the same name that we had picked out for our future daughter a year before. This outcome DOES NOT CHANGE THAT. Why, you might ask? I may not know the exact answer to that on this side of eternity, but I do know that I don't have to, and that because we have an eternal hope, we will know one day. Right now, we have faith that He will show us what our next steps will be.\nJust a few weeks after we started this adoption journey, we were able to hear Francis Chan speak at a Show Hope dinner, and his message centered around this one verse that I have \"adopted\" as our theme verse over the last two years. I didn't realize at the time how much it would come to mean to me.\n\"I pray that God, the source of HOPE, will fill you completely with joy and peace because you trust in Him. Then you will overflow with confident HOPE through the power of the Holy Spirit.\" Romans 15:13\nWould you like to guess what the message at church was about last Sunday morning?\n<<< HOPE >>>\nAnd then Sunday night, a different speaker at a different church, told us that he had been praying Romans 15:13 over us all week leading up to that service. Of course he had.\nIf we had an earthly perspective of hope, then what has happened would be devastating. When the world would ask why are we continuing on this journey after two years with nothing to show for it, we rejoice in the hope of God's glory. We move on knowing that in the end, He will get all the glory for this story. He is developing patience in us and He is strengthening our character, which is producing confident hope. Even when there is no reason for hope, we keep hoping. Like Abraham did, never once wavering in believing God's promises to him. In the face of insurmountable obstacles, Abraham believed. In fact, his faith grew stronger, and in this he brought glory to God. He was fully convinced that God is able to do whatever He promises. Hope was real to him, and so it is to us. Abraham's hope allowed him to see far and wide the innumerable amount of people that would come from that promised child. And this is what we see. Our flesh cries out, \"God, we can't get there from here! We can't keep this up much longer!\" And that's right, we can't, without Him. But we have to hope against human hope; a hope that springs from God's perspective. The belief that God will do what He has promised. God WILL DO what He has promised.\nWhat you can do for us is continue to pray. Pray for those precious girls that you have already been praying so hard for. Don't stop. We're not sure of exactly what is going on in their lives, but we know that God does, and He hears our prayers for them. Pray for Jesus to be in their hearts and evident in their lives. We may never know here the impact our fervent prayers will have on their lives and what kind of forces for the kingdom they might turn out to be, but we trust in a God that has already written their story, and we are honored to be a part of it. Pray for our family, that we will continue to follow Him wherever He leads us, no matter what. We are still 100% planning to adopt children who actually need a family. And we still feel strongly that those children are in Uganda, and that is where we are staying for now. Although part of me feels strange to be moving forward when our emotions are so raw, the other part of me knows that the door on adopting Lulah and Jovia has closed and moving forward is the only thing we can do. Pray for our boys and their tender hearts. Pray that this will only make their faith bigger, their trust stronger and their hope more confident. And pray for those who intended all of this for evil. Pray for their hearts to know the peace and joy and confident hope that only Jesus can bring. Because He not only died for us, and for Lulah and Jovia, but He died for them too. And praise God for that.", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

A few years after UN began its operations, it established the International Maritime Organization (IMO) in 1948 to provide a means of cooperation among Governments relating governmental regulation and practices on all kinds of technical matters affecting shipping engaged in international trade; encouraging and facilitating the general adoption of the highest practicable standards in matters concerning maritime safety, efficiency of navigation as well as prevention and control of marine pollution from ships[i].\nThe prevention and control of marine pollution from ships such as addressing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from ships has been undertaken by the IMO since 1997, where during the Conference of Parties to MARPOL 73/78 (the Air Pollution Conference), IMO has adopted a new Annex VI - Regulations for the Prevention of Air Pollution from Ships - to the Convention in order to reduce the contribution by shipping to air pollution[ii].\nThe work to develop legally binding measures to reduce air pollution from ships was an invitation in accordance to Article 212 of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, 1982 (UNCLOS), resolution A.719(17). As a result, IMO made a decision to include the regulation on energy efficiency for ships in the MARPOL Annex VI where it stipulates the requirements on the Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI) and the Ship Energy Efficiency Management Plan (SEEMP). This regulation came into force in 2013[iii].\nBy 2015, many countries had agreed to work together to limit global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius and aim for 1.5 degrees Celsius, to adapt to the impacts of changing climate and to provide budget to achieve the target[iv]. Thus, the Paris Agreement was born, and was adopted by 196 parties at the COP21 in Paris. The Paris Agreement also provides a framework for financial, technical and capacity building support to countries that in need of it. Today, we are witnessing some great progress taken by countries, regions, cities and companies throughout the globe to achieve the promised target.\n2. Works on Emission Reduction From International Shipping\nThe International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL), as amended, plays a huge role because it was the first legally binding climate change instrument since the Kyoto Protocol for international shipping. While the Paris Agreement does not include international shipping, but since IMO is the regulatory body for the shipping industry, it is committed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from international shipping. So, on 13th April 2018, IMO adopted Resolution MEPC.304(72) which is the initial IMO strategy on reduction of GHG emissions from ship, and committed to reduce at least 50% of GHG emission from international shipping by 2050 compare to 2008.\nSince the adoption of the Initial GHG Strategy, in order to support their implementation, the IMO has approved a number of programs for short-term GHG reduction measures. These programs includes:\nadoption of MEPC resolution to invite Member States to encourage voluntary cooperation between the port and shipping sectors to contribute to reducing GHG emissions from ships (resolution MEPC.323(74));\napproval of the Procedure for assessing impacts on States of candidate measures (MEPC.1/Circ.885);\nfurther improvement of the existing energy efficiency framework with a focus on EEDI and SEEMP, in particular by adoption of the amendments to MARPOL Annex VI on the early application of the EEDI Phase 3 requirements for certain ship types, which will enter into force in April 2022 (resolution MEPC.324(75));\nadoption of the MEPC resolution on encouragement of Member States to develop and submit voluntary national action plan to address GHG emissions from ships (resolution MEPC.327(75)) - see submitted national action plans here;\nadoption by MEPC 76 of amendments to MARPOL Annex VI on the short-term goal-based carbon intensity reduction measure setting out technical and operational energy efficiency measures for ships (EEXI and CII); together with approval of a comprehensive impact assessment;\ncommissioning, oversight and approval of the Fourth IMO GHG Study 2020;\ninitial development of life cycle GHG assessment guidelines by the Intersessional Working Group on Reduction of GHG Emissions from Ships (ISWG-GHG) – read more here;\ninitial consideration of other candidate measures listed in the Initial Strategy, including proposal for the establishment of an International Maritime Research Board to coordinate and oversee R&D efforts; and\ncontinued and enhanced technical cooperation and capacity-building activities, including the establishment of a voluntary multi-donor trust fund to sustain the Organization's technical cooperation and capacity-building activities to support the implementation of the Initial Strategy (\"GHG-TC Trust Fund\").\nThe recent updates on GHG emission reduction were made at the MEPC 78 which was held remotely from 6 to 10 June 2022. In brief, the outcomes of the meeting under the GHG emission reduction from ships was: a) the finalisation of technical guidelines for the upcoming Energy Efficiency Design Index for existing ships (EEXI), Carbon Intensity Indicator (CII) and Ship Energy Efficiency Management Plan (SEEMP) regulations which will come into force in 2023; b) the approval of a proposal for Mediterranean Sea as a sulphur emission control area (SECA); and c) further discussions on the revision of the IMO GHG Strategy which has been scheduled for 2023.\nApart from the above, there was also an extensive discussion on potential mid and long-term measures during the intersessional meeting held two weeks prior to MEPC 78. The mid and long-term proposals for various market-based measures are:\na levy system based on absolute well-to-wake GHG emissions;\na levy system based on CII performance;\na levy system based on absolute tank-to-wake CO2 emissions; and\nan emissions cap-and-trade system, which is similar to the European Union Emissions Trading System (EU ETS).\nDiscussion on these market-based measures proposals will continue during the intersessional meeting prior to MEPC 79. The proposed market-based measures which are the levy system and the Cap-and-trade system were intended to accelerate the reduction of the total annual greenhouse gas emissions by at least 50 per cent by 2050.\nAs reported by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) in its annual 2021 report, over the last decade, shipping has become more energy efficient, so the total emissions have grown slower as compared to the total number of vessels. However, the report did emphasise that the improvement will not suffice to meet the emission targets and the agreed objectives of the IMO.\nTo accelerate the GHG emission reduction, the United Kingdom had announced £206 million to establish UK Shipping Office for Reducing Emissions, or UK SHORE[v]. This is a world-leading initiative showcasing climate leadership and to decarbonising maritime, fulfilling the UK’s COP26 commitment. The example shown by the UK government, is definitely amazing where having a governmental firm support through policies and incentives are crucial in facilitating the journey towards net-zero shipping.\n3. Shipping in Southeast Asia\nSoutheast Asia is blessed with a strategic location that sees high trading and shipping activities throughout the whole year. In 2017, DNV.GL reported about 29,630 ocean-going ships had operations in, or transit through, the ASEAN region, consuming about 35.1 million ton of oil equivalents. In the same report, it presents an overview of emissions by ship types for the ASEAN region, and the key finding is CO2 emissions are found to be 111.9 million tonnes, representing about 14% of the global ship emissions. The emissions of NOx and SOx are 2,320 and 1,730 Kton, respectively; where else the emissions of PM10 and PM2.5 are 214 and 194 Kton, respectively.\nThe number of ships reporting to the Mandatory ship Reporting System in the Straits of Malacca and Singapore (STRAITREP)[vi] from 2017 until 2021, as reported by the Marine Department of Malaysia, is decreasing year after year, it became worse during the COVID19 pandemic. In 2021 alone, the number of ships reporting to STRAITREP was only 78,317 ships, down by -7.84% as compared to 2017. The downtrend pattern of ship reporting to STRAITREP probably provides a positive indication should we were to look at it from the environmental point of view, since less shipping activities will result in less fuel consumption, which leads to lower air pollution. However, less shipping activities in the region could also bring a negative impact on the economics of a country. In Malaysia for example, it was found that less shipping activities as indirectly causes an increase in the cost of living[vii].\n4. Southeast Asia Policy on Emission from Ship\nThe regional cooperation in Southeast Asia began in 1967 when five leaders of Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand gathered in Bangkok, Thailand and signed a document. By virtue of that document, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) was born[viii]. Today, the ASEAN member states consist of Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao PDR, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.\nUp until 2021, only Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, and Vietnam have ratified MARPOL Annex VI, which means, half of ASEAN member states have yet to ratify the Convention. To understand further on ASEAN policy on GHG emission from ships, observations were conducted on the documents produced by ASEAN, such as;\nASEAN Community Vision 2025;\nASEAN Plan of action for energy cooperation (APAEC) 2016-2025;\nASEAN Economic community Blueprint 2025;\nASEAN Political Security Community Blueprint 2025; and\nASEAN Socio Cultural Community Blueprint 2025;\nFrom the observations made to the documents above, the ASEAN Transport Strategic Plan, also called the Kuala Lumpur Transport Strategic Plan (KLTSP), which has the element of Sustainable Transport and GHG emission from transport sector, was developed with aims to support the realisation of the vision of the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) 2025. The vision calls for a deeply integrated region that will contribute towards a highly cohesive ASEAN economy[ix]. In this regard, the Kuala Lumpur Transport Strategic Plan (KLTSP), which serves as a guiding regional policy document, outlines 30 specific goals, 78 actions and 221 milestones in the areas of air transport, land transport, maritime transport, sustainable transport and transport facilitation but it does not specify policy on GHG emissions reduction from shipping.\nIn the case of Malaysia and as a member to ASEAN, the design of Malaysia National Transport Policy is very much influenced by the ASEAN Transport Strategic Plan. The Ministry of Transport (MOT) Malaysia has collaborated with various members of government, academia and private sector through series of focus group discussions, technical meetings and workshops since September 2016 to produce the National Transport Policy (NTP) covering land, air dan water transport and is anchored on the principle of sustainable transport. Again, the policy on GHG emission reduction from shipping was not emphasised.\nAcknowledging that there is a gap in the policy, and a need for additional standards and regulations relating to environmental protection in the maritime transport sector, Malaysia, as a party to UNCLOS, is obliged to perform its duty as a flag state, port state & coastal state. Malaysia being a member state to the IMO, is also committed to supports IMO commitment in reducing GHG emission from shipping. To do so, Malaysia participated in the Green Voyage project in 2021 and currently undertaking legal and policies reforms towards effective implementation of MARPOL Annex VI as well as developing its own National Action Plan (NAPs).\nThe emissions from ships have been slower over the years compared to the number of ships, however, as reported by UNCTAD 2021 the current work is not sufficient to meet the IMO-agreed target of reducing emissions from international shipping by at least 50% by 2050 compared to 2008. Individual countries, especially the developing countries in ASEAN are encouraged to accelerate the emissions reduction from ship by ways of domestic legislation, policies or participating in an international project such as GreenVoyage2050, hence, it is strongly recommended that all ASEAN members to ratify MARPOL Annex VI.\nCooperation between countries in the same region is feasible to accelerate the reduction of emissions from ships. The Regional Cooperation among the Countries of Southeast Asia are therefore requested; a) to develop a policy on emission reduction from shipping; b) to develop a Regional Action Plan to achieve net-zero shipping; and c) to protect the well-being of the people in Southeast Asia, whom are affected by the air pollution from ship in-line with the ASEAN join statement on climate change to the UNFCCC COP26.\n[i] https://www.imo.org/en/About/HistoryOfIMO/Pages/Default.aspx.

{"id": "1232", "text": "Concert of Indo-Pacific: An Option for Peace and Order in the East Asian Seas\nSuggestions for lasting peace in the South China Sea and beyond need to incorporate small and medium states as well.\nRecently, Dr. Hu Bo from Peking University contributed an op-ed to The Diplomat titled “3 Keys to a Peaceful China-US Maritime Coexistence.” He called on the United States and China to build a new balance of power in the western Pacific with three policy recommendations for the two countries to: (i) reach a necessary consensus on power distribution in the western Pacific, (ii) rationally handle third-party factors, and (iii) make joint efforts to build inclusive maritime rules and order. These proposals seem to reflect the view held by many other Chinese elites about the current world and how it should be changed. And this view is worrying, if not alarming, to me.\nDr. Hu is right to observe the intensifying strategic competition between the United States and China in the maritime domain. But his approach reflects the 19th century perspective when power politics were the mainstream and big powers enjoyed the rights to (i) divide the world into spheres of influence based on power distribution, (ii) work on rules to govern relations between themselves, again based on power distribution, and “rationally handle third-party factors,” and (iii) persuade or force other countries to accept such rules and order. His recommendations may sound interesting from big powers’ perspective, but sounds dangerous to smaller states whose interests are compromised by big powers’ politics, as history has shown.\nOn the first point, Dr. Hu tried to persuade the United States to replace the current multi-power-centered structure with a G-2 configuration in the western Pacific. This proposal clearly disregards and downplays the roles, influence, and interests of other major players in the region such as ASEAN members, Japan, Australia, the EU, India, South Korea, New Zealand, Russia, and some Western countries including the U.K., Germany, France, and Canada. Those powers have high stakes in the region in terms of freedom of navigation and overflight, unimpeded maritime trade, strategic interests, and so on. In one way or another, they have been playing an important role in maintaining peace, stability, and the international liberal rules-based order across the region.\nAny G-2 model would also bypass ASEAN, a group of 10 Southeast Asian nations that have high stakes in their immediate maritime neighborhood, and sideline the ASEAN-led security arrangements, which host dialogues and cooperative mechanisms to promote confidence-building, preventive diplomacy, and conflict resolution in the region.\nSecond, Dr. Hu implicitly suggests that the United States should be content with the new power distribution and work on a deal with China. Along that line, Washington should keep a low profile on sovereignty and related issues, restrain itself from intervening into regional maritime affairs, and not heed calls from the small and medium states concerned. In fact, Washington has always been neutral on the territorial sovereignty issue, and no one country is urging the U.S. to interfere in the region. The United States has been in the region for a long time, and its engagement is based on its national interests in terms of freedom of the seas and overflight as well as upholding international rules and norms. More importantly, the United States, alongside other major powers, has paid more attention to the region recently because they are alarmed by Chinese gunboat diplomacy and coercion through “grey zone” tactics. Beijing subtly leverages its physical strength to change the status quo on the ground at the expense of other states in the region, including the United States.\nThird, Dr. Hu audaciously suggests that the United States “cooperate calmly” with China to rewrite the maritime rules. It seems likely that the author intended to redirect the debate over the South China Sea away from the current focus on the legality of claims and actions at sea. His proposal essentially calls to establish a “gentlemen’s agreement” that might be used as a proof of American agreement with China – allowing Beijing to sidestep the 2016 arbitral tribunal award, and to revise the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea 1982 (UNCLOS) in China’s favor. It is fair to say that UNCLOS is a package deal, which was carefully drafted and adopted based on a delicate balance of the interests, rights, and duties of coastal states, noncoastal states, and the international community. So it is not up to the United States and China alone to change it, but requires specific procedures and consensus from all parties, with the logics and process being different from those of power politics.\nIt is natural to expect the United States and China to play a leading role in building a sustainable security architecture in the Indo-Pacific. However, it is inappropriate to look at the issue from the lens of 19th century great power politics, which aimed to divide the world into spheres of influence at the expense of other states’ interests. The following are several take-away counterproposals.\nFirst, the United States and China should seriously take into account other states’ positions and interests. They should participate constructively in ASEAN-led arrangements while working together to improve regional and global multilateral mechanisms/institutions for effectively coping with transnational and cross-cutting challenges, for example the COVID-19 pandemic. They should also work together to maintain order at sea based on international laws and norms, particularly UNCLOS. The great powers should not use physical might to coerce and intimidate the weaker ones, but wield influence in a healthy manner.\nSecond, the United States and China should steer away from the power-based structure and promote a trust-based one. At the end of the day, the support of the wider international community matters. When big powers seek to maximize power through bolstering military might and flexing muscle, fear and suspicion will widely spread in the region. Other states will worry about being drawn into the “clash of the titans” and having to take side. The big powers, therefore, need to engage in deeper confidence-building measures so as to build trust — not only between themselves, but also in the rest of the region.\nThird and accordingly, the two powers should refrain from unlawful military activities in the East Asian maritime domains and turn them into seas of peace and cooperation. China should exercise self-restraint and stop militarization, coercion, and intimidation in order to create a conducive environment for continuing Code of Conduct negotiations in good faith. Confidence-building measures should be promoted with cooperation on nonsensitive issues in accordance with international law, including UNCLOS.\nIf the East Asian seas continue to be stirred up by “might-makes-right” behavior, the proposal for shedding a position of neutrality will gain more prominence. International efforts to support the Southeast Asian littoral states will be beefed up to help them defend their sovereignty and legitimate maritime entitlements. International law and the maritime order should be upheld as everyone has an interest in navigating freely and safely through the East Asian seas. Therefore, any attempt to reverse history back to rude power-based politics would soon hit a wall.\nThuc D. Pham is a researcher at the Diplomatic Academy of Vietnam.

{"id": "1235", "text": "Welcome to the third and final (and lengthiest!) part of my laundry room renovation! This is the fun post where I share all the little details that made the room come together so well! Be sure to catch Part 1 and Part 2 if you haven't already. 😉\nWhere to begin?\nI started with a Pinterest board for my laundry room reno, which you can see below. This was where all of my ideas came together to create the overall vibe and aesthetic for the laundry room.\nThe pin that was my main inspiration was this one from farmhousejourney on Instagram, with a few modifications to personalize it to my preferences:\nFor starters, we painted the walls Repose Gray. This is the same color as the rest of the house (with the exception of the bathrooms and bedrooms).\nWe purchased two 15\" x 30\" cabinets from Lowe's to hang in the corners above the washer and dryer. I wanted concealed storage to help make everything look clean and uncluttered.\nI painted the cabinets Icing on the Cake by Benjamin Moore. I wanted a super light turquoise that wouldn't fight against the gray walls. The room would need a tiny bit of color, and I think this was exactly what it needed! I was a bit nervous buying paint based solely on the color displayed on my computer screen, but since I refuse to go out shopping, I just kept my fingers crossed that this would work. And it did! YAY!\nI wanted an accent wall behind the washer and dryer, so I went with this peel and stick one from Lowe's. It was a breeze to install and looks great!\nThe cheap-o contractor-grade light fixture was also on my list to replace. See how awful it was before? And how much better it looked after?\nI absolutely loved the industrial matte black fixture from Lowe's, and it was perfect for the room. It really brightened everything up quite nicely and fit the overall vibe I was going for.\nAs you may have discovered in Part 2 of my laundry room reno, I selected Whirlpool's smart capable 5.3 cu. ft. high efficiency top-load washer and Whirlpool's smart capable 8.8 cu. ft. steam cycle electric dryer, both in chrome shadow. There are TWO main reasons I chose these beauties:\n- Smart Capable. In other words, I now have an app on my iPhone that allows me to control my appliances. I love technology, and it was a no-brainer that I'd want this functionality in my new washer and dryer. I get notifications when both finish their cycles, I can restart the dryer with a quick tap, and even assign tasks (via automated text messages) to request hubs or LO move or fold the load. It's brilliant and my life will never be the same!\n- Load and Go Dispenser. Because I'm SUPER\nLAZYEFFICIENT, I wanted my washer to be efficient, too. This incredible dispenser allows me to add enough detergent for 20 loads of laundry at one time, and it automatically dispenses the correct amount for each load. MAJOR WIN!\nThe boys are fascinated by the newest additions to the family! They love that they can watch the washer through the window on top.\nAnd of course there's a window to watch the dryer... AND A LIGHT! How fun is that?\nNow for my MOST FAVORITE FEATURES in the laundry room (minus the incredible new appliances, of course): NEW SHELVES!\nFirst up? This custom shelf and hanging rack!\nI was So.Very.Tired. of the awful white plastic-coated wire shelves in the laundry room. They were ugly, difficult to clean, and things were constantly falling through them. The height wasn't my favorite, either.\nTo go with the industrial vibe of my reno, hubs and I bought 2\" x 12\" by 12' boards. We planned to put one on the wall with the hanging rack, and one over the washer and dryer.\nI stained the boards with Minwax oil-based stain in Aged Barrel.\nThen I bought a zillion pieces of galvanized pipe fittings, flanges, elbows, and more to create a hanging rack attached\nI didn't like the galvanized finish of the pipes, and wanted the hanging rack to match the appliances as much as possible. So I picked up Rust-Oleum Flat Metallic spray paint in Antique Nickel and painted all of the pieces before assembling them and attaching them to the wall and shelf.\nWe wanted the shelf about 12\" from the ceiling, and the pipe was about 4\" below then shelf. I absolutely LOVE this shelf and the ton of space the rack provides for our hanging clothes!\nI love how it matches my second favorite shelf -- the one above the washer and dryer!\nMy final favorite shelf is the awesome drop-down shelf! If you remember from my \"before\" pics, we used to have a shelf for folding clothes attached to the wall with chains. It could fold up and out of the way when needed. It was functional, but not the prettiest thing ever.\nWe knew we'd still need space to fold all.the.clothes. when the reno was complete, but we knew there had to be a better way! Hubs found these awesome folding shelf brackets on Amazon, and they were the perfect solution!\nI used the same shelf as before, but decided to cover it with the peel and stick wallpaper I used on the accent wall behind the washer and dryer. I think it looks super cute and love that it stores out of the way when not needed.\nSee how perfectly it shows up when needed? I just love it so much!\nHere are a few links to some of the other fun finds from my new laundry room!\nLamb's Ear Wreath\nLaundry Co. Metal Sign\nRectangle Serving Tray (to store all the fun pocket finds during laundry day) 😉\nlint bin and attached it on the right side of the dryer for quick and easy disposal of lint!\nEndless Love and Laundry Sign (I stained the frame to match the shelves)\nWHEW! This was a crazy-long post! Kudos to those of you who made it this far! I hope you enjoyed this glimpse into my beautiful new laundry room!", "scores": {"score": 0, "score_transform_1": 0, "score_transform_2": 0, "score_transform_3": 1}}

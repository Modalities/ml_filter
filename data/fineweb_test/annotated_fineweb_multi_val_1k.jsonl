{"id": "30", "text": "Report: APTs Adopting New Phishing Methods to Drop PayloadHackers Using Rich Text Format Template Injection to Bypass Anti-Malware\nMultiple APT groups from Russia, China, and India are adopting a new phishing attack technique, using Rich Text Format, or RTF, template injection, which makes their attacks harder to detect and stop, researchers warn.\nRTF template injection is a technique in which an RTF file containing decoy content can be altered to allow for the retrieval of content hosted at an external URL upon opening an RTF file. The template is compatible with Microsoft Office, which makes it easier for a user to open or edit these documents, giving attackers an opportunity to attack any system.\nProofpoint researchers first observed the increasing adoption of RTF template injection from February 2021 through April 2021, but the researchers say this technique was first seen as early as January 2021.\nThe Proofpoint threat researchers assess with moderate confidence that this novel technique could be adopted by other financially motivated cybercriminals.\n\"This technique, referred to as RTF template injection, leverages the legitimate RTF template functionality. It subverts the plain text document formatting properties of an RTF file and allows the retrieval of a URL resource instead of a file resource via an RTF’s template control word capability,\" says Michael Raggi, senior threat research engineer at Proofpoint.\nThe process enables an adversary to replace a file destination with a URL from which a remote payload may be retrieved. In the next stage, the retrieved payload can be loaded into an application or steal Windows credentials. The researchers say that since the payload is not in the document but in a shared URL, an antivirus will scan the RTF file and mark it safe, even though the URL is malicious.\nThe researchers say that a malicious payload can be retrieved using .doc.rtf file, which is an extension that specifies an RTF file will be opened with Microsoft Word.\n\"When an RTF Remote Template Injection file is opened using Microsoft Word, the application will retrieve the resource from the specified URL before proceeding to display the lure content of the file. This technique is successful despite the inserted URL not being a valid document template file,\" Raggi says.\nResearchers demonstrated a process in which the RTF file was weaponized to retrieve the documentation page for RTF version from a URL at the time the file is opened.\n\"The technique is also valid in the .rtf file extension format, however a message is displayed when opened in Word which indicates that the content of the specified URL is being downloaded and in some instances an error message is displayed in which the application specifies that an invalid document template was utilized prior to then displaying the lure content within the file,\" Raggi says.\nThe weaponization part of the RTF file is made possible by creating or altering an existing RTF file’s document property bytes using a hex editor, which is a computer program that allows for manipulation of the fundamental binary data.\n\"This technique does not require the use of a word processor application for the injection of the RTF remote template URL into the file,\" the researchers say.\n“Nation-state groups tend to innovate first with new attack vector variations and this would seem to be the case in this example,\" says Jason Steer, principal security strategist at threat intelligence company Recorded Future. He says the attack vectors have a short shelf life, which makes it difficult for the infosec community to learn about them.\nSteer also says other problems exists: Not enough vendors can work and play together well and the security industry is terrible at sharing intelligence, which he says is the best way to enable security tools to be more effective at identifying these risks as they emerge.\nTimeline of RTF Template Adoption\nThe researchers identified two distinct APT groups associated with the state interests of India and China that adopted RTF template injection earlier this year. Russian use of the technique has also been observed.\nProofpoint researchers attribute these template injection RTF files to the APT group DoNot Team, which is suspected of being aligned with Indian-state interests, identified through July 8, 2021. The researchers also identified a Chinese-related APT actor likely using RTF files to target entities with ties to Malaysian deep water energy exploration as recently as Sept. 29, 2021 (see: Chinese APT Group Reportedly Develops Custom Backdoor).\n\"Following this initial adoption period, the APT actor Gamaredon, which has been linked to the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) was later observed utilizing RTF template injection files in campaigns that leveraged Ukrainian governmental file lures on Oct. 5, 2021,\" the researchers say.\nIn June 2021, Check Point researchers uncovered an ongoing campaign by a Chinese advanced persistent threat group that had spent the last three years testing and refining a custom backdoor in its arsenal to conduct espionage campaigns targeting governments in Southeast Asia.\nDuring the investigation, researchers found that the campaign starts with a spear-phishing email containing malicious DOCX documents, which is sent to different employees of a government entity in Southeast Asia.\nThe document delivers an RTF file that is weaponized with what Check Point calls the RoyalRoad exploit builder, which takes advantage of users who have failed to patch older vulnerabilities in Microsoft Word’s Equation Editor.\nExpect RTF Use to Continue\n\"We would expect to see this sophisticated attack appearing more widely in 2022 as the technique trickles down to cybercriminals and, as phishing will still be the main attack vector, the importance of regular and up-to-date anti-phishing awareness and simulation training becomes ever more important,\" says Alan Calder of GRC International Group, a provider of IT governance, risk management and compliance solutions.\n\"The moral of the story is that adversaries will continue to evolve or modify their tactics and that your anti-malware solution will ultimately fall short of providing confidence that at any given moment a user, asset or workload has not been compromised,\" says Tim Wade, technical director, CTO team at cybersecurity company Vectra AI.\n\"Managing this inevitable compromise with visibility, detection and response is the hallmark of modern enterprise security programs resilient to motivated adversaries, and their legacy peers that continue to struggle with the disruption of a successful attack,\" Wade says.\n\"Weaponized documents that require enabling downloads or other connections to external content aren't new. In this case, the methods used by attackers are novel because they can hide malicious URLs through the use of Rich Text Format's capabilities, either by embedding raw text or through the use of Unicode and other means,\" says Sean Nikkel, senior cyberthreat intel analyst at digital risk protection solutions provider Digital Shadows.\nNikkel says users should be wary of opening documents that require downloads of templates or other data from the internet, especially from unknown users. Organizations may want to restrict file types such as RTF, strip inbound emails of attachments, or use a sandbox to test them for malicious activity.", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}

{"id": "77", "text": "A bob cut or bob is a short haircut for women (and occasionally men) in which the hair is typically cut straight around the head at about jaw-level, often with a fringe(or “bangs”) at the front. The bob is cut at the level of ears, below the ears or above shoulders.\nHistorically, women in the West have usually worn their hair long. Although young girls, actresses and a few “advanced” or fashionable women had worn short hair even before World War I—for example in 1910 the French actress Polaire is described as having “a shock of short, dark hair”, a cut she adopted in the early 1890s—the style was not considered generally respectable until given impetus by the inconvenience of long hair to girls engaged in war work. English society beauty Lady Diana Cooper, who had had bobbed hair as a child, kept the style through her teenage years and continued in 1914 as an adult. Renowned dancer and fashion trendsetter Irene Castle introduced her “Castle bob” to a receptive American audience in 1915, and by 1920 the style was rapidly becoming fashionable. Popularized by film star Mary Thurman in the early 1920s and by Colleen Moore and Louise Brooks in the mid to late 1920s, it was still seen as a somewhat shocking statement of independence in young women known as flappers, as older people were used to seeing girls wearing long dresses and heavy Edwardian-style hair. Hairdressers, whose training was mainly in arranging and curling long hair, were slow to realise that short styles for women had arrived to stay, and so barbers in many cities found lines of women outside their shops, waiting to be shorn of hair that had taken many years to grow.\nAlthough as early as 1922 the fashion correspondent of The Times was suggesting that bobbed hair was passé, by the mid-1920s the style (in various versions, often worn with a side-parting, curled or waved, and with the hair at the nape of the neck “shingled” short), was the dominant female hairstyle in the Western world. The style was spreading even beyond the West, as women who rejected traditional roles adopted the bob cut as a sign of modernity. Close-fitting cloche hats had also become very popular, and couldn’t be worn with long hair. Well-known bob-wearers were actresses Clara Bow and Joan Crawford, as well as Dutch film star Truus van Aalten.\nAs the 1930s approached, women started to grow their hair longer, and the sharp lines of the bob were abandoned.\n1960s and beyond\nIn the mid 1960s, Vidal Sassoon made it popular again, using the shape of the early bob and making it more stylish in a simpler cut. Its resurgence coincided with the arrival of the “mop top” Beatle cut for men. Those associated with the bob at that time included the fashion designers Mary Quant and Jean Muir, actresses Nancy Kwan, Carolyn Jones, Barbara Feldon and Amanda Barrie, and singers as diverse as Keely Smith, Cilla Black, Billie Davis, Juliette Gréco, Mireille Mathieu and Beverly Bivens of the American group We Five. It was also popular with African-Americans in the mid-to-late 1960s, reflected in groups including Diana Ross & The Supremes and The Marvelettes. Many styles and combinations of the “bob” have evolved since. In the late 1980s, Siouxsie Sioux, lead singer of Siouxsie and the Banshees, and Corinne Drewery, singer of Swing Out Sister, had bob cuts for a short time. Singer Linda Ronstadt sported a very “Louise Brooks” inspired bob on the cover of two Grammy award winning albums in the late 1980s. 1987’s Trio album with Dolly Parton and Emmylou Harris and her 1989 release Cry Like A Rainstorm, Howl Like The Wind. She also wears the cut in the video for her duet with James Ingram, Somewhere Out There. Anna Wintour, editor-in-chief of American Vogue since 1988, apparently had hers trimmed every day (Times 2, 10 July 2006). In the early 1990s Cyndi Lauper had a bob haircut with very unusual colors; soon afterwards, the cut became identified with Uma Thurman‘s character of Mia Wallace in Quentin Tarantino‘s 1994 film Pulp Fiction. In the mid to late 1990s, T-Boz of TLC also had a bob haircut with very unusual colors that was asymmetrical with bangs. Also, for the first two seasons and the first two episodes of the third season of Lois and Clark: The New Adventures of Superman, the character of Lois Lane (Teri Hatcher) had a trademark bob haircut. Also, in Barry Sonnenfeld‘s 1997 film Men in Black, the character of Dr. Laurel Weaver (Linda Fiorentino) also sported a bob.\nIn November 2005, Canadian ice dancer Kristina Lenko was asked to join ITV1‘s new series, Dancing on Ice. She went to her stylist in Toronto and told him “Do whatever you like.” He cut Lenko’s waist length hair into what is referred to as an A-line bob, where the hairs shorter in the back and gradually longer toward the front, with the longest pieces toward the front of the face. Later, ex–Spice Girl Victoria Beckham decided to cut her own hair into such a style, helping to raise its popularity worldwide with girls asking hairdressers for a “Pob”—Beckham’s nickname Posh Spice conflated with “bob”.\nIn 2007, R&B singer Rihanna had a bob haircut in the video for “Umbrella“. She has stated that she got her inspiration from Charlize Theron in Æon Flux. Keira Knightley had a bob in her short TV ad for Coco Mademoiselle. Actress Christina Ricci also had a bob for live-action movie version for 60s anime series Speed Racer and later onwards. Katie Holmes got a bob cut with bangs in 2007.\nAt her third show in Brisbane, Australia, Britney Spears wore the bob throughout her concert. Jenny McCarthy is known for a sporting an A-line bob. Kate Bosworth is said to have popularized the bob in 2008. Shoulder-length bobs became popular after being sported by stars such as Heidi Klum and Jessica Alba. A shaggy version of the bob was popularized by Dianna Agron and Rooney Mara.\n- A-line bob: A typical bob cut, with slightly longer hair in front that frames the face, typically curling under the chin.\n- Buzz-cut bob: Where it is shoulder-length in the front and close-cropped at the back.\n- Chin-length bob: Cut straight to the chin, with or without bangs.\n- Inverted bob: Similar to an A-line bob, but with stacked layers in the back. The perimeter of the cut is curved rather than being a straight line. This cut is also commonly called a “graduated bob”.\n- Shaggy bob: A messy bob layered with a razor.\n- Shingle bob: a cut that is tapered very short in the back, exposing the hairline at the neck. The hair on the sides is formed into a single curl or point on each cheek.\n- Shoulder-length bob: A blunt bob that reaches the shoulders and has very few layers.\nHistory from Wikipedia.", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}
{"id": "103", "text": "Adapting to Virtual Learning: Live with Rouben Mohiuddin\nUpdated: Apr 15, 2021\nWelcome back everyone, another week has gone by and it is nice to finally feel fall in the air! Last week in my blog and podcast I announced that after many years, I achieved my goal of becoming a licensed architect by 30. I am finally a licensed architect!\nI am ecstatic to bring on the first guest of Design Create Inspire, an individual I admire and am grateful to have learned from in the beginning of my architecture career, Rouben Mohiuddin.\nTo introduce Rouben, I will refer to his bio:\nRouben Mohiuddin was born in Bangladesh on March 6th, 1973. At the mere age of three, his father took him on a 17-year journey to North Africa, Asia and Europe. This journey instilled in him with a bounty of diversity, which influenced what would become a lifelong appreciation for Art, Architecture and Design. He pursued an undergraduate degree in Architecture and Environmental Design (1995) and has a Masters of Architecture degree from the Southern California Institute of Architecture (1997). His architectural education was a trans-disciplinary education that integrated the arts, sciences, and the humanities through creative and analytical thinking and development.\nRouben started his design career at select firms in Los Angeles and New York, specializing in custom residential projects and products. In 2002 he established Design SI. Although endlessly driven by the practice of design, he has always been inspired by the notion of ‘giving back’ through pro-bono community projects and has served as an educator at the University of California Los Angeles, Otis School of Art and Design, New York School of Interior Design, The Art Institute of California, and currently as Assistant Professor of Interior Architecture at California State University - Chico.\nRouben enjoys fly-fishing, the outdoors and urban forestry. He and his wife, Trina, have a son, Zayd and reside in Chico, CA.\nIn addition, Rouben is a hard-working, thoughtful designer who is inspired by giving back to his community through pro-bono community projects, specifically in Chico and the surrounding towns that have been devastated by recent fires. One project in particular, Rebuild Paradise, has been his most recent endeavor.\nIn this week's podcast, you will hear how Rouben’s travels helped develop him as a designer, being exposed to multiple cultures all over the world from such a young age. It is quite funny that he landed in the small town of Chico, California, but it is the result of his “go with the flow” nature, his ability to explore and be open to new opportunities, specifically pursuing education rather than full time practice.\nHis teaching journey began as a weekend professor, and with a twist of events and a family to support, the opportunity to become a full time professor presented itself. Years later, in the midst of a pandemic, I was interested in learning more about the design culture in virtual learning, as this field is extremely hands-on.\nHis answer was what I expected, “I am figuring it out every day.”. The lecture part is easy, but getting to work has been a challenge, specifically being able to help each student. Rouben is able to help each student with his words, such as “What about moving that wall over there?”, but the struggle comes with not being able to physically reach out and correct the student. What he has noticed that has been working is having each student scan their work, send it along, then setting aside one on one time to connect with each student and go over their project.\nWhat he has noticed is how virtual learning has streamlined the content, getting rid of busy work that is normally present in the classroom. As his first year students become more aware of different softwares, the group work will begin, but in the meantime students are working individually.\nThe biggest challenge he has seen is a student struggling to achieve a certain skill and although it is just a simple, two second fix, he is not able to physically show them, thus resulting in the student wasting time trying to figure it out themselves.\nLooking to the future, both Rouben and I are hoping for a hybrid situation to be implemented into the classroom, as many students’ creativity is sparked in the school environment, specifically from their peers.\nOn the other end of experiences being missed is the ability to go to go on field trips. Currently, students are watching an abundance of videos to take the place of being physically in the building but it is not the same. For now it is okay, but he would like to take his students to a construction site, a concrete pour, or a specific building they are studying.\nAdditionally, virtual classrooms are forcing students to become extremely organized. Unlike in the classroom where the students are able to explain their projects, everything must be self explanatory as the projects are all shared through a screen.\nWhen asking which version of the classroom he prefers and if he is itching to get back into the classroom, Rouben stated there are pros and cons of both situations. What he misses the most is the energy that fills the room and the social aspect of the learning environment. An advantage of being online for the past few months is proving that there are a handful of classes that have the ability to be fully online, even after the pandemic.\nAlthough Rouben lives in the college town of Chico, the town has seen a massive impact in the last few months, not only due to the pandemic. The neighboring town of Paradise recently experienced horrible fires, where many residents lost their homes, my in-laws included. Due to this natural disaster, many families from Paradise have relocated to Chico, creating a new environment of people.\nAs a way to give back to the community, Rouben has gotten involved in pro-bono community projects and often brings students along. The idea of bringing students along started during his time at UCLA when the current architecture bid for the VA Hospital was too far out of budget. He asked if the team would be open to working with students and when they agreed, he presented this opportunity to his students. To his surprise, twenty students showed up to participate, contributing sketches, models, and infrastructural ideas for the hospital.\nHis teaching philosophy stems back to this project, using his teaching to focus and give back to his community through projects. Through these projects he is able to instill certain values in his students, emphasizing the importance of serving and connecting with one’s community.\nYears later, Rouben used this same model to get involved with the Rebuild Paradise Foundation. After being approached by the foundation, he suggested working with students under his guidance to create a plan to build a handful of homes for the community. The students were extremely involved, taking photos, gathering information, and asking the community, builders, and other designers what they believed would be the best components for the project.\nThe design approach was something that could be simply built, something that the homeowner could build themselves. This project began in Fall 2019 and was presented right before the pandemic in Spring 2020, leaving Rouben with a stack of designs on his desk. He spent his summer going over these designs and a week ago, five designs, one being a container home, were finally approved. The simple, modest designs will be available to the public through the foundation. They are compiling all their research into a resource book that can be a source of information for anyone looking to build a home in a fire prone area.\nIt is no secret that Rouben has had a life full of adventure, experiences that many can only dream of, and these experiences radiate through his work, his teaching, and his passions.\nOutside of his work, his hobbies include anything non-architecture/design related, specifically going fishing and being in nature. He understands the importance of removing yourself from your work, yet his wife points out that he always finds design in his hobbies, something he cannot deny.\nPlease share any insight on guest speakers you would like to hear on Design Create Inspire!

In order to cool animals like chimpanzees and meerkats down, they are often treated with fruit juice and vegetable ice cream.\nAs to how the different species are adapting to the high temperatures, Hernández commented that \"the species we currently have at the zoo do not have trouble coping with these high temperatures.\"\n\"They are species that have adapted and that we can work with to ensure their wellbeing,\" he added.\nHowever, there are still some species, like the red panda, that suffer more from the heat than others. Their enclosures are watered more frequently to bring down the ambient temperature.\nThis summer, the zoo has also adopted water-saving measures due to the ongoing drought in Catalonia.\nAlthough the zoo is excluded from some of the restrictions implemented by the Barcelona council, the staff have taken some measures that save 200m3 of water every day, the equivalent of what 1,800 Barcelona residents consume.", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}

The company has provided its services and equipment for several venerable Polish TV series, feature films and documentaries over the years. Recently, EBH employed two AJA Ki Pro Mini digital video recorders to help complete \"Mission: Afghanistan,\" a 13-episode series about a Polish Military Mission in Afghanistan that began airing on CANAL+ late last year.\nProduced by AKSON STUDIO and directed by Maciej Dejczer with cinematography by Jarek Szoda, the dynamic, action-packed series brought a production crew and EBH assistants into treacherous terrain far from Warsaw for an 80-day shoot. EBH Polska Co-Owner Maciej Ostoja Chyznski explained, \"The idea was to leverage the more rugged topography of Poland to recreate an Afghan landscape for the show. Environmental conditions, however, proved to be the worst you could imagine - 80 days of dust, dust and more dust, in addition to extreme heat from blistering summer temperatures.\"\nAware of the conditions the team would face, early on EBH set out to find a lightweight Apple ProRes recorder that could survive the environmental challenges posed by the shoot. After several days of testing a variety of available options out on the market, the EBH team decided that Ki Pro Mini was the best recorder for the job.\n\"Ki Pro Mini won hands down in all of our tests. It proved durable and portable, and recorded the highest quality ProRes, plus it's easy to learn and use. We also performed worst-case-scenario testing and it passed with flying colors,\" shared EBH Co-Owner Filip Kovcin. \"Having used a number of AJA solutions throughout the years, we also knew it would prove reliable for this sort of shoot and give our client the quality results they expected. Ki Pro Mini was a natural choice for the project.\"\nAlmost the entire shoot was done handheld on Sony F3 cameras with the S-Log option, outfitted with RED 18-85mm zoom lenses. The HD-SDI output from the camera was fed to two AJA Ki Pro Minis recording at ProRes HQ. EBH was also able to leverage the output of the Ki Pro Minis to send matching timecode to all the other equipment on set, ensuring everything would remain in sync in post production. Once the footage was recorded, without having to spend additional time on ingest or transcoding, Ki Pro Mini provided edit-ready files that could be natively accessed in both Avid Media Composer and Apple Final Cut Pro.\n\"This is one of the toughest productions we've ever undertaken, but throughout all of it, the Ki Pro Minis performed flawlessly. They were very reliable and allowed AKSON to capture the highest quality ProRes in the most undesirable of conditions - all while fitting within a tight budget,\" Kovcin concluded.", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}
{"id": "138", "text": "From: Puglia, Italy\nVarietals: Mostly Negroamaro, blended with a small amount of Malvasia Nera\nTasting Notes: The 2013 Copertino Riserva is a wine to savor. Its ruby red color with garnet highlights immediately captivates the eye. The nose reveals herb-tinged red and black fruit aromas that are complemented by savory herbs, tobacco leaf, and black pepper, giving the wine depth and complexity. On the palate, this Riserva is medium-to-full-bodied, featuring brambly raspberries, black cherries, and blackberries that interweave perfectly with the herbaceous notes, creating a well-structured and balanced wine. The moderate acidity uplifts the fruit characters and gives the wine a youthful kick, while firm yet pliant tannins complete the experience. This wine is a testament to the winemaker's expertise, demonstrating the quality that can be achieved with careful winemaking and bottle aging.\nCritical Acclaim: “An intriguing red that's aging gracefully, with delicate notes of baked cherry and black fig fruit accented by dried thyme, incense and leather. Well-knit and focused, with light, silky tannins, this is still fresh thanks to its orange peel acidity and the tang of minerally iron and salt notes. Drink now through 2027.” –Wine Spectator, 90 points (2012 vintage review)\nPairing: Perfect for just about any time of year, this 10 year old masterpiece really delivers. We dare say you’ll be wanting this when cooler weather hits, but it’s the perfect richly textured red wine that’ll warm you on cool summer evenings when you want to spend all the time outdoors in front of a fire. It is also the ideal companion for barbecue! If you’re vegetarian, we’d recommend Folami’s BBQ Tofu: a recipe from Folami Prescott-Adams, and adapted by Nicole Taylor for the NYT. If not, give Melissa Clark’s NYT recipe for Grilled Pork with Whole Spices and Garlic Bread a try.\nLargely inspired by Puglia in the peninsula's southernmost reaches, ancient Greeks called Italy \"Oenotria\" – land of the vine. Today, Puglia is home to 25 production zones, most significantly the DOC Copertino. The Copertino Cooperative was established in 1935 when a group of visionary growers collaborated to produce a higher-quality wine from the region's traditional indigenous grapes.\nSeverino Garofano, the talented winemaker behind this project, has been long regarded as the most respected enologist in the Salento. With Copertino, Garofano and his growers have been catalysts for the region's pride in making modern varietal wines that stand on their own, rather than being used as simple blending resources.\nNegroamaro has long been recognized as one of the grapes best suited to the hot, dry climate and terroir in the Salento peninsula (colloquially referred to as the \"heel\" of Italy's \"boot\"). At ten years old, this wine’s age is certainly an asset; this time has allowed the Negroamaro’s tannins to sofen, and tertiary flavors to develop in the bottle.\nPayment & Security\nYour payment information is processed securely.

{"id": "139", "text": "“If people at home want to be able to keep watching the television, be able to turn the kettle on, and benefit from electricity, we have got to make these investments. It is essential to keep the lights on.”\nEd Davey, energy secretary, 21 October 2013\nThe deal was to build two reactors at Hinkley Point C plant in Somerset which would provide “a stable source of clean power from 2023, generating enough electricity to power nearly 6 millions homes”, according to a government press release.\nEDF Energy will lead a consortium including Chinese investors, with an investment of around £16bn. The China General Nuclear Power Group and China National Nuclear Corporation will be minority investors. Ministers have agreed a price of £92.50 per megawatt hour at the plant when it comes into operation.\nThe Energy Secretary Ed Davey hailed it as a “historic day”. Due to the French investment, he said, “for the first time, a nuclear station in this country will not have been built with money from the British taxpayer.”\nEssential to stop us from from having no power, though? FactCheck wonders whether we’re being kept in the dark on this.\nIt’s worth pointing out that it’s rather odd for the Lib Dem energy secretary to take this position. In their election manifesto, they said the party would would “reject a new generation of nuclear power stations. Based on the evidence nuclear is a far more expensive way of reducing carbon emissions than promoting energy conservation and renewable energy.”\nHe didn’t mention the manifesto this morning, though. At a press conference, he said that anyone who thought the power generated by Hinkley C could be generated by wind turbines was “brave”.\nAs to his point that Hinkley C is the only way to keep the lights switched on – we’re not sure why the energy secretary says this.\nAccording to Ofgem, which regulates the electricity and gas markets, the lights weren’t about to go out anyway.\nIn a report published in June this year, Ofgem said that the energy capacity was due to hit its low in two or three years, and after that, things would get better.\nCapacity margins could fall to between two to five per cent in 2015-16 – when they would “bottom out”. After that, Ofgem said, margins would begin to rise again, due to an increase in onshore and offshore wind generation, onshore.\nIt’s also the case that according to the Department for Energy and Climate Change’s own assessments, demand for electricity has been falling.\nHousehold electricity consumption has fallen by 11 per cent since 2005, and gas by 20 per cent since then. That’s due to improvements in home insulation efficiency, better gadgets such as televisions and electrical goods which use less electricity, and the recent economic climate.\nIn other words, based on current trends, Hinkley is on schedule to begin operating when things are already on the up.\nThe DECC report even said that innovations, for example more efficient boilers, home improvements enforced through tightened up building regulations, smart meters, and the government’s Green Deal, were expected to save households around 11 per cent – £166 – on their energy bills by 2020.\nIn fact, when we asked Dr Paul Dorfman of the UCL Energy Institute what he made of what Mr Davey said, he said: “We would have to have a decade of huge growth to get back to the electricity demand of 2008.”\nBased on what the regulator and the government have said, there hasn’t been evidence to suggest the lights are about to go out.\nWe realise Mr Davey is speaking metaphorically – the National Grid would have to step in and introduce measures to prevent us all from sitting in the dark if we really were at that point.\nBut it does strike us as odd that the plant wasn’t scheduled to be built before 2015-16 when we are likely to see the biggest squeeze.\nSo we asked the Department for Energy and Climate Change what Mr Davey meant by what he said.\nA spokeswoman said: “He was just making the point of how important it [nuclear] is. He wasn’t affirmatively saying that if Hinkley wasn’t built, the lights would be switched off.”\nWe also asked for a detailed explanation and breakdown of how the government had concluded that a new nuclear fleet would cut bills by £77 by 2030. The claim was repeated a number of times, and we asked repeatedly how it was arrived at. Another academic, Professor Steve Thomas, of the University of Greenwich, told us: “The idea that we can know what the electricity supply will be in 17 years is laughable.”\nWe were sent several reports of models and analysis, but no one was prepared to actually sit and show us some sums, saying simply that it was “complicated” and would be presented in due course.\nIn other words, even DECC couldn’t shed any light on the matter, nuclear or not.", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}

{"id": "169", "text": "As of October 2010, roughly 9% of Americans are unemployed. This is especially rough for those who are working on debt management. However, the following 2 months present an opportunity for many of those people. If it doesn’t pertain to shopping, lots of people get a little lazy around the holidays. That’s fine. I’m not here to judge. If National Lampoon’s Christmas Vacation is on, you’ll find me on the couch too. Everyone can use some down time this time of year. However, if you’re unemployed and/or browsing for a new job, November and December are prime times for a job search.\nA lot of people will take a break from their job search around the holidays, as they’ll be busy with family, travel, shopping, eating, etc. The thing is, the job openings are still there. This is an opportunity for the diligent to get a leg up. Use our tips below, stick to your search, and maybe you’ll land that new gig for 2011.\nUpdate your resume. Add your current job and any new skills or accomplishments you’ve picked up. You can also keep several versions of your resume on file for different types of jobs. Maybe one has some info geared towards the financial industry, and another is more about customer service. Whatever you’re into. The point is if you’re applying for different jobs, make each application specific for that job. This goes for cover letters too. If it’s generic, then so are you.\nIf you don’t have a profile already, get on it. Create your professional profile on LinkedIn.com. If you’ve already got a resume, then it’s simple enough to just transfer that info to the web. Regardless of whether or not you get a job or even an inquiry from LinkedIn, it’s still something you can point to as an online resume. Otherwise what will you do? Carry around hard copies of your resume everywhere you go? Here are some keys to using LinkedIn:\n- Have a descriptive title for your profile. In a few keywords, it should describe who you are professionally and what kind of job you may want. For example: “Marketing coordinator with a flair for event planning.”\n- Make connections with current and past employers and coworkers. These are the people who will build your online reputation.\n- Write recommendations for people you’ve enjoyed working with. This shows your closeness with coworkers, and will prompt them to recommend you as well. You can also request recommendations from people you are close to.\n- List accomplishments in your previous positions, not just responsibilities and tasks.\n- Check out LinkedIn Answers and see if you can add to a conversation. As with any networking site, the more active you are, the more visible you are. Show your expertise.\nAside from LinkedIn, manage your online presence responsibly. Do you have a Facebook profile? What about MySpace, YouTube, and Twitter? If you want all your friends to see you in your “sexy nurse” costume and the video of your longest keg-stand, that’s fine. Just be sure to adjust your privacy settings so that only friends can see them, not potential employers. It has become pretty standard for a hiring manager to do a little online research on an applicant. Google yourself and make sure nothing embarrassing comes up. If it does, get rid of it.\nFor more tips on job searching, you can also check out our previous post: Laid-Off? Prepare for the Work Ahead.\nOnline Job Listings:\nOnce your resume is up to date, upload it to the job sites and start browsing. Start with Monster.com and Careerbuilder.com. Punch in all the criteria of the job you want, and see what comes up. With an account (which is free) you can also set up email alerts and saved searches, so the site will always know what type of job you’re looking for.\nAnother great feature of these websites is the tips and tools they offer. They have advice on several topics you’ll encounter in a job search, like formatting and writing resumes and cover letters, preparing for interviews, workplace etiquette, salary negotiation, and more.\nCheck company websites too. There are a lot of jobs that don’t get posted to to the popular job sites sites like Monster and Careerbuilder. If you’re interested in working for a particular company, check their website frequently for updated job listings. The company may have its own LinkedIn page too. You may also find other job websites that are geared towards your field of interest.\nFace to Face Networking:\nThe holidays are a time when you’ll probably be seeing a lot of friendly faces. Don’t be shy about telling people you’re in the market for a new job. Friends like to help. In fact, about 40% of job seekers say that they found their current job through a friend.\nThese are all things that can be done easily during the holidays. If you’re at a party, network! Sitting home by the fire? Pour some eggnog, break out the resume, and let the editing begin! Done with your online shopping? Surf around the job boards!\nNow is also the time to sign on for seasonal employment opportunities. Just about every store and business is going to hire additional help for the holiday season. Why not pick up a few hours a week for some extra cash? Employee discounts are also a big perk this time of year. Inquire within any business that interests you. This may not be a “career stepping stone” for you, but at least it gives you something to do, keeps you in the working mindset, and puts some money in your pocket.\nAbove all stay positive, keep active, and enjoy your friends and family this holiday season.\nIf you’re struggling to pay off debt, ACCC can help.

{"id": "242", "text": "If you look at it superficially, personal finance is everything to do with money: how to get richer, where best to invest, and so on.\nAll of this, of course, is part of personal finance. But personal finance has nothing to do with money. Rather miss placed priorities and value regarding money.\nLearn to manage your money\nMoney is not the problem, the problem is the lack of it. Of course, money can’t buy happiness, but it’s not easy to be strapped for cash, and it can in turn cause a great deal of stress. Obviouls the level of stress will vary depending on the situation.\nPoverty is not just a physical limitation. It is also a way of thinking. When poverty takes over, we begin to think differently. When we think about money all the time, we begin to notice other things, to evaluate our own choices differently, to anticipate events differently, to make decisions differently, and to behave differently.\nWhether we like it or not, money has power. Most of us are highly dependent on it, and that’s where personal finance comes in. Personal finance is all about knowing how to manage money and understanding how to report cash income without a 1099 form to take advantage of it. It’s about being able to take control of your money. Ironically, the main goal of personal finance is to stop thinking about money altogether.\nMoney is not an end in itself, but a means\nIt’s easy to confuse managing money with chasing it. Sure, it’s good to have more than enough money. But, if money is your ultimate goal, you’re managing your personal finances wrong.\nThere’s no point in saving money if you don’t know what you need it for. This sense of meaninglessness will culminate in you eventually stopping saving and starting to spend mindlessly. We all need to spend our money, but making wise decisions is whats important. You could save up for a car, or a deposit on a house, but unless you consciously put that money aside, it’s all too easy to spend it frivolously.\nAlthough maintaining personal finances is not about saving as much as possible. Personal finances is about living the life you want.\nThe value of money is only in what you can do with it. If someone’s goal is to have a stash of ten million dollars, that is an empty goal. What would you like to do with that money? Set goals for yourself based on the reasons you need to save money, not saving money for money’s sake.\nIn short, money should not be the main goal. You shouldn’t sit around in a job you hate so you can save up bits of paper so you can retire one day and finally relax. You should use your money in a way that allows you to have more of what you love in your life. That means you need to save up a little so you can plan for emergencies, but make sure you put some aside for the fun parts of life.\nPersonal finance is more about thinking than maths\nOf course, there are basic rules of finance:\n- Spend less than you earn\n- Pay off loans\n- Invest money so that it generates income\nRules are important, but they don’t tell the whole story of personal finance. After all, personal finances are personal. And that means that sometimes you can and should break the rules and do what’s right for you. More than maths and rules, personal finance is about behaviour: your habits, thinking, and actions.\nI could even argue that you should focus more on your behavior than on the rules. You can read about the best ways to pay off your credit, but if you’re not serious about it, you probably never will.\nPeople often don’t manage their finances because they supposedly don’t care about money. But, oddly enough, that’s the reason they should be doing it. If you don’t like to think about money, the best way to do it is to make sure you set up a system to manage it properly. Yes, dealing with personal finances means dealing with money.

{"id": "255", "text": "Bohemia Texting While Driving Accident Lawyer\nTraffic safety experts categorize driving distractions as cognitive, visual, or manual, and texting while driving qualifies all three. Unfortunately, drivers continue to use their cell phones on the road despite increasing awareness of the dangers presented by texting while driving. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Association, cell phone use while driving caused an estimated 1.5 million car crashes in 2017 in the United States.\nIf you were recently involved in an accident with a texting driver, a well-versed Bohemia texting while driving accident lawyer might be able to recover financial compensation for your damages. Consider talking to a qualified car crash attorney about your case.\nThe Liability of Texting Drivers in Bohemia\nLicensed drivers behind the wheel of a motor vehicle owe a duty of care to others who share the road with them, which means they must act with reasonable caution at all times. This includes not texting or otherwise using a cell phone while driving, and doing so could constitute a breach of that duty of care. A driver who breaches this duty and subsequently causes an accident may be held civilly liable for any resulting injuries and damages. For more information about establishing liability, contact a seasoned lawyer.\nWith the help of a Bohemia texting while driving attorney, a civil plaintiff may be able to pursue compensation for a variety of damages. Among other losses both economic and non-economic in nature, a defendant found liable for causing an accident could owe financial compensation to the plaintiff for:\n- Medical bills\n- Lost wages\n- Rehabilitation expenses\n- Pain and suffering\n- Loss of enjoyment of life\nPotential Plaintiff Liability\nAs per New York Civil Practice Law & Rules §1411, civil plaintiffs could be subject to pure comparative fault depending on the circumstances of their accident. Under this law, a plaintiff who is partially liable for causing the accident that injured them can still recover damages, but their compensation would be reduced by their percentage of fault.\nEven if the defendant was texting at the time of the accident or shortly before, the court may also consider the actions of the plaintiff if the defense requests for it to do so. For example, if the accident victim was operating their vehicle above the posted speed limit or failed to yield the right-of-way, the court could find that both the plaintiff and the defendant bear liability for the accident.\nHowever, the court can only take the possibility of plaintiff liability into consideration if the defendant specifically brings it up. Plaintiffs in Bohemia who believe they may bear some liability in their accident should consult with a texting while driving accident lawyer about maximizing their recoverable compensation.\nContact a Bohemia Texting While Driving Accident Attorney\nHiring an attorney to help represent your legal rights and interests could be the best choice you could make when it comes to effectively seeking financial recovery through civil litigation. You should not agree to a settlement offer from the other driver’s insurance company until you have had the opportunity to meet with a skilled legal representative. Call a Bohemia texting while driving accident lawyer today to schedule an initial consultation.", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

This win put an end to their seven-game losing streak, marking a significant turnaround in their performance.\nDeAndre Ayton was a pivotal figure in this resurgence, delivering a double-double with 16 points and 15 rebounds. Anfernee Simons also played a crucial role, contributing 23 points and seven rebounds. The Suns, despite a valiant effort, witnessed their fifth loss in seven games.\nKevin Durant led the scoring for Phoenix with an impressive 40 points, while Devin Booker added 26 points and seven assists. However, their efforts were not enough to stave off the Blazers' spirited comeback.\nKey Plays and Strategies\nSimons' layup with 10.7 seconds remaining was a crucial moment in thwarting a late rally by Phoenix, especially after Portland had extended their lead to 14 points in the fourth quarter.\nReflecting on his game-deciding basket, Simons said, “I was trying to decide whether to go up with two hands or shoot a floater and at the last minute I switched it to a floater”.Ayton, who played a game-high 40 minutes and attempted a season-high 18 field goals against his former team, downplayed any personal motivations.\n“I’ve just been focused on being a Trail Blazer and establishing who we are in this league,\" he stated.Blazers coach Chauncey Billups acknowledged Ayton's focus and motivation against his former team, mentioning that he ran plays early in the game to get Ayton into an aggressive mindset.\nJerami Grant added 22 points for Portland, while Malcolm Brogdon, coming off the bench, contributed 14 points and four assists. Brogdon's involvement increased in the second half, replacing Shaedon Sharpe, who left the game due to a groin injury.\nAnother key to Portland's victory was their proficiency from the 3-point line, hitting 14 of 28 attempts, compared to just five for Phoenix.

{"id": "313", "text": "By W.B. King\nWhen the NCUA amended an existing loan participation rule in October 2022 expanding the ability for credit unions service organizations (CUSOs) to originate all loan types, Origence jumped at the chance to enter the electric vehicle (EV) market.\nTo this end, Tony Boutelle, president and CEO of the Irvine, Calif.-based Origence, told Finopotamus that in September 2023 the CUSO launched FI Connect.\n“This was to provide top-of-funnel opportunities to credit unions, allowing them to compete where purchases are being made and financing is decided,” he noted. “We originate the loan, enroll the borrower for membership, and transfer the loan to an eligible credit union partner in real-time, 24/7. The platform is equipped to handle the needs of large national retailers that want affordable lending options.”\nWhat came next was a partnership with the Austin, Texas-based Tesla, Inc., which allowed FI Connect to offer credit union financing to EV buyers through the Tesla website.\n“Tesla appreciated the credit unions’ value proposition of offering affordable auto loans, but needed a partner that could provide buyers with a uniform lending experience nationally,” noted Origence Chief Financial Officer Neetu Bhagat.\n“They liked how FI Connect could provide a single experience for buyers to take advantage of credit unions’ historically low-rate financing options. This partnership supports Tesla’s goal of removing the friction in buying a car, as FI Connect can make loans on a one-to-many basis on behalf of their buyers,” Bhagat continued. “Our credit union clients can tap into a fast-growing market, providing their financing options at the point of sale.”\nEarly Adopter: Silver State Schools Credit Union\nTo date, FI Connect has 25 credit unions in its network, a number that is steadily growing. In mid-January 2024, for example, Bhagat noted that 88 credit unions inquired to learn more about the partnership.\n“We’re currently supporting five states through our credit union partnerships and plan to add several more this quarter,” added Boutelle. “Our goal is to have credit unions live in each of the 31 states that Tesla can do indirect auto loans. We’re actively meeting with credit unions on the value of participating in the Tesla program and the benefits attributed to this new lending channel. Our partner credit unions are promoting this program as well.”\nAmong early adopters is Silver State Schools Credit Union (SSSCU). The $1.1 billion Las Vegas-based credit union serves more than 63,000 members and supports 10 branches and 202 employees.\n“SSSCU has always been a major player in the indirect market and being one of the large credit union direct lending (CUDL) indirect lenders in the state of Nevada, we were approached by FI Connect and their parent company Origence,” Senior Vice President Mel Valenzuela told Finopotamus. “The technology and artificial intelligence (AI) developed by Origence was essentially what appealed to me.”\nAccording to Atlas Public Policy, in September 2023, there were 136,000 EVs sold in the U.S., which represented a 67% year-over-year increase.\n“The majority of EV financing is done by banks – roughly 56%, followed by captives at 30% and credit union finance around 10 to12%,” Valenzuela said. “Even if 2024 isn’t as strong as years past, being a part of this new lending opportunity will increase market share for credit unions.”\nValenzuela explained that once the opportunity was offered in summer of 2023, SSSCU quickly signed up and rolled out the service in November 2023. The process was streamlined, he added.\n“Most of the IT lift came from FI Connect and Origence. The application program interfaces (APIs), the robust automation, and some human interaction, helps reduce overhead costs, thus a better net yield,” he said. “Having Origence as the indirect LOS (loan origination system) helped SSSCU with a quicker implementation and being one of the first credit unions in the nation to go live.”\nBoutelle added that great efforts were taken to ensure that implementation is as “low-lift” as possible for credit unions.\n“But we still ask for clients to be engaged and committed throughout the process. If the credit union is currently using our loan origination platform (arc OS), the implementation is much quicker,” he noted. “If the credit union doesn’t have an existing relationship with us, implementation is typically 60 to 90 days.”\nAnother attracted feature of the program, Valenzuela offered, is that there are no associated marketing or advertising costs. “The loans are spoon-fed to us and we developed robust automation, with the help of FI Connect and Origence.”\nKnow Your True Net Yields\nFI Connect currently has $3.6 billion in signed commitments from participating credit unions; a figure Boutelle said will increase throughout 2024.\nValenzuela explained that SSSCU implemented AI to optimize the automation, which includes: no-picture identification, robust underwriting decisioning and instant funding.\n“This reduces the overall overhead and allows for a strong net yield product,” he said. “Since inception, mid-November 2023, SSSCU has funded $17 million for 410 loans, and onboarded more than 400 new members.”\nBesides the “risk diversification from traditional auto loans,” he added that SSSCU is also reviewing traditional loan processes to determine how implementing AI can “enhance the member experience and increase efficiency,” so that the credit union can become more competitive in the marketplace.\n“As an experienced indirect lender, I know the indirect penetration is low. However, I have personally seen how the impact of a personalized marketing strategy at a previous credit union achieved 28% penetration amongst new indirect members,” Valenzuela said. “SSSCU will implement a similar strategy to connect with these new members and engage them to enhance products per member.”\nWhen Finopotamus asked what advice Valenzuela has for other credit unions interested in the partnership, he responded: “Know your true net yields, which includes your ‘cost/per loan” and how often an employee touches a loan in the process, and servicing costs (collections EV performance) and compare to traditional indirect.” He added: “Embrace technology/AI and be open to new ways of doing loans.”\nKeeping Credit Unions Competitive\nWhile Bhagat told Finopotamus that in order to participate, FI Connect is asking credit unions for a minimum $5 to10 million monthly commitments, the company is in the process of \"creating a path\" for credit unions with less capacity to participate. “We encourage all interested credit unions to reach out for more information,” she noted.\nFor those attending the 2024 America’s Credit Unions (formerly CUNA) Governmental Affairs Conference (GAC), Boutelle said to stop by the Origence booth to learn more about the opportunity.\n“FI Connect is the only platform in the market that allows credit unions to connect with large retailers like Tesla directly,” he said. “We’re keeping credit unions competitive and helping them prepare for the future, which is offering embedded financing options at the point-of-sale.”", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

{"id": "337", "text": "Have you ever had a ‘gut feeling’ or been told to ‘go with your gut’? You might have thought this is just an expression but research suggests that there is a connection between the gut and the brain: the gut can send signals to the brain, just as well as the brain can communicate with the gut. In this article we will explore how the health of your gut can influence your mental wellbeing and the steps you can take to improve your gut health.\nHow is gut health related to mental health\nYour gut and brain are connected physically through a nerve called the vagus nerve. This connection is known as the gut brain axis. Similarly, your gut and brain are also connected through chemicals known as neurotransmitters. These chemicals are produced in the brain and control emotions such as happiness, tiredness, anxiety and fear. When the gut is in poor health, these neurotransmitters interfere with the body’s production of serotonin (the chemical which makes us feel happy) along with dopamine and norepinephrine, resulting in potential low mood or anxiety.\nGut microbiome imbalance\nThousands of different types of bacteria (referred to as your microbiome) live within your gastrointestinal tract. These are made up of both good and bad bacteria, with the balance in favour of good gut bacteria. Studies suggest that mental health problems such as depression and anxiety may be associated with a change in balance within the microbiome in the gut, causing health issues not just in the body, but also within the brain.\nMental health and pre-existing gastro health conditions\nWhen you feel anxious, worried or stressed, you may experience pain or discomfort in your gut. There is evidence to suggest that anxiety aggravates symptoms of conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) or contributes to flare ups in Crohn’s Disease and Colitis. Moreover, the emotional stress caused by these conditions can cause symptoms such as abdominal pain and this can become a vicious circle.\nIn a large-scale study exploring the gut-brain connection carried out by the University of Southampton and King’s College London, it was shown that mental health therapies such as Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) can provide relief for symptoms associated with IBS. This signifies that there are connections between the brain and the gut and looking after your mental health could improve your gut health.\nHow to improve gut health\nA healthy and balanced diet is one of the most important things we can do for our gut health. You can achieve this by including a variety of fruits, vegetables, wholegrains, legumes, nuts and seeds in your diet.\nConsuming foods which contain prebiotics can feed the good bacteria in your gut and help them to grow. Bananas, asparagus, onions and garlic are a great natural source of prebiotic. Similarly, prebiotics can also be added to processed foods to increase their nutritional value.\nThere is still a long way to go before we fully understand the relationship between gut health and mental health. While there is no conclusive or definite evidence, it is generally accepted that a strong relationship exists between gut and mental health. As research continues, we may eventually see the development of treatments such as nutritional psychiatry in the future.\nDisclaimer: The content of this website is provided for informational purposes only and does not substitute the medical advice from a healthcare professional.", "scores": {"score": 4, "score_transform_1": 5, "score_transform_2": 5, "score_transform_3": 0}}
{"id": "360", "text": "A crypto debit card lets you purchase cryptocurrency and pay with your local currency. A cryptocurrency debit card holds your crypto balance as collateral and does not convert it into fiat. This way, you can keep more crypto and pay interest in crypto. TenX is a cryptocurrency debit card popular in Asia Pacific. This card works on the Cryptographically Secure Off-Chain Multi-Asset Instant Transaction (CS-OCMIT) network. The card converts crypto to fiat automatically when you make purchases.\nThe TenX crypto debit card has been in the works since late last year. It is a simple way to exchange crypto assets for fiat currencies. However, TenX is facing many obstacles. For one thing, 99% of businesses are hesitant to accept cryptocurrencies. Secondly, currency exchange through a centralized exchange bank can take days. TenX uses a decentralized exchange, a network of peer-to-peer computers, to convert crypto assets to fiat currency, which is a faster way to make transactions.\nIn addition to enabling two factor authentication, the TenX card features real-time notifications when the card is used. Users can also configure the type of coin they want to spend on different purchases. It also minimises the risk of unauthorized use of the card. Lastly, users are in control of how they spend cryptocurrency. The TenX card is secured by a private key, allowing them to control exactly how much cryptocurrency they want to spend on different purchases.\nThe TenX debit card also has no foreign exchange or transaction fees. Its fees are largely waived when users spend at least $1,000 a year. Unlike many other prepaid cards, the TenX card is not subject to currency exchange fees. However, it does have a $1.50 issuance fee for physical cards and $5 for virtual crypto credit cards. The annual fee is $10, which is waived if you spend at least $1,000 per year on the card. The TenX card also supports ATM transactions in select countries, including APAC and certain European countries.\nThe Embily crypto debit card lets you spend cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin, in a number of ways. You can use the card to pay for goods and services around the world, as well as withdraw cash from any ATM. The Embily platform is clean and intuitive, and the company offers a comprehensive FAQ database, guides, and manuals. The company is based in Estonia, a country known for its digital innovations.\nYou can load up to six different crypto tokens with the Embily card, and you can pay a flat 1% commission when you load the currency. Additionally, you have to pay two Euros per month to own the card. Currently, the Embily card is compatible with Apple Pay, but support for Google Pay is promised for the future. This is not yet available in the US, but if you live in that country, you can still use Embily.\nThe Embily credit card is designed for a hassle-free experience, and is compatible with a variety of major currencies. You can top up with your preferred currency, and Embily offers a competitive exchange rate when you convert your crypto to cash. Plus, you can use the Embily card wherever Visa is accepted, reducing the time and hassles associated with using a traditional bank. The Embily platform also features online financial management tools and a customer support hotline.\nAn eToro crypto debit card allows you to purchase Bitcoin with a credit or debit card. It can be used in retail stores and internationally. Once purchased, the card can be used to access eToro’s platform. However, there are some important points to consider when purchasing this card. It’s important to keep in mind that you should never invest an amount that could affect your lifestyle. You should only invest a limited amount that you can afford to lose.\nAn eToro crypto debit card isn’t going to be widely available in the United States, but it could improve the customer experience for its 12 million users in other countries. While it’s not necessary to purchase Bitcoin directly with a debit card, this option should boost customer satisfaction and differentiate the app from its competitors. Those in the US, South Africa, and Hong Kong may be most interested in the debit card.\nFirst of all, eToro requires that you provide proof of identity and address. These documents must contain your full name, place of residence, and issue date. It’s also important to provide images of government-issued identification for identification purposes. These documents can also include your address or passport. You can use eToro’s website to verify your identity.

{"id": "362", "text": "What are the most common barriers to using telehealth?\nThere are many barriers to using telehealth in healthcare. One of the most common is the lack of reimbursement from insurance companies. Many insurance companies do not cover telehealth services, or they only cover a limited number of services. This can make it difficult for patients to access care, and it can also make it difficult for providers to offer care.\nAnother common barrier is the lack of broadband access in rural areas. This can make it difficult for patients to connect with their providers, and it can also make it difficult for providers to connect with each other.\nAnother barrier to using telehealth is the lack of standardization. There is no one-size-fits-all solution for telehealth, and each provider has their own way of doing things. This can make it difficult for patients to know what to expect, and it can also make it difficult for providers to know how to best provide care.\nFinally, another common barrier to using telehealth is the lack of awareness. Many people are not aware of the benefits of telehealth, and they may not even know that it exists. This can make it difficult for patients to access care, and it can also make it difficult for providers to promote their services.\nWhat are the most common telehealth services being used?\nThere is no one-size-fits-all answer to this question, as the most common telehealth services being used in healthcare vary depending on the specific needs of the healthcare organization and the patient population being served. However, some of the most common telehealth services being used in healthcare today include remote patient monitoring, video conferencing, and telephonic consultations.\nRemote patient monitoring (RPM) is a type of telehealth service that allows healthcare providers to monitor a patient's vital signs and other health data remotely. This can be done using a variety of devices, including wearable sensors, mobile apps, and home-based monitoring devices. RPM can be used to monitor a wide range of conditions, including heart disease, diabetes, and respiratory conditions.\nVideo conferencing is another common telehealth service that is being used in healthcare. Video conferencing can be used for a variety of purposes, including patient consultations, provider training, and telehealth education. Video conferencing can be conducted using a variety of platforms, including Skype, FaceTime, and Google Hangouts.\nTelephonic consultations are another type of telehealth service that is becoming increasingly common in healthcare. Telephonic consultations allow healthcare providers to consult with patients by phone or video chat. This type of consultation can be used for a variety of purposes, including second opinions, medication management, and disease management. Telephonic consultations are often conducted using a platform like Skype or FaceTime.\nWhat are the most common reasons for using telehealth?\nThere are many reasons why healthcare providers might choose to use telehealth services. Some of the most common reasons include:\n1. Increased Access to Care: One of the biggest advantages of telehealth is that it can help increase access to care, especially for patients who live in rural or underserved areas. By using telehealth, providers can connect with patients who might not otherwise be able to receive the care they need.\n2. Improved Continuity of Care: Telehealth can also help improve continuity of care for patients who see multiple providers or who have to travel frequently. By using telehealth, providers can stay connected with their patients and make sure that they are receiving the care they need.\n3. Reduced Costs: Telehealth can also help reduce the overall cost of healthcare. By using telehealth, providers can avoid the need to travel to see their patients, which can save on travel costs and time. In addition, telehealth can help reduce the need for expensive diagnostic tests and procedures.\n4. Improved Patient Outcomes: Finally, telehealth can help improve patient outcomes. Studies have shown that patients who receive care via telehealth have better health outcomes than those who do not. This is likely due to the fact that telehealth can help improve communication between patients and their providers, as well as improve continuity of care.", "scores": {"score": 3, "score_transform_1": 5, "score_transform_2": 5, "score_transform_3": 0}}

Those taking it were asked about the quantity and quality of their experiences with 3D technology, as well as a few forward looking questions about the delivery of the technology.\nAccording to the survey, customers don’t mind shelling out for a new TV, but they’d prefer not to have to buy discs. “Consumers are very familiar with recent 3D technology” said Tamaryn Pratt, Quixel research principal. “Consumers not only prefer to receive 3D content from their cable or satellite provider, but they are willing to pay more for a 3D movie channel.”\nThe survey also revealed some interesting, if vague revelations as to what the future looks like to the general public. A third of those that were surveyed expect 3D TV in the next 12 months. They don’t mind the glasses though, according to Pratt. “Those who have seen a 3D movie in the 12 months are interested in owning a 3D TV even if it requires glasses,” she reports.\nThe survey also questioned what consumers' most trusted brands for delivery of 3D content were, and there aren’t a lot of surprises.

{"id": "440", "text": "“I’m just concerned about her. I think if they went to counseling they could make it work. I mean, that’s what marital counseling is for; when a husband and wife are unable to effectively communicate. If they refuse to go see someone, well, then…I’m not sure there’s much else they can do.”\nI sat sipping my hot cup of Starbucks coffee, and like a gifted storyteller, shared with my girlfriend Jenny every juicy detail of my friend Maureen’s troubled marriage.\n“They don’t even have sex anymore because she’s put on so much weight since her baby was born. I mean, I understand she’s self-conscious of her body. I totally empathize with that, but I just wish she’d take care of herself, ya know?”\nJenny shook her head like a good friend does to let me know she was eager for me to continue. “I’m just glad that I have such a good marriage. Patrick and I have a great thing going on and it’s because we respect each other. We spend time with one another. Maureen and her husband don’t even pray together. I suspect that’s a big reason why this is all happening.” I said.\nI’m surprised Jenny could hear a single word I was saying from down below when I was sitting so far up on my high horse. By the time I had cited the 5th example of why I had a joy-filled marriage and Maureen and her husband had a rotten one, I started getting a little tired of hearing myself speak. Just then, Jenny probed a bit more. “Do you think there’s danger of him cheating?” I could tell by the way she leaned in toward me she hoped my answer would be “Yes.”\n“I don’t know. I don’t know if he’d cheat.” I quickly replied. I felt slightly dignified for not suggesting that I knew what the future might hold for the two of them; almost a bit redeemed. Yet seemingly out of nowhere, I had this sick guilty feeling in the pit of my stomach. I decided to zip my lips for a moment and check in with that inner voice to see what was going on.\n“What am I doing?” I asked myself. “Am I really concerned about Maureen and her husband? What benefit is there for having this conversation? How in the world was I enjoying talking about such a tragic event like a possible divorce? They have children!” I spent the next couple seconds silently shaming myself. When I started to feel the tears well up in my eyes, I rejoined our conversation by letting Jenny know I had to go. “I have a million things to do today. I’m going to head back to my house.”\nOnce we parted ways, I spent some time thinking about my initial intention of involving Jenny in Maureen’s personal life. After doing so, I realized that I was just thrilled to have a piece of gossip to share. I wasn’t really seeking godly counsel or unburdening my troubled heart to a trusted friend like I had pretended. I was just sinning. And I was enjoying it way too much. I liked having interesting news. I was bored and wanted something to talk about. With this stark realization, a strong wave of guilt and shame overcame me. Here my friend confided in me her problems, and not only did I share them with someone else, but I did so to provide a source of entertainment. It was easier to spend my idle time that day talking about her life than doing the hard work it takes to focus on my own. What’s worse is, I had subconsciously disguised my sin as honest concern for my friend and claimed the darkness in my heart was something Spirit-filled. I found myself in one of the most dangerous predicaments as a Christian; deeply entangled in offense and in absolute denial about my ungodly behavior.\nThanks to our glorious God, there is a way out; even for a girl like me.\n1. Come clean with yourself. Unintentionally, I had tried to pretend that I was merely concerned for Maureen. As long as I continued to lie to myself, I would be unable to come before the thrown of God and ask Him to right my wrong.\nProverbs 28:13 He who covers his sins will not prosper,But whoever confesses and forsakes them will have mercy.\n2. Admit it; gossip is bad. Really, really bad. Magazines line our shelves with alluring headlines about celebrity gossip. Our society has convinced itself that it’s guilt-free entertainment to talk poorly about other people. But tabloids shouldn’t define what’s morally upright. To know what is truly righteous in life, we must read God’s word. And God puts gossip on His list of 6 abominable things that He detests.\nProverbs 6:17-19 These six things the Lord hates…A proud look, A lying tongue, Hands that shed innocent blood, A heart that devises wicked plans, Feet that are swift in running to evil,A false witness who speaks lies,And one who sows discord among brethren.\n3. Repent. Once you’ve recognized how sinful an act gossiping is, seek forgiveness and ask that God provide for you a way out. It’s not enough to merely be sorry. God asks that we confess our sins and turn from them to find His favor.\nEzekiel 18:30-32 Repent! And turn from all your transgressions, so iniquity will not be your ruin.\n4. Cling to Jesus: We can’t release ourselves from the tight grip sin has on us by fixating our eyes on the rules and laws that God has given us. Paul tells us “For when we were controlled by the sinful nature, the sinful passions aroused by the law were at work in our bodies, so that we bore fruit for death” (Romans 7:5) As Spirit filled followers of Christ, we are called to be free, to walk by the Spirit which enables us to live a noble life.\nGalatians 5:23: Since we live by the Spirit, let us keep in step with the Spirit.\nJessica Gavin is a freelance writer, committed wife and mother, and follower of Jesus living deliberately in the suburbs of Richmond, VA. Authentically curious about world religions, she embarked on a blog project called \"52 Prayers\" where she vowed to attend a different house of worship each week for a year in search for the truth about God.

{"id": "458", "text": "Brutality Can Never Be God’s Will, Women Of Mumbai's Bohra Community Say 'NO’ To The Painful Female Genital Mutilation\nAccording to a recent survey on female genital mutilation (FGM) conducted on 385 women of the Dawood Bohra community has revealed that a very large chunk of them want the practice to be banned. Almost 98% respondents said they went through the practice known as khatna or khafd, which involves cutting tip of the clitoris and is extremely painful.\nAnother shocking thing which came out with this survey was that almost 74% were cut by untrained traditional cutters while 15% by trained professionals. Traditional cutters are mostly elderly women in the community who use a razor to cut the tip of clitoris, leaving young girls exposed to infections and excessive painful bleeding.\nMost of the respondents were the residents of India and U.S. and belonged to 18 to 25 age group, and almost 76% of them were married. Though the survey was not made public on social media but was passed on to women who genuinely felt the need to voice their view.\n“Going to a health professional is widely common among Dawoodi Bohras living abroad. They are mainly people from the community, but may not be gynaecologists. In Mumbai too, there are some health professionals within the community to carry out the task,” says Insia Dariwala, co-founder of Sahiyo, which carried out the survey. The organisation is working towards ending the practice.\nThe practice is so horrible that as many as 149 of 309 respondents said the practice left an emotional impact on their adult life. The survey also revealed popular beliefs behind why the practice is prevalent. A total of 56% believed it was carried out for religious purposes, 45% thought that it was to decrease sexual arousal, 42% felt that it was to maintain traditions, and 27% said it was to ensure hygiene and cleanliness.\nA representative for the community, however, said the survey was not advertised in typical Bohra circles. “By excluding the overwhelming majority of the Bohras, the sample is skewed and unrepresentative. The opinions it has gathered are of people connected with the pollsters in one way or the other. It is, therefore, unsurprising that the survey says what Sahiyo wants to hear.”\nThe World Health Organisation defines FGM as procedures that intentionally alter or cause injury to the female genital organs for non-medical reasons. The WHO classifies FGM into four categories and the practice in India comes under the Type 1 and is termed as female genital cutting or circumcision.\nType 1 is referred to as clitoridectomy, which involves partial or total removal of the clitoris (a small, sensitive and erectile part of the female genitals), and in rare cases, only the prepuce (the fold of skin surrounding the clitoris). The clitoral hood is made of erectile tissue and protects the glans.", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}
{"id": "466", "text": "Some 77 years after it was first conceived, the North Spokane Corridor project takes the saying \"Slow and steady wins the race\" literally.\n\"I've lived in Spokane for seven years now, and I've heard for a long time that 'I'll never see it — it will never be built while I'm alive,'\" says Joe McHale, spokesman for the Washington State Department of Transportation. \"One thing we really want to let people know is yes, you will.\"\nConstruction on the project, which began in 2001 and is better known as the north-south freeway, is underway but faced a setback earlier this year when Gov. Jay Inlsee proposed delaying the project's funding and pushing its completion to 2035.\nBut this month, the Legislature approved House Bill 1125, which allocates another $169 million to the $1.5 billion project. The appropriations bill passed both the House and Senate last week.\nOne reason behind Inslee's recommendation to pull funding was a shortfall in the Connecting Washington account, which pays for several major projects including the North Spokane Corridor.\n\"The funding shortfall is a result of gas tax revenues coming in lower than projected,\" says state Senate Majority Leader Andy Billig, D-Spokane. \"There is less money coming in from gas tax to pay for projects, as compared to the amount the Legislature expected to have when it programmed all of these improvements.\"\nHowever, Billig says it was important to allocate the necessary funds to the North Spokane Corridor.\n\"This is a project that's already partially built, and we need to finish what we started,\" he says.\nFROM 29 INTERSECTIONS TO NONE\nState Sen. Marko Liias, D-Everett, says that currently the project will likely be finished by around 2030, which is the blink of an eye when it comes to infrastructure projects like this.\n\"A project of this magnitude and complexity, and all of the environmental review and design that needs to take place and then having construction, it just takes time to get it all done,\" he says.\nUltimately, the corridor will connect both U.S. Route 395 and U.S. Route 2 to I-90 near Freya Street. When complete, transportation officials say the new 10.5-mile freeway will reduce traffic on the Division Street corridor.\n\"Part of the promise of the North Spokane Corridor is to take traffic, and particularly truck traffic, off of Division so that we can transform Division into a much more productive, effective and aesthetically pleasing corridor,\" says Billig.\nAccording to Terrence Lynch, WSDOT's North Spokane Corridor project engineer, the freeway will remove cars from Division and reduce congestion created by the major road's 29 intersections, consequently reducing travel times and vehicle emissions caused by crawling traffic.\n\"Our traffic modeling shows somewhere in the neighborhood of 65,000 vehicles or trips a day on the freeway, and that's both directions once it's completed,\" Lynch says. \"If you think about that many trips and taking those particular trips off of the local system, that's a significant reduction.\"\nFORCED TO DRIVE\nMajor cities across the U.S. have spent trillions of dollars expanding highways and constructing new ones in an attempt to reduce traffic on major roads or freeways — with questionable results.\nAt a 2018 meeting of American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials, Roger Millar, who leads WSDOT, said building and expanding highways to solve congestion \"isn't the answer,\" and congestion \"is a problem we simply cannot solve.\"\n\"We like to talk about traffic congestion as an issue, but it is actually a symptom of a larger problem — and the problem is we don't provide affordable housing and transportation solutions,\" he said, according to the AASHTO Journal. \"We have a rich list of transportation options for the rich that can afford to live in our cities — the rest are forced to drive.\"\nNot to mention the fact that these projects work temporarily, and the traffic and sluggish travel times tend to return shortly. This phenomenon is known as \"traffic generation\" by planners, and \"induced demand\" by economists.\nAs Millar suggested, a better solution would be to fund transit or other non-automobile transportation.\nAccording to Billig and Liias, $50 million in state funds have been added to the city's transportation budget to transform the Division corridor and include bus rapid transit, bike and pedestrian facilities, and a variety of different amenities and housing options.\n\"One of the really big benefits is that we are going to transform Division from what I think is a fairly problematic corridor into something that's going to be really special,\" Billig says.\nAnother component of the project is an effort originally led by Billig and Sandy Williams, publisher of the Black Lens newspaper who died in a plane crash last year, to determine how to use surplus property from the project in a way that gives back to the East Central community.\n\"Had the project been built decades ago, I don't have confidence that it would have been built with deep community engagement,\" says Liias. \"I was really impressed with the level of engagement with individual communities and engaging them in sort of what is your vision for the project, not just what is the most efficient engineering vision.\"\nWhere the north-south freeway will eventually meet I-90 is currently the site of Camp Hope, a large homeless encampment. WSDOT is currently seeking feedback on designing a ramp there, where the north-south freeway's \"skyway\" — a 60-foot-tall section of the highway that will stretch from Spokane Community College to I-90 — meets the interstate.\n\"I actually got to get up on the deck of the new freeway; they were constructing it last summer,\" says Liias. \"It was pretty powerful to stand there and imagine what it'll be like when it's done in a few more years.\" ♦", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}
{"id": "483", "text": "Jesca Hoop - Order of Romance\nJesca Hoop returns with her sixth album, Order of Romance, a record that fortifies her position as one of the most striking and original voices in contemporary music. Order of Romance is Hoop's most intricate and finely balanced album to date, one that draws on classic song writing, recalling anything from Gershwin to Paul Simon, but creating something that is unmistakably, indelibly Jesca Hoop. It is a deep dive into craft.\nIn the summer of 2021, Hoop once again ventured south from her adopted home of Manchester to Bristol to team up with producer John Parish (PJ Harvey, Aldous Harding), her collaborator for 2019’s Stonechild. This time additional assistance came from in Jess Vernon (This is the Kit) to arrange for a four-piece horn and woodwind quintet. Legendary drummer Seb Rochford lent his skills, John Thorne plays the bass and Chloe Foy and Rachel Rimmer were enlisted to deliver Hoop’s signature vocal arrangements. The result is a fruitful marriage of song craft and arrangement, brimming with a cinematic charm and lyrical wit that signify a new chapter full of new life for an artist who knows her mind, her heart and voice well enough to trust them in uncharted territory.\nOrder of Romance then is a complete work that demands close attention, an active listen, a filagree that’s apparent lightness of touch belies a serious intent. Themes of empathy and friendship, intertwine with a clear eyed and moralistic poetry on subjects such as gun control, religious and political cults, and climate change.\nOrder of Romance is perhaps ultimately an exploration of the endless balance act of being a ‘Human Being’, an approach and examination of some of the biggest theme and issues of our time through the doorway of the personal, a way finding meaning and some kind of faith in a world where so much is disconnected and discordant.", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}
{"id": "487", "text": "You never know how precious life is, or how much you take it for granted, until you are faced with a life-threatening situation. We took a family trip to Hershey, where we planned to go on wild rollercoasters (and my favorite chocolate-making ride) at Hershey Park, checking out the Amish country and fun factories in Lancaster and hitting up our favorite “family” buffet—just like we had done before and loved. But this time, life took an unexpected turn of events.\nIt was a trip that we will all remember vividly for the rest out our lives.\nWe arrived in Hershey and checked into our hotel. We decided that after the long drive, we would hit up the park the next day, but we still wanted to do something since we were all so excited to be there. We had seen a sign for the Indian Echo Caverns, so my parents thought they would be really cool to explore and check out. So we went, and after being in intense heat all day, the cold dampness of the caverns was a shock to all of our systems. It was a boring exploration, and we were freezing. None of us enjoyed\nit, and we couldn’t wait to get out and just get back to the hotel to rest up for our much more exciting adventure to come.\nWe were all snuggled up and ready for bed, and my sisters and I were already sleeping. All of a sudden, we heard a blood-curdling scream: my mother saw my youngest sister having a seizure. None of us knew what to do, and we were all petrified that she was going to die. My mother was panicked and paralyzed with fear. At the time, we didn’t know that you were supposed to let a seizure run its course, and to just put her in a safe place until it stopped. My sister finally stopped seizing, but then was burning up with a fever. My dad immediately drew a bath to cool her down, while my other sister and I were told to go get help.\nI will never forget the two of us running out in our nightgowns, banging on doors for help, trying to get the elevator to quickly go down to the front desk to call an ambulance for our little sister. We were so, so scared. As the oldest, I tried to be calm and brave as best as I could, but even I was in a state of shock over what was happening. The people at the front desk were nice but slow, and I remember somehow finding the clarity to tell them to get an ambulance fast and explained what happened.\nIt was then that I (and my family) realized that I’m the one you can always count on to keep calm, take action and be the supportive rock to lean on in a crisis situation.\nA tough responsibility for someone to take on for the rest of her life, but it just became part of who I was from that point on.\nWe returned to the room after getting help, waiting for what felt like hours. My mother was at a loss of what to do, just cradling my sister in her arms. My dad was this pillar of strength trying to hold it all together, but I could see how truly scared he was too. We finally got her to the hospital, where I remember having to stay alone in the waiting room with my other sister, holding her tight as we both cried. We had no idea if our sister was even okay. There were some nice nurses and administrators that sat with us and tried to keep us calm. But it wasn’t until we saw our parents and heard everything was okay that we could breathe a sigh of relief.\nIt had to be the longest night of our entire lives. Thankfully, my sister was fine. They broke her fever and she was allowed to go home with us that night. But it didn’t stop us from worrying if it would happen again. Luckily, our grandparents had their summer camp trailer in Pennsylvania, not too far from where we were, so we went and stayed with them for a few days. As a mother who witnessed her own baby take a seizure once, I can understand now why we would go there instead of straight home. My poor mother (and father) were so scared about it happening again, that they needed the security of my grandparents until we all felt better that she wouldn’t have another seizure. None of us could relax and enjoy ourselves. But what we did do was come together even closer as a family, and realize how much we loved each other.\nFor me, I could have lost my sister.\nFlashing through my young brain was how mean I was to her sometimes, or how I would\nrefuse to play with her because she was an “annoying little sister.” There is something about seeing your sister’s eyes roll to the back of her head and then her body go lifeless that makes you realize, it’s not that important if she wants to play with your favorite Barbie doll—what’s important is that she is alive to play with it.\nA sister is a gift—two of them is a blessing. And I am so grateful everything turned out just fine that night.\nWant to get a new chapter each week?

{"id": "528", "text": "“How do I start playing TTRPGs?” is a broad question that’ll net you a number of blanket statements, but I’ll try to be as specific as possible to break down a multistep process for you to get started. As someone who struggles with anxiety and depression — a combo that is less than ideal for a journalist or a game master juggling seven different players in a six-hour Dungeons & Dragons game — it can be tough to break into a game that’s all about socializing, so I want to untangle this question with my experience from a different angle.\nIn this week’s column of Tabletop tips from an anxious GM (all of which can be found on our DND tips hub), I’ll be answering a question that has been posed by friend and colleague John Loeffler. He writes, “What would you tell someone who hasn't played TTRPGs but wants to go about doing so? Both from a player and a DM/GM perspective?”\nGetting into TTRPGs may seem like a daunting task, but it’s really not. It’s like any other game except you get to actually roleplay your own character. Some TTRPGs, like D&D 5e, can be a bit rules-crunchy, so that’s intimidating to some, but here are a few ways you can jump into D&D or any TTRPG with no experience whatsoever.\nFind some friends, do your research, and buy supplies. Once you get all of that done, then you just need to find a platform to meet (physically or virtually) and schedule your game. Finally, decide who’s going to be the GM, figure out the rules together, create your characters, and then just play the game.\nYou don’t need to know all of the rules in the book to have a good time, just be open-minded and accommodating to everyone. Most importantly, make sure you set boundaries and limits between the players to ensure that no one does anything to trigger anyone else. The last thing you want is a party member causing trouble for the group and ruining the fun. If someone isn’t willing to respect the boundaries in place, they don’t belong at your gaming table.\nHow to start playing TTRPGs — An in-depth look\nFind some friends. If you have people to play with already, skip this graph. Otherwise, you’re going to need to do some hunting. If you’re looking to play D&D specifically, I recommend hopping on D&D Beyond and either posting on the forums or looking for open forums requesting new players. You could also look for groups using Roll20’s LFG system, which is a virtual tabletop as well as a group finder, and you’ll find more TTRPGs on there as well. Join a Discord server — there’s one for almost every hobby, and you can meet friends or find an active game through there. You can find people in the Foundry VTT server, Astral TableTop server, or D&D Beyond server. This may be anxiety-provoking, and trust me I totally understand, but you have to put yourself out there if you don’t have anyone to play with. If you don’t like the first person you meet, move on to the next one. TTRPGs are popular with a broad spectrum of people and you’ll find a group that’s a perfect fit for you.\nDo your research. The best way to learn how to play a TTRPG is by watching other people play it. There are some great shows that revolve around D&D, like Critical Role or Dimension 20. If you’re interested in Call of Cthulhu, Good Time Society did a one-shot that’ll give you an idea of how to play. You can even find a series on Vampire: The Masquerade that Geek & Sundry did. No matter which TTRPG you want to play, there’s bound to be someone that’s played it, so invest some time in getting a feel for how it plays. It also doesn’t hurt to watch shorter videos to give you a breakdown on the rules. Go to YouTube first before spending your own money on something you might not like — not every TTRPG is for everyone. Keep in mind the people on these shows are often professional performers, don’t use them as a yardstick for your own GMing or play, but use them to get an overall feel for the game.\nBuy supplies. Once you know which TTRPG you want to play and if you like how it runs with other people, it’s time to buy some supplies. Don’t go all out. Just get the bare minimum. If you’re looking to get into D&D, I recommend purchasing an Essentials kit (physical or digital depending on where you’re playing), as it’ll give you basic rules, some dice, an adventure to play, and a bunch of handouts to make the game easier to understand. There’s also a Call of Cthulhu starter set if you want to dive into cosmic horror. Just keep an eye out for the recommended supplies in the videos you watch during your research phase.\nFind a platform. The best thing about TTRPGs is that they can be played anywhere at almost any time because it’s all in your imagination. All you have to do is pick a spot that’s most convenient to you and your group, whether it’s in a Discord server on Saturday nights or Wednesday mornings in the comfort of your own home. If it’s in-person, you can find a bunch of neat tools for your specific TTRPG, including miniatures, maps, and dice. However, if it’s virtual, you might want to take a look at our best virtual tabletop software to see what’s right for your group.\nSchedule. You can use scheduling tools, such as WhenisGood to quickly take a poll for what works best for people. Also, be transparent about how long the game will last — typically my D&D sessions run anywhere from 4 to 8 hours. Make sure you build in breaks so people don’t get too tired.\nDecide the GM. If you want to be the game master of your group, you’re going to have to put in a lot more effort in understanding the rules, making narrative decisions, and keeping up clever pacing to make everything run smoothly. Don’t worry, everyone is rough when they first start out. But you’ll have to do a little more research, and ultimately, practice makes perfect. Research will only get you so far until you figure out your own style of GMing. You can take a look at our piece on ‘how do I engage my players’ to get a better idea of worldbuilding and storytelling.\nFigure it out together. Once you’ve all gathered together, run what TTRPGers like to call a “Session 0.” Since this is your first time, it’ll be a little rough around the edges, but this is where you and everyone else figure everything out together, from making your characters and story to worldbuilding and setting structure. Everyone, including the GM, needs to be comfortable with every decision going forward, so make sure you communicate with each other. This is the best time to set expectations and limits.\nJust play. You don’t need to know every rule in the book, and you don’t need to be right about every ruling as a GM or even a player. Once you think you’ve got all of your players ready with characters they like, just go for it. TTRPGs are a constant learning experience. Even after years of playing D&D, I’m learning new things every day. I just learned that you can’t concentrate on a spell if you’re readying another spell as a reaction because it’s considered concentration, and you can’t concentrate on two things at once. As long as everyone at the table is having fun (including the GM), then the rules come second. And if there’s a rule in the book that seems dumb, throw it out — you don’t have to listen to everything. Just make sure the peace is maintained between your group — setting personal ground rules is a must, and those should never be crossed.\nI hope this helps new players and GMs out there who are just jumping into TTRPGs.

Must’ve been some limitation with APIs or the way they were scraping the data off the streamers.\nAnyway, that was enough for me to give up and stick with Apple Music (who says barriers to exit aren’t as important as barriers to entry, sometimes?).\nBuuuut it has come to my attention that apps now exist to migrate whole libraries, not just playlists. I haven’t tried them yet, so this isn’t an endorsement, but I thought I’d do a quick mention here in case you’re in the same situation and have been looking for a tool to help.\nThe problem is that in the meantime, I’m not sure anymore that I want to migrate, because recent improvements to Apple Music have increased how much good new music I discover on the service… ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯\nI’m considering running both services in parallel for a while, a kind of cage-fight of music streaming, to see which emerges victorious.\n🤬 I know why they do it, but I still hate the \"help me fill out cell D12 in my spreadsheet\" types of questions during earnings calls.\n🤔 Remember the panic about blood clots a few months ago?\n✍️ Muphry's law:\nMuphry's law is an adage that states: \"If you write anything criticizing editing or proofreading, there will be a fault of some kind in what you have written.”\nThe name is a deliberate misspelling of \"Murphy's law\".\nThis is perfectly illustrated by this Twitter account which tracks the typos made by another account solely dedicated to pointing out typos and errors in the New York Times.\nh/t friend-of-the-show Alex!\n💚 🥃 Rather than try to convince you to become a paid supporter, I’ll do something a bit different today. As a follow-up to my jargon thing in edition #166, I’ll just post this classic monologue by the late George Carlin (h/t to reader Kamil Ryszkowski for sending it):\nA Word from our Sponsor: In Practise\nDo you want to invest in high-quality businesses?

All are available on mobile and desktop.\nAll for the price of only $40 per month.\n🌟 Sign up here (free plan available). 🌟\nTwo great recent interviews you’ll love:\nInvesting & Business\nJeff Bezos 2004 Amazon All-Hands Meeting\nAs told by Jeff Lawson:\nIn September 2004 I joined Amazon as a product manager, and at the first all-hands meeting I attended, our founder and CEO, Jeff Bezos, said something that has stuck with me ever since. [...]\nsomeone in the crowd of about five thousand people got up and asked a question about retailing—I don’t even remember exactly what it was. But Jeff came back with an answer most of us didn’t expect.\n“Amazon,” he said, “is not a retailer. We’re a software company.” [...]\n“Jeff’s point was that Amazon was just as much a software company as Microsoft or Oracle or Adobe. It just happened that instead of being the product that we shipped to consumers, our software ran behind the scenes, allowing us to ship brown boxes with books or music or just about anything to someone’s doorstep.\n“Our business is not what’s in the brown boxes,” he said. “It’s the software that sends the brown boxes on their way.” We monetized our software not by selling it directly, but by selling everything else—books, DVDs, and CDs. What’s more, the quality of our software would determine whether we succeeded: “Our ability to win,” Jeff said, “is based on our ability to arrange magnetic particles on hard drives better than our competition.”\nI had heard that very last sentence somewhere in the past, I don’t know if it was someone else reporting on the same event or if Jeff just used that one a bunch of times (I’d bet on the latter — as I wrote in edition #74, Bezos is very good are compressing ideas into memorable and effective bite-sized capsules).\nBut anyway, I’ve always loved that way of putting things. Crazy to to think that you have a huge organization, but what matters most at the end of the day is having a better sequence of 01010101000101010111010101010 than the competition.\nI also liked this part:\nSo at Amazon, an internal culture of API documentation arose. One team could find another team’s API documentation and start using their services, often without even needing to talk. [...]\nIf one team ran their service on ten thousand servers, was that good, or was that horribly inefficient? And what business purpose should that cost be ascribed to? So Amazon started ascribing a cost to using these services, even internally. Some people call this transfer pricing, but in fact it’s a system of doing two things: holding teams accountable for their costs, and deciding where to put more resources in budget cycles.\nSmall teams are accountable for the efficiency of their service, because they have to effectively publish a “price” for internal customers, and those internal customers have to pay the costs out of their P&Ls. If those “customers” aren’t happy with your costs, then you have work to do. The internal system of accountability aligns everybody’s interests and creates a natural incentive to drive for greater efficiency over time. Internal pricing also enables leaders to make good budget decisions. [...]\nwithout an equalizing scorecard across your initiatives, it wouldn’t necessarily be clear what teams need more investment. So that’s why adding a pricing function, even for internal customers, is tremendously useful.\nAmazon is known for the two-pizza teams and for the API culture for interfacing with internal and external orgs that was decreed by Bezos himself, but this second part is less well-known.\nPutting a price on internal resources certainly has had to contribute to better capital allocation and efficiency than if the only real “cost of capital” was what you could convince a manager to sign off on…\n‘Amazon cloud executive Charlie Bell is leaving [AWS] after 23 years’\nSpeaking of Amazon, I wonder where Bell will go next.\nAny cloud company looking for a CEO right now?\nOne Does Not Simply Walk Into Gaming + My Old Apple Gaming Theory\nGavin Baker with an interesting take on how hard it may be for big tech to compete with the gaming companies in VR:\n1) Roughly 20 years after launching the first Xbox and making it a top strategic priority over the last few years, Microsoft still trails Sony from a units, revenue and profit perspective in console gaming.\n2) Yet so many are quick to assume that it's going be trivial for other megacap tech co's to design amazing VR hardware and develop an ecosystem that can compete with the Xbox/PC and Sony gaming ecosystems whenever they decide to get serious about VR. Might be 2022 for Sony.\n3) I promise the first party VR AAA exclusives from Sony and Xbox will be more compelling to gamers than any Oculus exclusive so far. And post Bethesda, this is going to include a lot of top 20 titles.\nEverybody assumes that they can just walk into gaming, but it's a different culture (not always in a good way, ugh) and requires many specialized skills that the big tech companies may not have, or that may conflict with other priorities.\nF.ex., Apple has everything it needs on paper — great hardware and human-interface skills, great software skills, a huge distribution channel — but they just never got it (non-casual gaming). Does Facebook truly *get* (non-casual) gaming?\nA few years ago, I thought Apple was going to become one of the main gaming companies simply by coming out with an Apple TV that was basically a gaming console.\nSell it with a great game controller 🎮, have great graphics and a great development platform, plug into App Store existing distribution, and devs would jump on board to have a chance to sell their games into one of the biggest and most profitable ecosystems of customers out there.\nDay 1 they could’ve had lots of more casual titles available from iOS ports, and then they could seed the ecosystem by doing very favorable deals with the big studios to port their big titles to Apple too, and maybe acquire a studio to have some good AAA exclusives…\nEverything could’ve lined up. But 🕹Serious Gaming 👾 just isn’t in Apple’s DNA.\nCan Facebook pull it off? Or will they create a bunch of VR for social stuff, some casual games, and have Oculus as a PC peripheral, but the serious VR gaming will end up on Sony and Xbox (and maybe Nintendo at some point?). ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯\nThe Trade Desk’s Rule of 143 + Connected TV\nTTD with revenues up 101% and EBITDA margin at 42%.

We sent out this apologetic email to the top 15 customers or something by volume. And we basically said, \"Hey, we're thinking we need to raise the price to about $15/month. Would that be okay with you?\" And bless his heart. This guy Edwardo from Brazil wrote back and he said, \"Guys, this price is so low that I may have to stop using your product because there is no way you're going to be around in a year. So don't charge me more but you better raise your price.\" [...]\nMitch stops and says, \"Peter, in this meeting, you need to ask for $120,000 contract.\" And I was like, \"Mitch, that is 1000 times more expensive than our public price listing. I don't know what you're smoking. I cannot go in and ask for a 1000x price increase.\" And he's like, \"Well, then I quit as your sales advisor.\" It was literally our first thing. And I was like, \"Okay, I'll ask for $120,000.\" So we go into this. He's like, just trust me. That's the base rate for any enterprise contract which in retrospect is true. As we go into this thing. And then Nat's like, \"Okay, well what's the price?\" And I was like, well, and I turned beet red. I was like, \"Nat the price is $120,000.\" And I was not believable in any fashion. And he looks at me and is like, \"How about $12K a year?\" And I was like, \"How about $18?\" So he agrees to $18K and became our first contract, I think or the second contract once we finally got around to signing. So he was victorious. He saved 85%. I was completely mind-blown because here we were charging 150x, literally 150x. That was a second big awakening moment for me. That the value that we were attaching in our minds was on a cost basis rather than a value basis. And then we had no understanding of the value that we were actually providing to customers but in B2B sales, value is what you should sell on and value is what matters to the customer. They couldn't care less what cost basis is.\nThis reminds me of a discussion I’ve often had about Apple, and how they can charge a lot more for CPU, storage and RAM upgrades than, say, some random PC or Android maker.\nIf you’re not differentiated, you have to compete on price. Duh.\nIf you charge more than what someone else who is selling something pretty functionally equivalent is charging, they’ll just switch.\nBut if you *are* differentiated, price still matters, but a lot less, and you can charge closer to the value provided.\nDoubling the storage on my iPhone from 128gb to 256gb may not cost Apple anywhere close to $100 in parts, but the value it provides me is more than $100 (storing more photos and videos of my kids, more podcasts, apps, TV show episodes, whatever.. not having to worry about running out of space and having to deal with that. That’s worth a lot more than $100 in utility to a lot of people).\nThey can charge for it because if I’m not ready to pay, all that’s available to me is pretty different and may not be what I want.\nThink of it this way: If your partner wants to upgrade their old iPhone and asks you to go buy a new one, and you come back with a Samsung Galaxy and tell them you saved $100 on the storage upgrade, what will they say?\nMario Gabriele wrote about crypto-exchange FTX, and this part stood out to me:\nPart of FTX’s popularity is due to the leverage it offers traders. Thanks to the risk engine described above, it is able to provide a higher margin with less work, relative to other exchanges.\nFor most of its brief history, FTX has offered 101x leverage. Hypothetically, that meant that if a trader added $100,000 to their account, they could invest $10.1 million. While winning trades can make a huge sum of money thanks to this leverage, losers can find themselves quickly buried by a bad bet.\nAfter its most recent fundraising round, FTX noted it was reducing the available leverage on the platform to 20x.\n‘what a round trip’\nScience & Technology\n‘perhaps the most successful cyber attack in the history’, Belarus Edition\nFound this via Eliezer Yudkowsky, and his tweet provides good context:\nAny time you propose giving a government surveillance powers, you need to keep in mind how awful almost every government is at computer security.

In recent years, researchers and developers have been exploring the potential of these technologies in the world of trading, where speed, accuracy, and efficiency are critical to success.\nQuantum Computing for Trading\nQuantum computing is a revolutionary technology that uses quantum mechanics to perform calculations that are impossible for classical computers. One of the most promising applications of quantum computing in trading is optimization. Trading algorithms often involve complex optimization problems that require significant computational power to solve. Quantum computers have the potential to solve these problems much faster than classical computers, which could give traders a significant advantage in the market.\nAnother potential application of quantum computing in trading is risk management. Quantum computers can simulate complex financial systems and analyze the potential risks associated with different investment strategies. This could help traders make more informed decisions and reduce the risk of losses.\nMachine Learning for Trading\nMachine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that involves training algorithms to learn from data and make predictions or decisions. In trading, machine learning algorithms can be used to analyze vast amounts of data and identify patterns that are not visible to the human eye. This can help traders make more accurate predictions about market trends and identify profitable investment opportunities.\nOne of the most exciting applications of machine learning in trading is algorithmic trading. Algorithmic trading involves using computer programs to execute trades based on predefined rules and parameters. Machine learning algorithms can be used to optimize these rules and parameters, which can lead to more profitable trades.\nQuantum computing and machine learning are two technologies that have the potential to revolutionize the world of trading.

{"id": "560", "text": "(Lecture given in Montevideo, March 20th, 1939 by Carlos Bernardo Gonzalez Pecotche*)\n\"I will address in this conference interesting aspects of the evolution of the thoughts, and I will also explain how the cultivations made by the student of Logosophy in the laboratory of his mind come to mature.\nDue to the broad and profound nature of this topic, I will have to address it in parts, using as a reference some aspects related to the central image of the conference.\nIt can be generally observed, and quite frequently, that the majority of people seek to resolve their problems or find solutions to complicated situations, or difficult occurrences that appear in the course of life, only during the brief moments that their minds deal with them and when the threat of danger already coerces them and urges an immediate and final decision.\nLogosophy defines this position as inconsistent, unreasonable and illogical, comparing it, for example, to a person who seeks to eat the fruit before planting the tree, living in a house before building it, or reaching his destination before starting out. The same could be said of a man who would desperately try to accelerate the growth of a tree to obtain the fruit long before its time, or hastily build a house disregarding the solidity of its structure and shape just to live in it even before the roof and doors are put up, or even curse the vehicle that carries him to his destination just because it does not speed ten times faster to satisfy his whims and affliction.\nAs already mentioned, this occurs quite frequently because one forgets that one has a mind which, once organized, can resolve all situations happily and protect one against disagreeable changes that affect one's sensitivity so much. In other words, I would not exaggerate by saying that what the common man uses least are his precious mental faculties, the only ones capable of allowing him to live life consciously and breathe in peace.\nSeveral times I presented to some advanced students problems or cases, asking them for a solution; in other words, I proposed to their minds such problems or cases to observe how each one would resolve them.\nAfter a prudent waiting period during which an exchange of ideas would take place over the subject matter, I decided to suspend the conversation, for the time being, to be pursued later.\nI proceeded in this manner two or three times..., addressing the proposed topic selected for the experiment.\nAs expected, in nine out of ten cases, I was able to confirm the point being made tonight in my dissertation.\nIn fact, during the second or third time around, pretending to be distracted, I addressed another topic before getting around to the one that was selected. I could notice during the conversation the facility with which the topic was now being addressed and how there suddenly appeared clear and satisfying conclusions to the problems or cases whose solutions were so difficult to reach during the initial conversations. At that moment they were shown the observations and solutions they had noted initially, and the surprise was unanimous.\nI will now explain how this process of maturity is produced in the mind.\nThe investigator of Logosophy, who has already acquired certain cognitions on the action of the thoughts as autonomous entities, does not force the free exercise of his mental faculties as would a person seeking a hasty and sudden magical formula to resolve the problems that unexpectedly coerce him. He stimulates them continuously, allowing them to absorb all pertinent elements while protecting them as much as possible from external perturbances that impede the process toward the solution that is elaborated in the mental area.\nFrom time to time the topic in question is addressed mentally by each of the participants in the experiment in order to maintain in readiness the thoughts that were used and to stimulate the faculties to perform their function of preparing the specific elements which, when absorbed by the thoughts in charge of this mission, will produce the finding.\nThis is how, in many instances and without undue effort, the needed solution emerges by itself, having matured after thorough and discernative labor totally exempt from any haste.\nNaturally, this should not constitute for the student of Logosophy a motive of personal glory because it is unwarranted; he knows its origin, that is, the source which he uses to obtain these results and he knows also that such results are a consequence of a lucid and correct application of the cognitions that Logosophy places within his reach.\nThe current academic disciplines in the universities, schools and classrooms in general use the system of mnemonic repetition of the topics that constitute the program or courses being taught.\nThe objective is to etch images of these topics, but the results obtained only achieve reproducing them in the mental retina where they remain from that moment onward immobile and unable to be moved, since they lack a life of their own or the power originating from their original source.\nLater on, when the student starts to use these images, he finds himself obliged to correct in each case the defects they present, not the defects of the original images but the defects of the reproduced images, because he ignores how they were constructed in the first place. He then experiences in practice the need to create new images which gradually substitute for those stored in his memory, which by now have become mostly worn out and useless.\nThe new images - in this case cognitions - that he carefully places in his mind become achievable and display an array of living colors because they were made of the same element that exists within his own mental sphere. The common university student does not know of this process because he ignores how thoughts act and how they form nuclei to constitute the results or solutions being sought. Nevertheless, in spite of doing it unconsciously he achieves the objective; I refer to the process of reproducing images by his own experience.\nI notice that some of the students present here have started only recently the study of this new science. For their own benefit I would like to say that I find it logical for those who are not familiar with the Logosophical literature or, better still, its specific terminology, to encounter initially certain difficulties in understanding the truths exposed by Logosophy in spite of its simple and easy language...\" - to be continued\n*Excerpt from the book \"An Introduction to Logosophical Cognition\"originally published in Spanish.

{"id": "576", "text": "Open Container Law in Texas\nThe current open container law in Texas was part of a push to make the laws around drinking and driving stricter. Moreover, they had to comply with the Federal Transportation Equity Act to ensure the state received funding.\nFor over a decade, there have been no significant changes to the open container law. However, many Texans remain confused about what the law covers. When you receive an open container ticket in Houston, TX, it’s not always easy to navigate the legal system.\nWith an experienced criminal defense attorney, you have someone to guide you through it. Schedule a free case evaluation today to learn more.\nWhat Is an Open Container?\nThe term “open container” seems simple at first. However, the penal code is not so easy to interpret. The Texas Penal Code, Title 10, § 49.031 covers possession of an alcoholic beverage in a motor vehicle.\nPer the penal code, a person commits this offense when they knowingly possess an open container in the passenger area of a vehicle on a public highway. This applies whether the vehicle is in transit, stopped, or parked.\nFor many Texas, the open container law leaves them with many questions.\n- Can a passenger have an open container or is that against the law, too?\n- Does an open container ticket go on your record?\n- If the open container is in the trunk, is that illegal?\n- Is it legal to drive with an open container of alcohol anywhere in the car?\n- What are the consequences if I unintentionally violate this law as a driver or passenger?\nAt first, you might think you understand what qualifies as an open container, public highway, and passenger area. However, many Texas drivers don’t realize that these laws are stricter than many believe.\nFor instance, “open container” applies to a bottle, flask, or other container with any level of alcohol in it that is currently open or has been opened. Put simply, a previously opened bottle of whiskey counts under the open container law in Texas.\nThe only exclusions are containers that have never been opened or still have an intact factory seal.\nWhat Counts as the “Passenger Area”?\nThe “passenger area” of this law is also a point of confusion. Essentially, any area where a container of alcohol is visible to the driver and within reach counts. However, the law specifically excludes open containers in the following areas.\n- A locked glove compartment\n- The trunk\n- Areas behind the back row of seats in cars without trunks\nLastly, while the penal code refers to “public highways” specifically, this includes more than interstates and freeways. In reality, it applies to any container on a publicly maintained road.\nAdditionally, it includes areas immediately around any public road. So, if you park on a quiet back road, it’s possible to violate this law.\nWhat Are the Penalties of the Open Container Law in Texas?\nOn its own, possession of an open container in a vehicle is a Class C misdemeanor. The base penalties include a fine of up to $500. It carries no mandatory jail time.\nSo long as you and your passengers violate no other laws, you receive a ticket and pay a fine. However, a violation of the open container law enhances the penalties of other crimes.\nFor instance, if you face DWI charges, an open container in your vehicle increases the fines and jail time you face. Oftentimes, we refer to this as an “open container enhancement.”\nIn such a case, this violation of the open container law is open to treatment as a Class B misdemeanor. This level of misdemeanor carries fines of up to $2,000 with potential jail time of up to 180 days.\nSimilarly, if you receive a charge for an open container while on DWI probation or with a suspended driver’s license, the potential penalties grow yet more severe. No matter the penalty, it’s important to understand how far-reaching the consequences can be.\nWhile the state’s punishment is limited to a relatively minute fine, it goes on your record. Often, this has a negative impact on academic and career pursuits. For example, you might have a harder time attaining financial aid.\nAdditionally, many employers check criminal records. Moreover, when you need a professional license or security clearance, these records come under consideration. Lastly, car insurance companies often consider people with open container law convictions a higher risk. That leads to higher monthly premiums.\nFighting an Open Container Charge\nWhether you face basic open container charges or an enhancement to your DWI, you have an opportunity to fight the charge. If an officer pulls you over, the law requires that they have reasonable suspicion and sufficient cause to search your vehicle.\nIf your charges stem from an illegal stop or an unlawful search, you need an experienced criminal defense attorney on your side. At The Martinez Law Firm, our DWI defense attorneys have a great deal of experience and expertise. Let us help you protect your future and fight for your rights.\nDon’t hesitate to schedule a free consultation today.", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

Sometimes, it's a happy discovery: when your current hair is longer, stronger, has more density than in the picture. But other times..., it is rather quite a shameful and discouraging experience to see your hair has deteriorated...\nBut how can you ensure your hair keeps growing? It’s simple. Do those 3 things and you will see results. It's guaranteed.\nKEEP THE MOISTURE IN\nThe main challenge with our curly hair is that it looses its moisture very quickly. I mean, very quickly. Everything we do seems to remove moisture from our hair: touching it, friction (hello pillows and scarfs!), synthetic material (collective side-eye to hair extensions…). However, luckily for us we have products and techniques that help boost moisture in our hair and keep it in.\n- Hair butters will help seal-in the moisture in your hair. Put some just before you jump in the pool or swim at the beach to protect your hair from the dryness caused by the chlorine or the salty water. Also, this is a must if you wear hair extensions: apply some just before you braid your hair. It will keep your hair moisturized and protected during even when you wear extensions for extended periods of time.\n- Try to reduce friction every time you can: satin bonnets, satin pillow cases, lining your winter hats with satin are your go tos\n- Reduce manipulation with protective hair styles : braids, wigs, plaits, twists. Anything that will keep your hands out of your hair!\nSTRENGTHEN YOUR HAIR\nMoisture gets all the spotlight, rightfully so. However, if your curls get spongy, is over-elastic, look limp, lack definition, then it is because your hair needs protein.\n- Protein deep treatments will help reconnect the protein chains inside the hair, giving the structure back to each hair strand.\n- To prevent weakening your hair; reduce the usage of heat because it breaks the structure that gives the curl pattern to your hair. This is why heat damaged hair will look straight and limp even when wet... It's summer girl... so take a break with that air dryer!\nLet’s make one thing clear: your curly hair grows. Yes it does. All hair grows between 0.5- 1 inch per month. The reason why you do not see the length is simply because when it grows, it creates a new curls instead of appearing longer. But the good thing is that if you stretch it, you will see the length! So the lesson is to leave your hair alone. Stretch your hair (only a few times thought) just to see how much it has grown. But it is all about being patient and letting your hair live, be and create that next curl.\nNext time you wonder if your hair is growing, just remember that it is growing beautiful, strong, healthy, glorious curls!", "scores": {"score": 3, "score_transform_1": 5, "score_transform_2": 5, "score_transform_3": 0}}
{"id": "641", "text": "“Sam Breakstone, get out of the tub!” It’s a phrase I hear in my head every time one of my kids spends too long in the bathtub, their fingers pruny, and at least a pint of soapy water spilled on the floor. The phrase comes from a 1997 ad for Breakstone’s cottage cheese, in which Sam Breakstone has one of his signature epiphanies — this time, to take his cottage cheese out of their tubs and into individual containers, for freshness. Throughout the 1980s and 90s, Sam Breakstone entered the homes of millions of Americans through dozens of ads, but his very existence and the history of the brand touted on the tubs themselves is something of a ruse.\nFounded in the late 1800s by a pair of Jewish immigrant brothers, Joseph and Isaac Breakstone (originally Bregschtein) from Panemuné, Lithuania, Breakstone’s dairy products — especially butter — are synonymous with Passover. To this day, their butter is the only certified kosher for Passover butter on the market. But the exact origins of this Jewish-owned brand are the subject of some debate. Despite the fact that Breakstone’s products proudly proclaim “Established 1882” on every product, the likelihood of the business being founded that year is incredibly low, according to Jordon Davis, the author of the blog “Finding Sam Breakstone.”\nCiting Rabbi Jeffrey Marx, a scholar of dairy products and a direct descendent of the Breakstone’s family, Davis shows that Joseph Breakstone immigrated sometime between 1878 and 1882. Isaac followed in 1882. For a few years after that, the two worked as peddlers, possibly living in Pennsylvania. By 1885, they were back in New York, where Joseph opened a grocery store at 27 Orchard Street in Manhattan. Isaac continued to peddle dry goods until 1888, when he entered the dairy market, selling milk and other dairy products. Over the next couple of years, the Breakstone family built their reputation in the world of dairy, with both brothers as well as cousins Morris and Hyman, owning stores of their own.\nIt wasn’t until 1897 when the family came together under one retail roof, with Joseph, Isaac and Morris starting Breakstone Brothers, a grocery selling fresh food, including dairy products, on the Lower East Side of Manhattan. They copyrighted the name in 1906, and in 1907, they began manufacturing dairy products at a small plant in Brooklyn.\nAccording to a 1982 article in The Anniston Star, “At a time when most American housewives were still churning their own butter and making their own soft cheeses, the brothers brought convenience to their customers. They sold butter from big wooden tubs, dipping scoops to order.” The company was among the first to use trucks to deliver their products. A “cream cheese box spectacular” manufactured by Hoover Bros and Graham Body was made exclusively for Breakstone’s.\nIn 1912, Breakstone’s began manufacturing from a facility in Walton, NY, allowing them to ramp up production considerably. This would be the location referenced on Breakstone’s packaging for many years: “1882, Walton, NY,” though it reflects neither the true origin of the brand nor the original location. During WWI, Breakstone’s was the largest producer of condensed milk for the armed forces. Then in 1920, the family began to mass market their products to consumers, finally making soft cheeses and other dairy products affordable for the average Jewish consumer, according to Rabbi Marx.\nIn 1925, Breakstone’s began designating their products as kosher, as mass production opened them up to a largely Jewish audience who could afford their products for the first time. “They are marketing specifically for a Jewish clientele,” Marx explains. “Even their ads in the Jewish Forward are pitched toward Jews. They’re in Yiddish, and they suggest substituting Breakstone’s cream cheese to make all sorts of traditional Jewish dishes. The ads say things like, ‘Your blintzes will taste better when you use Breakstone’s cream cheese.’”\nThough the exact timing of the kosher for Passover designation for Breakstone’s products is unknown, Marx references his own collection of Breakstone’s memorabilia (on display at the National Museum of Jewish History in Philadelphia), citing two boxes from 1930 with rabbinic hechshers noting that they are kosher for Passover. These are the earliest examples of the designation Marx has found in his research.\nFifth generation family member Warren Breakstone, another genealogy hobbyist and collector of Breakstone’s memorabilia echoes Marx, saying, “This was a Lower East Side brand, so they were catering to those early customers, and that became an early niche that continues to this day.”\nHaving grown the business to a regional level by 1928, Joseph and Isaac sold the business to National Dairy Products, a huge conglomerate of dairies and distribution centers that went on to merge with Kraft-Phenix. Joseph retired at the time of the sale, passing away two years later. Isaac, however, continued to serve as the chairman of the board until his death in 1945. Under National Dairy, Marx explains, the brand flourished, finally becoming the household name it is today.\nIn 1977, another Breakstone was born, so to speak. Sam Breakstone, the persnickety, dairy-obsessed figure that became synonymous with the brand, was created by the Richard K. Manoff Inc. marketing group for Kraft, likely to appeal to consumers by referencing the high standards of what was known as a family brand, though the family was long removed from the business by then.\nPlayed by Sam Vale (the same actor who portrayed Dunkin’s Fred the Baker), the long suffering dairyman routinely berates his employees, attempting to make a perfect product while being attacked by his dog, a Jack Russel Terrier named Jake. “But if Sam weren’t so demanding,” the ads said, “his cottage cheese (or sour cream, depending on the commercial) wouldn’t be so good.” The commercials featured a fictitious storefront located on Sullivan Street between Houston and Prince, about a mile and a half from the original Breakstone grocery store.\nIn 1981, Kraft published a slim cookbook called “Sam Breakstone’s Favorite Recipes,” which included just under 30 dairy-based recipes, like Mrs. Breakstone’s Coffee Cake and something called Sam’s Corny Casserole, a warmed up heart attack of corn and zucchini suspended in sour cream, cottage cheese and butter. The fictitious Breakstone continued to represent the brand well into the 1990s, until Vale retired in 1997.\nThough the family had long since gone on to other pursuits by the time of his commercials, Sam Breakstone carried the family name and reputation forward for new generations to identify with and enjoy (irascible though he was). After several sales, mergers and reports of declining dairy sales, Kraft (now the Kraft Heinz Company) sold Breakstone’s to Lactalis in 2020, as part of a larger restructuring. No longer involved directly in the business, descendants like Warren Breakstone and Rabbi Marx still take an unmistakable tone of pride when recounting the history of this immigrant-founded family business, one known for high standards and high quality.", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

{"id": "687", "text": "By 2020, the Millennials are going to overtake their elders as the largest portion of the workforce. With more than 76 million of them, this generation is made up of those born between 1980 and 2002. And their impact on the workplace is about to be felt.\nFor many companies in the technology integration space, Millennials are becoming more core to the business. As companies are growing or replacing their workforce, it’s becoming increasingly likely that the individuals they’ll hire will fall into this bucket. As their representation in the workplace is growing, it has been challenging for business owners of different eras to acclimate with the “unique” working style they desire (and require to be happy and productive).\nWhat are company owners and managers supposed to do with this group? As digital natives, they’re actually quite fitting for tech-focused businesses.\nHowever they fit into our workplaces, Millennials, Gen Xers, and Baby Boomers need to learn to work together. This is entirely possible. For the best chance of success, try these four tips for better connecting to Millennials in the workplace.\nMore than 60% of Millennials have already changed jobs at least one time; a staggering 91% don’t foresee themselves in the same position three years from now. Millennials tend to be more interested in building skillsets that drive employability rather than employment.\nIn the past, it wasn’t uncommon to stay with one career and employer for as long as possible. But this generation is seeking to make regular changes that give them exposure to new opportunities. Employers wanting to combat this must consider regular changes, such as training and job rotation that slows burnout and keeps this group interested in the work they’re doing.\nOffer Flexible Work\nAmongst Millennials, just under 90% would prefer to work at a time of their choice as opposed to 9-5. Nearly half of Millennials would take flex time or more vacation over increased pay. This generation is highly motivated by flexibility. For most integrators, there are some positions that don’t fit well with this line of thinking; however, for sales pros, programmers, or financial managers, is it possible to offer a little more schedule flexibility as long as the work gets done?\nMany companies still subscribe to 9-5 hours, but really have no idea why. Perhaps this is a way to garner better talent without having to pay as much. Perhaps it will even drive loyalty?\nMore than half of Millennials would rather give up their sense of smell than their iPhone. (Who needs to taste their food?) They are highly connected to their devices, apps, and their social networks. They seek to work with companies that embrace technology like BYOD, and that have an open mind about social media networks. Did you know that 56% of Millennials won’t even work for a company that doesn’t allow employees to utilize social media?\nIf you really want to get Millennials on your side, then perhaps the most important consideration is helping them see where the business is going. Studies have shown that 95% of Millennials are more motivated to perform when they know where they’re headed.\nAlso, 80% seek regular, on-the-spot feedback instead of formal (delayed) reviews. That same 80% seeks regular feedback from their managers. In short, Millennials must feel close to the company and their bosses, or they will quickly become disconnected.\nWhile we may interpret Millennials’ fickle and demanding employment style as entitlement (or even laziness), they truly see work differently. But when they are properly motivated and incentivized, Millennials can become tremendous assets by bringing creativity and solutions that meet the demands of a world being born and raised on technology.\nHow does your company work to engage Millennial employees?

One essential nutrient that plays a crucial role in fetal development is folate. However, there has been a lot of talk regarding which type of folate is the optimal choice in pregnancy. Today, we will explore the differences between methylated folate and folic acid and discuss which may be the better choice during pregnancy.\nWhy is folate so important in pregnancy?\nFolate, a B-vitamin, is vital for the formation of DNA and the development of the neural tube in the early stages of pregnancy. Neural tube defects, such as spina bifida or anencephaly, can occur when there is a deficiency in folate. To prevent such complications, we recommend folate supplementation during pregnancy.\nWhat is Methylated Folate?\nThere has been increasing recommendations on the internet for reproductive age women or those who are trying to conceive to take Methylated folate, also known as 5-MTHF (5-methyltetrahydrofolate). This is because some individuals may have gotten tested for MTHFR deficiency*. MTHFR is the protein that helps the body process folate, while Methylated folate is a folate supplement which is the biologically active form.\nNow, even though someone has an MTHFR gene variation, studies have shown that the body can still process all types of folate including folic acid.\nEnter Folic Acid\nIn general, it is recommended for all reproductive age women to obtain 400mcg of folic acid every day. If someone has a history of a pregnancy affected by a neural tube defect then it is recommended to consume 4000mcg of folic acid each day.\nMost importantly, folic acid is the only type of folate supplement that has been scientifically studied and proven to prevent neural tube defects. Not only is it widely accessible, but also cost-effective. Therefore, folic acid is the folate supplementation of choice in pregnancy over methylated folate.\nAs always, feel free to bring us any questions you have about supplements that are recommended and/or safe in pregnancy during your visits!\n(*In the past, there was increased screening for MTHFR gene variations/deficiency in relation to inherited thrombophilias in pregnancy and recurrent pregnancy loss. However due to lacking evidence in its significance, it is not currently recommended to screen for MTHFR gene variants/deficiency.)", "scores": {"score": 3, "score_transform_1": 5, "score_transform_2": 5, "score_transform_3": 0}}
{"id": "754", "text": "Why Foam Rolling And Stretching Isn’t Helping your client’s mobility (and what to do instead)Feb 27, 2023\nAre you finding that your clients often prefer to just skip their “mobility work?” That they just half-ass their stretching and aimlessly squish their quads, glutes and back on the foam roller without much intention? Well, I would too; that shit is boring, and there is a better way to make progress that is far more exciting for your clients as well.\nIn this article, we’ll have a look at the most common approaches to mobility, why they generally don’t work the way people want them to, and how you, as the coach, can start elevating the mobility game and start to become known as a mobility expert in your community.\nLet’s get into it!\nFoam Rolling For Mobility\nLet’s start off with foam rolling (or any variation of muscle smashing/SMR - Self Myofascial Release). See, foam rolling is often used as an attempted solution to an ongoing, seemingly endless problem. While it’s been getting a lot of heat lately for being a complete waste of time, I have my own opinions on it that I think help everyone win. There are 2 main reasons why foam rolling is such a popular approach to “improving mobility”.\n- It feels damn good (sometimes in such a painful way)\n- It offers immediate and very temporary improvements to range of motion and reduction to the perception of pain (the results here are often only present for up to 4 hours)\nBoth of these benefits are immediately gratifying, which makes it a very appealing approach. If it works so well, why wouldn’t I use it? Well, the problem isn’t that foam rolling doesn’t work; it’s just that it doesn’t work the way most people actually think it works, and their approach to foam rolling reflects that.\nFoam Rolling For Range Of Motion\nOur range of motion is governed by our nervous system. In order to create real, genuine, long-term results for our ROM and ultimately reduce the amount of unnecessary stress being placed on our joints and muscle tissue during our training, we need to have greater influence over our nervous system’s response that creates a muscular restriction in the first place. Foam rolling alone does not do this (imagine me intensely and passionately clapping in between each word here).\nThere are some fascinating concepts behind this which we won’t dive into right now (the myotatic reflex), but the most important thing to remember is that you must find a way to influence the nervous system. I know that this might sound complex at face value, but I’ve found that the simplest way to look at this is to think of it as “building trust” in the deep ranges of motion. In order to improve your range of motion for a longer period of time, you have to show the body that it can handle the deeper, funky positions you’re looking to get it into. This means you need to foster control and strength. This is exactly why the body reverts back to its previous state so quickly after foam rolling. The surface pressure of the roller offers instant feedback to the nervous system, but the body quickly realizes that no genuine change has been made.\nHow To Use Foam Rolling With Clients\nNow, I’m gonna go out on a hunch here and say that I’m pretty damn sure you’re an amazing coach, and since you’re reading this article, you are dedicated to continuing to grow and master your craft. And I know I’m right…so I also know that you want better pain reduction, ROM improvement, performance enhancement, and results for your clients. So just know that if your clients seem to enjoy foam rolling, there's absolutely no reason to take it out of their rotation. It can actually be a helpful tool in ROM progression. Just make sure you’re making efforts toward developing control and strength in the deep ranges of motion to make any real, lasting progress. The foam roller also has somewhat of a “down-regulating” effect on the nervous system that seems to calm rather than “excite”. This makes foam rolling generally a better method to be used post-workout rather than pre-workout. Either way, I won’t tell you exactly how to use it because I believe that you know your clients best and that every case deserves a unique approach, but hopefully, the facts are clear, and you understand how you can best manipulate the roller to your advantage.\nBenefits of foam rolling/muscle smashing/SMR:\n- Reduced perception of pain/physical discomfort\n- Temporarily improved range of motion\n- Temporary reduction of joint tension\n- A good tool for tissue health and maintenance\n- A great tool to help reduce DOMS and improve recovery\n*Personally, I haven’t needed to use a foam roller for years, and the majority of our clients have completely ditched theirs as they no longer feel the need for it anymore either. Improving mobility is a fantastic way to have people forget about the roller.\nOnce realizing that foam rolling is not mobility training, we can start to dive a little deeper and look at the next most popular approach that seems to have no real agenda behind it - stretching.\nStretching For Mobility\nAlright, alright, alright…don’t even think about jumping on my back about this one. If you know me at all at this point, you should already know that I’m not about to say that there are no benefits to stretching (I mean, for god's sake, I literally said there is a benefit to foam rolling, which is probably the most useless approach to improving mobility). I believe that everything has its pros and cons, and it’s how we choose to use it that dictates how effective it is. So let me clarify even more here, when I say stretching, I’m referring to static passive or dynamic passive stretching*.\nStretching For ROM\nAs previously explained above, ROM progress comes from the recognition of the nervous system that the human body can manage the deep ranges of motion. This truly only begins to happen for us when we can prove that we can control those particular positions. Maybe this could help paint the picture, how common do you think it is for someone to sit in a pigeon pose for a few minutes, stretch their hip flexors in a couch stretch, stretch their calves to open up their ankles, but still make no genuine change to their overall comfort and depth to their squat? Pretty friggin common…It isn’t until we begin applying engagement, displaying control, and developing strength in our ROM that we start to see those types of changes. Our nervous system has seen that we can handle them and trusts that we won’t get injured, so it grants us access to greater ranges. It’s simple, I like analogies to help me grasp concepts, so think of it this way - similar to how a mother will tell her children, “if you finish your plate, you can have more potatoes”, your body will tell you “if you can control your deepest range of motion, you can have more range of motion”. So I guess range of motion = potatoes…\nAs always, don’t hesitate to keep stretching into your client’s mobility protocol. It’s a very important piece of the puzzle as it will help set the stage for what needs to come next. But don’t leave it at that, you’re missing out on a lot of potato gains.\n*Static Passive = stretching a muscle(s) without actively engaging muscles and without movement (ie. classic pigeon or couch stretch)\nDynamic Passive = stretching a muscle(s) without actively engaging muscles with movement (ie. any passive flow type stretching)\nSo, let’s go a little bit further and actually give you some tools to use with your clients that will make a legitimate impact on how they feel, how they move, and how they perform. Let’s dive into a few of the individual pillars of the Primal Method, and I’ll even give you a few of our exercises so you can learn why and how you should be doing them.\nIn a world-class mobility training program, there will be multiple components that are touched on in order to offer the greatest results. *Each of these components makes up a pillar in the Primal Method (we have 5 pillars in our methodology, but I’ve taken one out for this article because all exercises should improve Awareness & Connection) and are strategically placed in order to help lay a foundation for the next. Since I’ll be discussing each component in fine detail in my next article (where I’ll teach you how to build a world-class mobility training program that actually gets your clients results), let’s just cut to the chase and have a look at some exercises you can start using to help your clients right away.\n*The Primal Method consists of 5 pillars that are strategically placed in a logical order for fluent mobility progression\n- Awareness & Connection\n- Build New Ranges\n- Movement Control\nExercises For Range Of Motion\nI probably don’t have to offer you any exercises for the Build New Ranges pillar, but I will anyway because I think the nuances of the exercises actually matter. To increase our range of motion, we’ll want to have a quick impact on the tissues and nervous system. This can be done quickly through short, isometric contractions in a technique called PNF (Proprioceptive Neuromuscular Facilitation) or through passive-based stretching (you can even do foam rolling here, but it certainly isn’t my favourite approach as it has the most marginal effect on the nervous system so the results may be limited). Even with a static passive stretching approach, it’s important to remember the intention behind what it is that you’re trying to achieve with the stretch. Most people will blindly get into a position and assume they're doing something, but there's likely a better way, so show you one classic static stretch and two PNF-based stretches.\nHere are 3 exercises that you can use to build new ranges of motion with your clients:\n- Strict Static Couch - https://youtu.be/IfmiloFE7XE\n- 2. Hip Flexor PNF: https://youtu.be/qiW_tKXeyLA\n- 3. Breathing Frog: https://youtu.be/KUQ44hmXZ0U\nExercises For Stability\nBuilding stability is often a wonderfully awful experience. This is where you first begin to communicate with the nervous system that you’re in charge and that you want to keep those stubborn ranges of motion. It’s where you first start expressing your dominance over the autonomic responses that the nervous system has spent however much time instilling. It’s tough, it’s unpleasant, and it’s amazing. Once you begin to foster stability, you lay a beautifully well-built foundation for movement control. Stability exercises are generally done in the particular ranges of motion that we want to improve and in an isometric manner. Training isometrically helps us teach our muscles to contract and engage more efficiently in the deepest ranges of motion that are often very unfamiliar. Be prepared for some shaking, complaining, and some serious burning, but to feel fantastic afterward!\nHere are 3 exercises that you can use to build ROM stability for your clients:\n- Deep Lunge Iso: https://youtu.be/PKbqZNikTF8\n- 2. Tall Frog ISO: https://youtu.be/Lojlxp1U72o\n- 3. Front Split Liftoff ISO: https://youtu.be/hjcFH9MtvVU\nExercises For Movement Control\nMovement control is the next logical step toward building strong, “bulletproof” mobility. Once you have begun communicating with the nervous system about how you plan to take over the world (at least you’ll feel that way once you start developing control), you can step your game up, elevate the stakes, and start to apply movement. With stability, we focus on isometrics to lay the foundation; in movement control, we generally focus on eccentrics, as well as deep ROM activation exercises. This further cements the influence you have over your nervous system's autonomic responses (excitability of the myotatic reflex) and helps you hold onto your results to ultimately show it whose boss (strength, what I actually mean is strength, your nervous system is still pretty much the boss, and it only allows you to do certain things once you’ve actually put the work in to prove you can handle it. We’re just a pawn in the nervous system's game).\nHere are 3 exercises that you can use to build movement control for your clients:\n- Dorsiflexion Squats: https://youtu.be/oUsc4goHsG8\n- 2. Shoulder Levers: https://youtu.be/qflmMGmOYpA\n- 3. Standing Hip CARs: https://youtu.be/oqNJ-TZw5mo\nExercises For Strength\nNow we’re really cookin’... With strength comes true opportunity. Opportunity to make sustainable changes to your “baseline” mobility. Where you will have the chance to create a new foundation for what your nervous system “reverts back to” in the future. Now your nervous system truly believes that you can handle deep ROM and will have no problem offering those ranges to you without a second thought. You’ll notice fewer restrictions, less pain/discomfort, improved positions, improved recovery, etc. It’s common for many people to not even realize how much progress they’ve made once strength is built because they will often reach a “new end-range” that provides the same “tight” feelings the old end-range did. Clients will have gained 3 inches of ROM without realizing it simply because of how smooth and fluid it feels. That’s what you want. You want it to be so good that they completely forget how bad it was in the first place. Let’s dive in.\nHere are 3 exercises that you can use to build ROM strength for your clients:\n- Hip Flexion Holds: https://youtu.be/3TANnZcH_VQ\n- 2. Ankle Reapers: https://youtu.be/FdNJZFhpPfs\n- 3. Primal Shoulder Checks: https://youtu.be/5p7PnqxAAH\nAt the end of the day, what your clients care most about is the results. How they get those results is up to you as the coach. You can keep the foam rolling and keep that passive stretching approach, but make sure you are doing more than that to offer legitimate, long-term results that your clients will rave about. It won’t necessarily make them look better naked (I mean, indirectly, it might), but it will have them feeling stronger, standing taller, feeling more confident in their body, and feeling so free that they forget they even had pain.\nIf you want to become known as the mobility expert in your gym, your community, or your industry…don’t hesitate to join us and let us show you the ways.

Yes, it’s possible.\nHowever there is a problem… you are searching at what you will sell and curious about your products. In the event you sell another person’s products? Either by purchasing legal rights or by selling through internet affiliate marketing? Or in the event you write your personal e-books and record your personal products? And should you choose the second in the event you have a course to inform you how you can create products?

Because after i answer the issue at the end of individuals questions you can respond to them yourself.\nWhat is the issue fundamentally of individuals questions? It is the question of why product creation is really important.\nSo let us start at the start. Is product creation important? Absolutely. No doubt, no argument, no alternative. It is only as essential as marketing is. Actually, I’d argue that it could be also more essential. Why? Just because a marketer can’t make a sale if they does not have almost anything to sell. Well, I suppose they might however that is frequently known as fraud. You must have an item to use marketing to market it. From the business perspective you will find three major underpinnings to each business: product creation, marketing and administration. If you wish to succeed you’ll want the 3… miss one as well as your company may ultimately fail.\nAnd if it’s that important it absolutely should be done properly along with the highest quality practices. Otherwise you’ll create low quality products. Oh, sometimes you will get lucky and make up a good product. But you’ll need a good system to create good product constantly.\nNow, at this time someone is likely to be raising the purpose of affiliate and legal rights type revenue. And the solution to that’s a word… money. You heard right… the dollar, the lire, the euro, the pound. Whatever currency you apply the answer comes lower to money. Selling affiliate products and programs and legal rights products are a way to earn money initially. Selling affiliate products and programs could even be a great way to make extra cash lengthy term. Legal rights goods are an awful idea lengthy term — and perhaps even temporary. But if you wish to really, really make a nice income in information publishing and marketing you must have your personal product.

In the end, you are not wishing to achieve a status like a used vehicle salesperson are you currently? No, you’re most likely searching to construct a status according to your knowledge of your subject. And unless of course you’re giving your personal information out how will you be prepared to prove your abilities to other people?\nGetting your personal product may also help you to definitely sell product. Why? Because individuals buy simply because they as if you. When they as if you they are more inclined to purchase your product than another person’s. In the end, if you’re creating your products then that method is a good example of you and also what you are.

{"id": "762", "text": "Estimated taxes are tax payments made by self-employed individuals. The IRS requires most of your tax liability to be paid by the due date. W-2 employees, most of the time, can satisfy this requirement by having the relevant taxes withheld from each paycheck, while self-employed individuals and business owners make estimated payments throughout the year.\nIf you are self-employed or receive income with no withholdings, you likely need to make estimated tax payments. In addition to self-employment income, receiving income from the following sources requires estimated tax payments:\nInvestment income – such as from a rental property\nPartnership or S co\nent distributions (From certain retirement accounts)\nUnemployment income where you choose to have no withholdings\nIt is important to note that if you are a W-2 employee and receive income that has no withholdings, you will need to send estimated tax payments for the non-W-2 income.\nIf your income is relatively constant year to year, the simplest way to calculate your estimated tax payments is to take the previous year’s tax liability and divide by four. Because your income remains steady each year, the previous year’s tax bill should come very close to this year’s tax bill.\nFor example, suppose you are a tradesman or skilled laborer whose tax bill for the last four years has been $40,000. In this case, you would take the $40,000 and divide it by four, and make four equal payments of $10,000 to satisfy your tax requirements for this year. If you think you may earn a little more this year, it is a good idea to use 110% of the previous year’s bill, which would be $44,000.\nIf your income varies from year to year, another method to calculate your estimated tax is to use your earnings in the year so far.\nFor example, suppose you have a skilled labor or tradesman business and you calculate you owe $5,000 for the first estimated payment. You could use the $5,000 as a baseline to calculate your next payment and make any necessary adjustments as you get more information.\nEstimated taxes are made quarterly. Here is the schedule for 2023.\nFirst payment due – April 18, 2023\nSecond payment due – June 15, 2023\nThird payment due – September 15, 2023\nFourth payment due – January 15, 2024\nThese dates are not ironclad. Stay up-to-date on tax deadlines with our new digital tax calendar that syncs directly with the calendar tool you already use.\nMany taxpayers find it easier to make payments more often. For example, if you are a busy tradesman and prefer making smaller payments more often, you can send tax payments each month.\nLet’s walk through a detailed example to show the entire process of calculating estimated taxes. Suppose Bob is a self-employed tradesman who uses skilled labor to complete client projects. Bob estimates he will earn $100,000 this year because his income has been around this amount the last five years.\nAfter taking all his deductions, Bob calculates his taxable income at $70,000. Bob next multiplies his taxable income by his marginal tax rate to arrive at his tax liability.\nBob is a single filer, so his marginal tax rate is 22%. $70,000*.22 = $15,400. Bob’s estimated tax liability is $15,400. Bob wants to pay taxes quarterly, so he will send the quarterly IRS payments of $3,850 no later than by the relevant deadlines.\nOrganization is important in all aspects of business, especially so when calculating your estimated tax payments. Updating your books regularly to ensure income and expenses are accurate and current is a great way to take some of the stress out of making quarterly payments.\nStaying organized also helps avoid penalties from the IRS for incorrect or late tax payments. Even if you have a refund coming, the IRS can charge you penalties for late or incorrect payments.\nOne benefit of making estimated tax payments is that the payments can smooth out your cash flow throughout the year. Making quarterly payments of $2,500 each over the course of the year is likely preferable to making a $10,000 payment by the April tax deadline.\nThis can be important for a seasonal tradesman or skilled labor business.\nAs a busy service-based business owner, you know how busy tax season can get.

{"id": "846", "text": "4 June 2021\nHow I take photos\nTaking photos has made me pay more attention to my surroundings when I travel. I noticed details I would have overlooked. Inevitably, I end up spending a significant amount of time in any given spot – at least much more than the duration “recommended” by travel books. Over time, my photography skills have improved too: I’m a good amateur, but a far cry from being a pro even if I get a rough sense of the areas I need to pay more attention to. But maybe I’m just making up excuses!\nWith 130,000 photos taken over the past 15 years, my organisation system has remained robust; I even considered hiring someone to focus on the sale of my best shots since I had some preliminary data that this endeavour could be profitable. I still spend too much time organising and not enough enjoying though – a classic dilemma that I try to address in an article on trade-offs that I haven’t managed to finalise and publish in months.\nHaving said that, I do try to give a (second) life to those photos by embedding them in my stories. I would either have an idea for a story and then find the best photos in my collection to illustrate it, or I would go through my photos of a particular location and they would nudge me towards writing “something” about them. That “something” isn’t always straightforward. Some research (on the history, the culture, the people) however does help in getting a story to take seed in my mind.\nAnother way to keep my photos alive is to talk about my shooting process. I could limit myself to explaining my photographic decisions (composition, settings) after the fact. However, Nigel Danson’s videos inspired me to take it a step further and do the explanation in the field i.e. as I’m about to take a shot. Now that is obviously a little more complicated to set up, since it requires me to use a microphone and have something interesting to say even though I’m improvising. It’s a good way to share tips as well. Have a look at that first try and let me know what you think:\nI quite enjoyed recording and editing this video: it’s a pleasant combination of photography, videography and giving a talk. In general, I believe there’s a lot of value for anyone to see how others do things, in all domains. After all, that’s how I learned the ukulele. I was about to add “on my own” but that’s technically not correct since my teachers were plenty of different ones who took the time to publish videos on YouTube.\nMany projects await me at the intersection of training and video. I’ll likely continue to dabble in different genres and topics before settling on a few (ideally one, but I find it tough to reign myself in).

{"id": "863", "text": "Having stinky feet can be an embarrassing and confidence-damaging issue. The smell is often hard to conceal and can make you dread taking your shoes off in front of others. Fortunately, with the right foot hygiene regimen, anyone can learn how to get rid of stinky feet for good. This article outlines the underlying causes of smelly feet and provides useful tips and solutions to eliminate foot odor permanently.\nWhat Causes Stinky Feet?\nWhen your feet start to smell unpleasant, the likely culprit is bacteria. Our feet contain more sweat glands per square inch than any other part of the body. When feet sweat, which is perfectly normal and healthy, the moisture gets trapped against the skin by socks and shoes. This warm, damp environment encourages bacteria to thrive.\nAs the bacteria rapidly multiply, they start to break down sweat into acids. These acids produce the unpleasant smells we associate with unpleasant foot odor. Certain feet are more prone to sweating and developing bacteria than others due to genetic factors. However, with diligent hygiene, even the sweatiest feet can be odor-free.\nTips to Get Rid of Smelly Feet\nPractice Proper Hygiene\nThe first step is thoroughly washing and drying your feet daily. Use a mild antibacterial soap and wash between the toes where moisture and bacteria tend to accumulate. After washing, dry feet carefully, especially between the toes. Remaining dampness encourages bacterial overgrowth.\nFoot soaks are an easy way to clean feet, kill bacteria and soften calluses. Combine a basin of warm water with antifungal ingredients like apple cider vinegar, black tea, sage or essential oils like eucalyptus, peppermint, and tea tree. Soak feet for 15-20 minutes daily to reduce foot odor.\nGently sloughing off dead skin cells keeps feet fresh. Use a foot scrub or pumice stone to exfoliate while soaking feet to remove calluses and cleared clogged pores that can cause odor.\nWear Moisture-Wicking Socks\nWear socks made from moisture-wicking fabrics like wool, bamboo rayon, polyester, and spandex blends. These fabrics draw sweat away from feet to keep them dry and discourage bacterial growth. Change into a fresh pair halfway through the day if your feet are excessively sweaty.\nUse Antiperspirant Spray\nApplying an over-the-counter antiperspirant spray to clean feet and shoes can curb sweating and odor. Look for aluminum chloride as the active ingredient. Reapply daily, especially before exercising when sweat production increases.\nGive your shoes at least 24 hours to fully dry out before wearing again. Rotate between different pairs to allow them to air out and reduce odor-causing moisture and bacteria buildup.\nReplace Old Shoes and Socks\nFabric shoes and socks develop odors over time and should be replaced every six months – or sooner if they smell unpleasant even after washing. Old, degraded materials allow for more bacterial growth. Invest in new supportive, breathable shoes and high-quality socks.\nTry Antifungal Treatments\nIf excessive foot sweating and odor persists, over-the-counter antifungal sprays, powders and creams can help. Products with miconazole or clotrimazole work to control fungi and bacteria. Apply twice daily, including between the toes until sweat and smells dissipate.\nSee a Podiatrist or Dermatologist\nFor severe, untreatable foot odor, make an appointment with a foot doctor or skin doctor. You may have a underlying condition like hyperhidrosis (excessive sweating) or a fungal infection causing uncontrollable smells. Prescription-strength antiperspirants and antifungals are available to curb foot odor.\nIf prescription treatments are not an option, try homemade foot odor remedies:\n- Baking soda foot baths neutralize foot odor\n- Dab apple cider vinegar between toes and let dry to kill bacteria\n- Apply a thin layer of plain yogurt between toes before bed – the enzymes eat odor-causing particles\n- Dust feet and shoes with cornstarch or baby powder to absorb moisture\n- Place tea bags soaked in vinegar in shoes overnight to absorb odors\nWith discipline, the right footwear and consistent hygiene, you can say goodbye to smelly feet for good. Don’t let foot odor diminish your confidence. Implement these dermatologist-recommended tips today to keep your feet fresh, healthy and odor-free all year long.", "scores": {"score": 3, "score_transform_1": 5, "score_transform_2": 5, "score_transform_3": 0}}

{"id": "960", "text": "Buying a house is a major life purchase and, given the significance of this purchase, just the idea of buying a house may generate many questions and some anxiety. One factor you may consider when buying a house is the economy and how it affects your future. While no one can predict the future, understanding more about how the economy works may help reduce some anxiety by providing a larger context for the world around us.\nThe following 30-minute video explains how the economy works. It was produced by Ray Dalio, the founder of one of the world’s largest hedge funds. Ray is someone I follow, not simply because of his business success, but rather because of the thinking it is built upon. He strives to understand our economic and financial world and has a reputation as an out-of-the-box thinker that sees “what is” when others don’t. This thinking helped his firm predict the 2008 financial crisis, which allowed them to proactively manage a better outcome rather than be caught off-guard and be reactive like many of us. Regardless of your education level or familiarity with economics, I think you will find this Economics 101 video worth a watch…\nEconomics 101 — “How the Economic Machine Works.”\nCreated by Ray Dalio this simple but not simplistic and easy to follow 30 minute, animated video answers the question, “How does the economy really work?” Based on Dalio’s practical template for understanding the economy, which he developed over the course of his career, the video breaks down economic concepts like credit, deficits and interest rates, allowing viewers to learn the basic driving forces behind the economy, how economic policies work and why economic cycles occur.\nTo learn more about Economic Principles visit: http://www.economicprinciples.org.\nFor many of us the decision to buy or sell a home has nothing to do with the economy — it may originate from life events like having kids and needing more space, or landing a new job, or retiring, or just wanting to live somewhere different for no reason at all. And for those that do buy or sell real estate due to economic considerations, it often has more to do with the deal dynamics and strategy than what the market is doing. In that scenario, understanding how the economy works can be quite beneficial.\nIf you or someone you know has an interest in buying or selling real estate, please contact me to learn more about the current housing market and your options.

{"id": "962", "text": "Viya woke up one day, afraid of the shadows. They always followed Viya. Where she went, they were there. Viya was afraid. One day, Viya woke up and saw there wasn’t a shadow. Viya was afraid. Viya wondered where the shadow went. It was bright, so why wasn’t there a shadow? Where did the shadow go? Viya looked for the shadow, behind Viya, under Viya’s bed, in the closet. But the shadow wasn’t there. Viya looked all day. Viya couldn’t see the shadow. Viya was afraid. Viya went to bed. Viya woke up and saw the shadow under Viya. Viya was afraid. Where did the shadow go? Why was the shadow back? Viya realized it was better when the shadow wasn’t there. But now it was too late. The shadow was back. Viya was afraid. The shadow followed Viya to the closet, under her bed, and to the kitchen! The shadow wanted Viya to be afraid. The shadow didn’t let go of Viya. Other shadows followed Viya too. There was always a shadow following Viya. Viya was afraid the shadows could hurt Viya. One day, Viya woke up and the shadows hurt Viya. Viya was bleeding. The shadow wasn’t there.\nI’m also confused. Why did I wrote this thing?\nThere was a little lamb, lost in a meadow.\nTreading behind it was another lamb, bigger than the first one. It gnaws those little buds of flowers and grasses. Crunching here and there while still following the first one. Not too far from them was another bigger lamb—a sheep, cause it looks bigger you know? It was accompanied by two more sheeps.\n'So how many were there again?'\n'There are five of them! right?'\n'So now there are five, how many more can be added to make it called a herd?'\n'I don't know mom! You didn't tell me anything about that!'\n'Okay....If you add 45 more sheeps in it, how many are there now?'\n'Ummm...45 sheeps and 5 sheeps!—wait a second! Isn't the lamb lost? Why is no one looking for it?'\n'I don't know either honey, the textbook didn't say anything about it AHEM—okay next.'\nThe meadow spans wide in an open field of a mountain called sheepland, derived from the word sheep because sheeps are pastured there.\n'That sounds stupid! Who named that??'\n'I haven't even asked my question yet, let me ask first'\n'Let me guess! The answer is shitland!'\n'No it's not, so how many sheeps have you counted so far?'\n'Ah!... Ummm five!'\n'Where did the 45 sheeps go then?'\n'I already finished counting it so I restarted counting to five'\n'Uhuh so aren't you sleepy now then?'\n'But she hadn't finished counting yet!'\n'She? Who's she? Who are you talking to?'\n'That lady over there!'—\n\"OH FUCK! THAT'S WHAT I GET WHEN I COUNT SHEEPS TO SLEEP!\"\nI struggled to catch my breath as I looked around the porch and on the grassland in front, heart still beating fast, looking for the sheeps that I didn't finish counting.\nOriginal title: the logic behind the math for comfortable sleeping\nWritten by my drowsy self who haven't had any proper sleep lately.\nOutside some Publix\nThick air foamed into filled pores of sticky skin. Johanne Murloft grasped her two thin shopping bags, seething from the several bottles of spring water and a hot rotisserie chicken. The warm cooked stream didn't help quell the Florida heat that now surged above its usual 95 degrees. She made a beeline to her car, holding the bag of chicken in her arm to seal its hot contents from stinging her skin. The ride was a mid-sized Subaru with a white coat and peach plates. It blinked at her keys. With little thought, she flipped open the trunk and threw her quick dinner purchase into the back before closing it and taking a seat at the wheel.\nThe inside reached its usual molasses consistency air from the ten minutes it sat below the growing mushroom clouds. Johanne slightly cursed to herself about the possibility of the car being in the shade if she'd just waited a little later for the coming shower. She would've gotten soaked, but it beat the burning feeling when she grasped her hands to the sun baked steering wheel. She turned the keys and brought her fingers to the air conditioning.\nIn that moment, the most inexplicable phenomena skirted past her corner of vision. It was a dark shape, growing till it engulfed her passenger window. Before she took her fingers off the knob, her heart leaped. The unexpected sound of her front door opening brought her to a jump just as a tall female figure plopped into the seat beside her. The stranger had entered like they were escaping from a robbery. Enough for Johanne to shrink back to the other side of the car, thinking she was getting attacked. She barely mustered back a yelp. But not before the woman spoke.\n\"Alright hon, those cuts aren't going to eat themselves.\"\n\"Adam's Rib co, it's closing in an hour, let's get moving.\"\nJohanne sat there speechless. She'd returned to her former position at her seat. The stranger's voice bellowed in a way that snapped her into attention. Though she realized she wasn't getting attacked, the stranger's size was enough to keep her from taking liberties with further arm room. Sitting beside her was a seven foot tall woman that weighed at least two hundred pounds. She had long black hair and wore what Johanne could only register as some sort of gothic stage clothes. No matter how much she racked her brains, Johanne was sure she'd never seen her before.\n\"Uh... ma'am, I think you have the wrong car.\"\n\"Nah, this is the right one. Come on, let's get going.\"\n\"I'm not an Uber.\"\nThe hairs on Johanne's neck spiked. Sweat poured down the small of her back. Distant thunder came from the west as she waited for a response.\n\"I didn't say you were an Uber. I said we're going to Adam's Rib co. Come on, let's go!\"\n\"Ma'am, please get out of my car.\"\nJohanne's gut flipped when the stranger turned to her. Her sweat gushed down quicker. She desperately wanted to turn on the AC as the car's thick heat continued to wet her neck. While nothing sickly came through in the woman's face, Johanne turned to theories of drugs or some mental illness. The woman seemed mildly annoyed rather than infuriated much to Johanne's relief. Then came the next wave of discomfort. The woman didn't answer Johanne's retort. Instead, she continued the annoyed glance like Johanne had been rude to her.\n\"Are you serious right now? You don't want the Rib to Go? The full slab rib with barbeque sauce that melts in your mouth like butter? Don't tell me you ate already.\"\n\"Get out of my car.\"\n\"We could always share the Adam's Delight special if you just want the Pudding and Wafers.\"\n\"I'm not going to Adam's Rib co!\"\nJohanne's assertive response hadn't moved the stranger in her seat. Neither had it shifted the woman's hand that was too close to the AC knob for Johanne to make any moves. Johanne thought of pushing her, but realized that was nearly impossible because of the woman's size. She had no time to repeat herself before the stranger blurted out again.\n\"Oh yes, you are!\"\n\"Because this is your destiny baby! The universe has aligned us to be right here right now and for you to drive us to Adam's Rib co to order the Rib to Go while I talk to you about how cheese bites are objectively better than fried okra and how Brian Jones was actually murdered and Mic Jagger and Keith Richards are in on it while you ignore my conversation and instead remark about how quickly that Target across the street go boarded up and that your angry about no longer having it...”\nJohanne thought she would've left the car, but she stood her ground. In a flash of confused rage she gathered up the courage to give the woman a good shove. The stranger laughed at her advance like Johanne was nothing but a sister rough housing with her. Johanne fiddled through her purse for a vial of pepper spray in case things got uglier. She was about to exit the vehicle to pull the assailant out when disaster struck. A crisp bolt of lightning illuminated the Publix parking lot before it poured. In seconds, the surroundings became white with dense rain.\n\"I'm not getting out of here.\"\nThe woman reclined in the seat after she said it in a shrugging tone. Seconds became hours for Johanne as she prayed for the rain to only last for less than a minute. It didn't. Instead, the woman just lay facing the ceiling, looking like she was about to take a nap. Johanne took out her phone from her purse and waved it at the woman.\n\"I'm calling the cops if you don't move it.\"\n\"Whatever, man. I don't know why your freaking out so much.\"\nJohanne wasn't sure to be confused, furious, or scared when the woman responded sleepily while still gazing at the ceiling. The rain was showing no signs of slowing down. She schemed of making a move once it stopped, but the wait was deafening. All she could do was sit there, helpless, as this intruder made home of her rightful domain.\n\"Are we goin or not?\"\nThe stranger said this in the same relaxed tone. It only added fuel to Johanne's growing rage. In that moment, her loathing came to a peak. She shoved open the door. A blast of warm rain drenched her Cocoa beach T-shirt and jean shorts. Her toes felt the rushing streams of water that lapped over her sandals as she trudged to the passenger door. The woman snapped around in surprise when Johanne pulled it open and grabbed her by the arm.\n\"Hey come on now, don't choose hate.\"\nSmall hands wrapped around the thick wrist of the stranger. It was like trying to pull a horse. Johanne tugged and growled as rain soaked her through her underwear. She could not see the figure in the care through the water streaming into her eyes, only that she was pulling with all her might. The woman's voice came to her again, now pleading through the rushing shower.\n\"Please! Please! Just let me help you. You need to let it go. You need to complain about the Target as we're driving down the street to Adam's Rib co and then point to the old Krispy Kreme at the next intersection and say how bad their donuts are as I turn on baseball at full blast as we go past the knife sharpening center and pull into the Adam's Rib co parking lot.

She only thought of winning and slowly realizing she was fighting a losing battle. Her arms had become wet and tired as the woman remained in the vehicle nearly unsoaked, bested by a stranger that did nothing but sit firmly in her seat. Johanne let out one last shriek in frustration before glaring at her passenger. Their eyes locked.\n\"Don't you want it? The answer to your life's most difficult questions. The power to achieve perpetual enlightenment?\"\nSmall divots of blue appeared in the sky ahead. The white sheet of rain dissipated to a spit drizzle. Johanne saw and heard these last words, not sure what came before them and not caring. She grumbled and put her hands to her head before putting them back to her sides to reattach her glare to the stranger, in one bitter hiss she said.\n\"Yes, we're going to Adam's fuckin Rib co!\"\nThe stranger smiled and made a joyous clap.\n\"Heck yeah!

{"id": "1009", "text": "Dr. Stan Wafler PhD\nStan and his wife, Pam, lived in Arua, Uganda, from 2001-2015. They served in a variety disciple-making roles, including Bible translation consulting, orality training, pastor training, marriage encouragement ministry, expository preaching training, and student ministry.\nI would like to invite you to join me on my African journey of engaging language and culture. The journey was full of challenges and victories. The investment of becoming an intentional student of language and culture was well worth the effort. My desire is that you may benefit from some of the lessons I learned along the way.\nOne rite of passage to become an effective missionary is language and culture learning. Language and culture learning may take place in a structured classroom setting or with informal local tutors. The language learning reality often seems to be a combination of the above. Regardless of the learning environment the attitude of the learner and awareness of the opportunities afforded him are critical. There is a definite journey from confidence in your home culture to humility in your new target culture that sets the stage for effective ministry and growing confidence. My own journey was enhanced by an introduction to orality before I went to the field and orality sensitive mentoring along the way.\nI served in various church staff roles and as a senior pastor before we were appointed to serve in East Africa in 2000. I remember the uncomfortable thought of my own uselessness dawning on me about six weeks into our African adventure. Virtually everything about my identity failed to transfer to my new African context. I realized within the short time of two international flights I had been reduced to a mere childlike proficiency in the most basic task areas. I needed instructions about bathing and buying tomatoes, washing clothes, and transportation. I experienced the vulnerability that comes with realizing I needed toilet training as well.\nWhat I had known in my former life seemed irrelevant in my new African setting. One morning as I woke up in central Tanzania and looked out of my tent, I realized that I was living in a place where my proficiencies were extremely limited. Recognizing my own uselessness was actually helpful for the process I call role surrender. For me role surrender meant setting aside my previous proficiencies, confidence, credentials, and yes even my pride to decide to become a humble learner. This was a painful but significant valley that led to opportunities to discover a new identity and new proficiencies based on language and culture learning.\nI cannot speak of painful adjustments made for the sake of culture and language\nwithout mentioning the model of Jesus, the ultimate missionary. Philippians describes the\npurposeful but painful descent of Jesus to leave behind his rightful role as Lord of the universe, enter our world, and participate in our culture and language in order to communicate.\n\"Have this mind among yourselves, which is yours in Christ Jesus, who, though he was in the form of God, did not count equality with God a thing to be grasped, but emptied himself, by taking the form of a servant, being born in the likeness of men. And being found in human form, he humbled himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross.\" (Philippians 2:5-8)\nOne of the ways Jesus accommodated his audience was to engage the oral culture in\nwhich he lived. Of course, Jesus could have chosen any communication style but more often than not he employed narratives, asked questions, and recited parables (Mark 4:34). Rather than delivering lofty lectures on theology, Jesus connected with His audience by teaching truth using stories from daily life. The model of Jesus motivated me to consider setting aside my comfort, my communication preferences and my literate expositional style. The choice to start thinking about the oral preference learners around me was presented to me by passionate mentors who demonstrated the use of oral methods at home and in ministry settings. With these models in view, I began discipling my children with oral Bible stories in the evenings. I also decided I would take each invitation offered me to share, speak, or preach as an opportunity to model telling a story from God’s Word.\nOnce I realized that I could not maintain my familiar home culture role and that I\nneeded to discover the new role I needed to fill in my target culture two significant questions arose:\n1) What do I need to learn?\n2) How do I learn it?\nWhen you are entering a new culture you need to learn to communicate but equally important is the task of learning who you are communicating with and how to build relational bridges for your message. You might say that you could make this massive transition from the person you used to be to the person you are trying to become by employing only literate communication patterns and disregarding the notion of orality. However, there were certain benefits to be gained from choosing to acknowledge and engage the oral preference culture around me. Orality became like a new cultural language pattern for me that opened up new worlds of discovery. Awareness of the oral culture around me allowed me to see opportunities to become a learner and listener and\nset aside my previous role as an expert outsider.\nOrality provided opportunities for learning, participation, contextualization, interpretation, creativity, and the discovery of the uniqueness and beauty of the local language. After laying this basic foundation, next time I will share some practical applications to the ways that oral methodologies provided various opportunities for communication that encourages going deeper in a local language and culture.\nVANCE PITTMAN - GUEST BLOG\nUsed with permission from Vance Pitman and the IMB. www.imb.org/2017/05/23/missions-must-be-accomplished-in-community/\nThe notion of following Jesus outside of community has been steadily gaining popularity in the United States over the last decade and a half. Digital downloads of Sunday services are on the rise across the United States. Increasingly, believers are opting for “the virtual option” as opposed to gathering together with brothers and sisters in Christ to hear the Word preached and to worship him together.\nLet’s face it, fellowship is inconvenient and messy. It’s easier to choose a podcast over face-to-face encounters with people who actually know us. The temptation to avoid relationships, both in and outside of our churches, is not only real, it’s not going away soon.\nThe modern world might be making faith a private endeavor, but the picture of faith in Scripture couldn’t be more different. The early church, in Acts 2:42-47, could not get enough of studying, breaking bread, praying, meeting needs, worshiping, celebrating, visiting, hosting, and being on mission together. They were enthusiastic for both the preaching of the Word and fellowship in the body of Christ—to the point, in fact, that it could be said that the New Testament knows nothing of Christianity without community.\nIn his Word, God not only encourages fellowship but calls it out as an authentic mark of following him. Ironically, the very thing that God has called a necessity—fellowship in a local body—is something that too many are viewing as merely an option.\nGod not only encourages fellowship but calls it out as an authentic mark of following him.\nWhen I think about how critical fellowship is in the life of the healthy church, my mind turns to thinking strategically. I wonder how we encourage biblical fellowship in our churches. It may be possible that we do a great job of teaching how much the local church needs its members, but are slack in our teaching about the important ways in which the Bible says believers need their own spiritual family. I’d like to share three realities that I think require us to both live and teach the necessity of following Jesus in fellowship with other believers as we join in his mission.\n1) We need others to help us grow in intimacy with God.\nThe New Testament makes clear that Christian community is an indispensable part of biblical discipleship. That truth can be difficult to hear, however. Western culture (and in particular, American culture) has been heavily influenced by individualism and consumerism—baggage that, if we’re not careful, we can bring into our churches.\nWhile it may be common to show up on Sunday searching for information or programs that we think will help us grow in our walk with Jesus, it’s important to remember that God says the most significant part of our growth in intimacy with him happens in relationship with others. As the Proverbs remind us, “Iron sharpens iron and one man sharpens another” (Proverbs 27:17, ESV).\nThere are things about God that we will never learn apart from relationships with other believers. Living our lives together exposes our faults and allows others to speak truth into our lives. It can be messy, confusing, and painful at times, but the blessing we experience as we obey this command of God’s far outweighs any of those obstacles.\n2) We need others to help us walk through the ups and downs of life.\nIn Paul’s description of the marks of a true Christian found in Romans 12:9-21, he urges us to rejoice with those who rejoice and to weep with those who weep (Romans 12:15, ESV). We cannot obey this command without being in community. If believers are commanded to rejoice and weep with one another, the implication is that there are going to be times when our joys need amplification and our sorrows need distribution. True humility involves a willingness to say both “God, I need you,” and “God, I need others.”\nThe mission of God has always existed in the context of community.\n3) We need others to help us accomplish the mission.\nThe mission of God has always existed in the context of community. This fact is displayed in the most basic element of the gospel: God the Father sent God the Son to be “Savior of the World” (1 John 4:14, ESV). When Jesus ascended from the earth, he charged his followers to take the gospel to the entire world. What’s more, he didn’t just say it once—he said it five times, and each time, his commission was in the context of a group of believers. The New Testament pattern for community assumes mission, and the New Testament pattern for mission assumes community.\nNowadays, the word fellowship has expanded to mean any of a number of ways of connecting with people—some real and some that we euphemistically call “virtual.” In an era when virtual commutes and relational distance are real-life concepts, it’s important to remember that face-to-face fellowship in the local church is not merely an option for Jesus’ followers, but, rather, an imperative.\nBecause we have a relationship with Jesus, we now have a relationship with his family. And, just as our relationship with Jesus is central to our lives, so should be our relationship with his family. Our position in Christ has never been up for debate. Why should our place in His body be? Not only does my church need me, but, if I’m a follower of the living Christ, I need my church as well. If we are going to accomplish the work into which we’ve been sent, we must do it together.\nVance Pitman is the Senior Pastor of Hope Church in Las Vegas, NV. As a seasoned church planter who has commissioned more than 40 churches, and now as a national mobilizer for NAMB, Vance seeks to promote awareness that the gospel is very needed in the United States as well as all over the world. He and his wife, Kristie, have two sons, two daughters, a son-in-law, and one grandchild on the way.\nIn our last blog, we closed by posing several questions:\nIn this blog, we address the first of these, albeit in an abbreviated fashion. For fuller consideration and treatment of these topics, please consult the resources available through the Newbigin Center for the Study of Indigenous Missions (www.unfinishedtask.org/resources).\nConversion is worldview shift, meaning that cross-cultural evangelism is essentially an effort to introduce change into a specific culture. As a result, it is helpful to consider what is meant by culture. In ordinary speech we use the term “culture” to refer to the behavior of the rich and famous. It is listening to Bach, Beethoven and Brahms, having the proper taste for good clothes, and knowing which fork to use at a banquet. However, anthropologists in their study of mankind in all parts of the world and all levels of society, have broadened the concept of “culture” and freed it from value judgments, such as good and bad. A good working definition is the one proposed by Paul G. Hiebert: “Culture is the more or less integrated system of learned patterns of behavior, ideas and products characteristic of a society.” Another way of stating this is to say that culture is the learned part of man’s environment.\nWe learn about culture by observing the behavior of people and looking for patterns in that behavior. For example, two North American men when meeting each other usually shake hands, while Hispanics embrace, the French kiss one another’s cheeks, Indians put hands together and raise them towards their foreheads with slight bow of the head, and Suriano men of South America spit on each other’s chest when meeting. Culture is not inherited, but it is learned. In other words, an ethnic Chinese raised in an African environment would act, think and speak as an African. An Anglo child raised in an Indian environment would act, think and speak as an Indian. This process of learning a culture is called enculturation.\nCultures are made up of a great many patterns of behavior, ideas and products, but is more than the sum of them. These patterns are integrated into larger cultural complexes and into total cultural systems.\nHiebert asks if his readers have noticed that Americans have an obsession with platforms (chairs)? He goes on to say that this North American peculiarity may be regularly observed in airports as U. S. travelers uncomfortably drape themselves over chairs in airports while most others sit or lie comfortably on the floor. Behind this pattern of behavior is a basic assumption that the ground and floor are dirty, explaining why we keep our shoes on when we enter a house/building. For a North American, when food touches the ground, it instantly becomes dirty, no matter how clean the floor is. The exception is the unofficial three-second-rule invoked by a number of households, mine being one of them. On the other hand, Asians believe the floor is clean. They take their shoes off at the door, sleep on mats, and eat squatting on floor. These basic assumptions that people have about the nature of reality and of right and wrong, are all integrated into ‘worldview.’ This linkage between cultural traits and their integration into a larger system have important implications for those who seek to introduce change into a culture. Culture abhors a vacuum. When changes are made in one are of culture, changes will occur in other areas of the culture, often in unpredictable ways. A classic example of this may be seen in the low budget film, “The Gods Must Be Crazy” – in which a Coca Cola bottle finds its way into Bushmen of Botswana, resulting in selfishness, ownership, jealousy, anger, etc.\nIn our next entry, we consider in more detail the implications of such cultural differences for Evangelism and church planting.\nThe word indigenous means \"originating or occurring naturally in a particular place; native.\" The term is often used in mission circles to describe the proper aim of missionary endeavor. Henry Venn and Rufus Anderson, two missionary statesmen, initiated the modern concept of the indigenous church. In their view, the goal of missions was planting the Church through preaching the gospel, cultivating leadership, and developing indigenous churches. They articulated a 'three-self' formula to describe an indigenous church: self-governing, self-supporting, and self-propagating. The Venn/Anderson model of missions offered a radical departure from the old paradigm. Later, John Nevius, an American missionary to China and Korea, developed a similar strategy of indigenous methods known as the “Nevius Plan,” which stressed the three-self formula, but added an emphasis on laity training. Roland Allen, an Anglican missionary to China and East Africa, wrote Missionary Methods: St. Paul’s or Ours? (1921), in which he offered a revolutionary element to the indigenous church philosophy. In church planting strategy, the word indigenous can be applied to the planter or to the church. If applied to the planter, indigenous means that the church planter is from the people group and context in which the church is being planted. If applied to the church, indigenous means that the church members, leadership and forms of the new church largely reflect the people group and context in which the church is being planted. Indigenous churches govern, teach, support and reproduce themselves with local, “home grown” leadership rather than with non-indigenous leadership brought in from outside the context of the new church plant. The goal of indigenous church planting strategy is always to start churches that reflect the cultural and worldview context of the Christians in the new church.\nBy definition, indigenous church planting among unreached peoples is always, at least initially, a cross-cultural process, simply because there are no believers among the people to launch the effort. Cross-cultural evangelism and church planting is largely about recognizing and identifying walls. The different walls within which people live are not physical ones made of stone or brick; they are invisible, yet they determine our values (right and wrong). There are three basic value systems that enclose people:\n1. Social System - traditions/customs that determine how people behave.\n2. Cultural System – what holds people together as a unit.\n3. Beliefs System – people’s religious beliefs.\nOur task is primarily one of communication that takes into account these walls, but refuses to leave people behind them where they are shielded from the Gospel. We are to proclaim the good news and victory in Jesus in such a way that people who are walled in by their social customs, cultural forms, and religious beliefs, and enslaved by sin and evil, can hear and understand what we’re talking about. Only when they understand are they ready to respond to the love of Christ.\nIn other words, our task is not to fight against systems, but to communicate effectively within them. For example, a great deal of evangelism is taking place in India. There are 13 million Christians in a nation of 1 billion; however, a large percentage of these Christians are drawn from tribal societies rather than mainstream Hinduism. The Christian church has largely been ineffective in penetrating the citadel of Hinduism, with the past exception of Sadhu Sundar Singh. Various teams are going out with gospel literature all across the country of India. Gospel programs are broadcast in most of the major languages of India. But for some reason, and for the most part, the Christian message is not penetrating into the minds and hearts of Hindus. Obviously, an essential element is missing, one that effectively communicates the Good News of Christ so that Hindus hear, understand, believe and obey, without feeling forced to scale unnatural or \"foreign\" obstacles in the process. E. Stanley Jones called this encountering \"the Christ of the Indian road.\"\nIn our next blog, we will consider the following questions related to cross-cultural evangelism and church planting:", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

This paper analyzes the existing sex education curriculums in relation to their effectiveness at improving teenage sexual health, measured by a decrease in teenage pregnancy and STI rates. In response to a gap in the literature, I developed the Intercullutrally Competent Sex Education Framework, a tiered system of sex education that standardizes existing and future research on sex education. This framework also contributes an important factor to the topic, the lens through which sex education topics are approached. This analysis demonstrates a need for sex education standardization on a federal level to produce not only a minimum level of sex education that includes contraception usage, STIs, and LGBTQ+ to all high school-aged teens, but an inclusive and equitable approach to these topics. A more holistic and statistical-based approach is necessary to draw a clearer picture of how effective each tier of sex education is at curbing teen pregnancy and STIs, particularly for members of marginalized gender, sexuality, educational, racial, and economic groups.", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

Michael Jones, is a brilliant and erudite man. Some consider him America’s leading Catholic intellectual. Dr. Jones strikes me as smarter and more Catholic than the Pope—though that could be because Francis plays the holy fool in public while saving his incisive analysis, including his real thoughts about the Jews, for the privacy of the papal boudoir. (That’s why Francis is pope while E-Mike co-hosts False Flag Weekly News.)\nWhile Dr. Jones and I have our theological differences, we agree on most things. We used to disagree about “the Jews”—I thought it was an oversimplified and rhetorically counterproductive epithet, instead opting for “Zionists,” while he insisted that you can’t win without accurately identifying your enemy. By the Jews Dr. Jones means the Jewish tribal power configuration rooted in Jewish ideology—“not all Jews” as he repeatedly points out.\nThe more I learn about Jewish ideological history, the more I realize that E. Michael Jones is right: The phenomenon of Zionism, with all the evil associated with it, is the product of Jewish ideology, and to defeat it we do indeed need to “blame the Jews,” meaning the active carriers of the ideological virus. It’s no accident that here in the Arab world, which has had a front row seat for the bloody 75-year spectacle of the genocide of Palestine, the terms yahood (Jew) and sahyuni (Zionist) are pretty much interchangeable.\nE. Michael Jones correctly notes that the basis of Jewish ideology is the rejection of Jesus. Those among Jesus’s people who accepted Jesus’s message became Christians—and later, in many cases, Muslims, who are still “Christians” in the sense of accepting Jesus’s message and embracing Jesus as the one and only true Messiah; while those who scorned, hated, and rejected Jesus became “Jews.”\nEven today, the main criterion for being accepted as a Jew by the relevant authorities, namely the rabbinical establishment and the laws of Israel, is rejecting Jesus. As long as you reject Jesus (and are therefore neither Christian nor Muslim) you can be pretty much anything: an atheist, a bit of a Buddhist or Taoist, a practitioner of Hare Krishna or whatever form of Eastern meditation you like, or even a Satanist of the Zevi, Crowley, LaVey, or Aquino persuasion, and as long as you either have a “Jewish” mother or intone some conversion mumbo-jumbo while allowing a rabbi to slice off the tip of your penis, you constitute a perfectly acceptable Jew. Jesus is the one and only real anathema.\nSo Judaism is, above all, an anti-Christ religion. Its most profound and definitive roots are in its decisive rejection of Jesus. No wonder the Jews of Israel routinely spit on Christians and desecrate the holy sites of pro-Jesus monotheists, whether Christian or Muslim. And no wonder they love killing the babies, and the mothers—especially the pregnant mothers—of the people of Jesus, the Palestinians. Every time the Jewish snipers put a “one shot two kills” bullet through the swollen belly of a pregnant Palestinian woman or the emaciated belly of a malnourished Gazan child, urged on by Ayelet “kill the little snakes and themothers who bear them” Shaked, they are symbolically murdering the infant Jesus and his mother Mary.\nWhat does it mean for Judaism and Jewish identity to be foundationally anti-Christ? The power establishment of Jesus’s community expected their Messiah to be a brutal military conquerer who would slaughter and subjugate the goyim (non-Jews) and establish Paradise, meaning perpetual Jewish supremacy, on Earth. Every Jew would live a life of luxury, lording it over a hundred goyim slaves who were created to be mere “hewers of wood and drawers of water.”\nJesus, the actual Messiah, turned out to be very different. He advocated pushing pacifism to its limits by “turning the other cheek,” while making an exception for the Jewish bankers operating out of the Temple (today’s Federal Reserve, Wall Street, City of London, BIS, etc.—if Jesus were here today he would presumably lead a military attack on those unholy “temples”). Despite his willingness to use violence against usurious banksters, Jesus’s vision was that Earth was not so far from paradise, if we just let go of ego, surrender to the one true universal God (not some bloodthirsty tribal deity monopolized by Sanhedrin) and love each other.\nJesus’s emphasis on universalism and love was a full frontal assault on those high priests who had distorted their religion to ground it in tribalism and hate. Faced with Jesus’s message, the Palestinians of 2000 years ago faced a sharp choice. Some surrendered to God, let go of their (tribal) egos, and became followers of Jesus. Others, especially rich usurers and their pet high priests, scorned and crucified Jesus—and have been scorning and pillaging and crucifying and ceaselessly scheming to subjugate his followers, whenever and wherever they can get away with it, ever since.\nThe conflict between the Middle Eastern monotheists who followed Jesus and became Christians or Muslims, and those who rejected Jesus and became Jews, has waxed and waned over the centuries. Today it seems to be coming to a head in the Holy Land. The movement to establish and idolatrously worship a “Jewish state,” and that movement’s obscene desecration of Jesus’s homeland and ongoing crucifixion of Jesus’s people the Palestinians, identifies Zionism with the eschatological notion of Antichrist.\nWestern Judeo-Christianity’s Complicity in the Antichrist Project\nI suspect that E. Michael Jones will generally agree with what I’ve said so far, except maybe the part about him being smarter and more Catholic than the Pope (especially when the Pope is speaking ex-cathedra). Where we differ is in our respective evaluations of the role of Western Christianity. Dr. Jones is a faithful Catholic. He views Catholicism as the primary vehicle of Jesus’s message, and therefore as an inveterate opponent, indeed the most inveterate opponent, of Antichrist. If today’s church keeps making concessions to the legions of Antichrist, and often even seems to side with them, that’s because today’s church bureaucrats, not the institution itself, are corrupt.\nI disagree. I think all of Western Christianity, especially Protestantism but including Catholicism, is inherently flawed. What we are seeing in these end times of apocalypse or “unveiling” are not only the full consequences of the horrific flaws in what passes for Judaism and Jewish identity, but also similar if less-extreme flaws in Western Christianity.\nI won’t get into the history of who was right in the Great Schism, the inherent flaws of building a religious bureaucracy full of ambitious and worldly people, and the murderous lunacy of the Church Militant and its Crusades (which slaughtered Jesus’s people, including women and children, just as the Zionist are doing now). I will pass over the almost unimaginable corruption of the Vatican of various eras, most notoriously the Renaissance, which can make today’s P2-infiltrated sexual-freemasonic CIA-drug-money-laundering Vatican look relatively tame. In short, I will skip the historical details and go straight to the theological problem most responsible for them.\nAs I see it, the original sin of Western Christianity is…well, original sin. Paul Kingsnorth just published an essay entitled “Suffer Little Children” mourning the countless Irish babies who were consigned to unmarked mass graves and presumptive hellfire or purgatory because they had not yet been baptized:\nIt’s worth noting here that ‘sin’ is originally an archery term: it literally means ‘to miss the mark.’ Adam and Eve, the original humans, missed the mark by rebelling against God and the laws of creation. This set future humans up, according to the version of the story told by the Eastern Orthodox Church, for an ‘inclination towards sin, a heritage from the sin of our progenitors.’ What this means is that all human beings have an inbuilt tendency to rebel against God, and a tendency instead to follow the path offered by the serpent in Eden – the path that leads us to try and ‘become like gods’ ourselves. The purpose of the Christian Way is to root out this tendency, and thus to help us return to our intended state as ‘God-bearers.’\nThe Roman Catholic church has always seen the matter differently. Beginning with the teachings of St Augustine, Christians in the West taught that what Augustine called ‘Original Sin’ was personally inherited: in other words, that every human born on Earth inherits not simply a tendency to rebel against God, but personal responsibility – and thus personal guilt – for the actions of their ancestors. It is interesting to see that this notion has made a comeback today on the secular left, which likes to talk, for example, of the inherited sin of ‘whiteness,’ and the consequent guilt that all Western people bear for various historical crimes which their ancestors may or may not have committed. Politics is often just sublimated religion.\nThe only way to wash away the guilt of Original Sin, in the Catholic tradition, is through baptism. But a question quickly arises: what happens to people who are unbaptised? This, of course, includes every non-Christian human being, and everyone who existed before Christ, as well as Christians who die young before they can be baptised. What is their fate to be in the next world?\nAccording to St Augustine, the answer was straightforward: they all go straight to hell. This is a useful reminder that even saints can be wrong. Rebelling against the grimness of this teaching, later Catholic thinkers, notably Thomas Aquinas, sought to sweeten the pill. The unbaptised, theorised Aquinas, rather than burning in eternal fire, instead enter an intermediary state between heaven and hell, which, from the Latin limbus, meaning boundary, came to be known as ‘Limbo.’\nThe unbaptised, headed as they were for Limbo, could not be buried in consecrated ground, and so, in Ireland, the cilliníarose.\nWhen I mentioned this to my wife, she said: “No wonder Western Christians are becoming atheists! How could anyone possibly believe that innocent babies who haven’t done anything wrong are sinful?”\nIt occurs to me that the doctrine of Original Sin, which the Catholics radicalized and the Protestants radicalized even further, resonates with the Jewish doctrine of Tikkun Olam: “The world is broken, so humans, led by Jews, must repair it.” Just as Jewish Tikkun Olam privileges the Jews as the fixers (and in traditional versions casts the goyim as broken garbage to be swept away) Western Original Sin divides the world between the repaired or saved, meaning baptized and obedient members of that particular sectarian flock, and the damned/broken/fallen rest of humanity.\nAll of that is insane on so many levels it’s hard to know where to start. But the obvious place, I suppose, is the notion that a perfect God would create a fundamentally broken, screwed up, fallen world, and then populate it with fundamentally screwed-up creatures, the vast majority of whom will never be exposed to whichever sect’s teachings are the One True Way to salvation.\nObviously if there is only one true perfect God, as monotheism teaches, then God’s creation must also be perfect (as a creation). By extension, all creatures, including humans, are born (created) perfect. Neither they nor the universe they inhabit are inherently “sinful” or “broken.” And the last thing they need is one or more armed sects run by wealthy, powerful bureaucrats marching around claiming that they and their world are horribly screwed-up and that they need to submit to the rule and belief system of the Masters of Salvation or the Chosen (World-Repairing) People or whatever the cult leaders are calling themselves.\nThe Western (post)Christian world domination project headquartered in DC and London looks a lot like the Zionist one headquartered in Occupied Jerusalem. Western Christians and post-Christians have treated the rest of the world, and sometimes even each other, pretty much the same way the Jews treat the goyim: as subhuman vermin to be exploited, enslaved, or exterminated. And while Eastern Christians and Muslims aren’t perfect either, I don’t think they are nearly as driven by murderous millenarian mania rooted in the notion that nature—the world as God created it—is radically “fallen” or “broken.”*\nAll of this helps explain why Sheikh Imran Hosein, the leading Islamic eschatologist, sees the End Times battle taking shape around us as a contest between the party of God (led by Jesus and the Mahdi) and the party of Satan and his minions (Gog and Magog, featuring the Zionist Antichrist). According to Sheikh Imran, the real Muslims and the real (mainly Eastern Orthodox) Christians are the party of God, while the Zionist Jews and the Western “Judeo”-Christians are on the side of Satan and the Antichrist/Dajjal.\nAll of this is becoming clear in the blood-drenched rubble of Gaza, where the Zionists try to “repair the world” by exterminating the goyim, aided by the descendants of Western Original Sin extremists who endorse “creative destruction” of God’s world, and His unregenerate creatures, because they hate God and His world and imagine they can make something better. They try to cover the monstrous evil of their murderous deeds with equally monstrous lies, which dominate the “reporting” of every Western news outlet. But the apocalypse/unveiling is proceeding apace.\nJesus’s harsh words to the Jewish leaders also apply to most of today’s Western Christians: “You belong to your father, the devil, and you want to carry out your father’s desires. He was a murderer from the beginning, not holding to the truth, for there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks his native language, for he is a liar and the father of lies.”\n*How do we reconcile the doctrine of a perfect God and hence perfect creation with the manifest unpleasantness, perhaps even the “actual as opposed to apparent evil,” that we see and experience around us? Well, the mystics tell us that if we learn to see Reality, all that apparent evil turns out to be illusory. But setting that aside, since few are vouchsafed the mystical vision, let’s remember that a genuinely omnipotent God has the power to limit His own power by setting creation free. That may sound paradoxical and abstract, but the idea that the powerful have the power to let go of some of their power is clear enough, as in the case of a powerful parent who has the power to control the behavior of his children, but chooses not to use it in order to let them learn from experience. Since God’s creation is more perfect in that it enjoys a degree of freedom, despite the downsides of that freedom, there is no necessary contradiction between a perfect God and a perfect creation whose creatures (perhaps even including inanimate ones, if panpsychism is correct) have the freedom to rebel against God if they so choose, and wind up creating a lot of unpleasantness by doing so.\nMany aspects of Christianity have never made sense to me. An anthropomorphic God, the Trinity, vicarious salvation, original sin, papal infallibility…all of this has always struck me as bizarre, utterly divorced from the real world as I experience and learn about it, and obviously irrational. And yet much of Christianity also seems beautiful and true. Since the whole Catholic package works fine for Dr. E. Michael Jones, who is uncommonly intelligent and rational, I can only shrug my shoulders and say “Allah knows best.”\nBelow is Dr. Jones’ response to my article “Zionism Is Antichrist”, specifically the part about original sin. It seems that the Catholic and Orthodox positions may not be all that different. In any case, they are both different from the Islamic position, which is that we are accountable only for our own sins, not for those of our ancestors.\nMeanwhile, if you get tired of serious theology, check out my new theo-satire “ADL Says ‘God’s Mercy’ Is an Anti-Semitic Trope.”-KB\nOf Camels and Unitarians\nBy E. Michael Jones\nI remember riding through Tehran next to Kevin Barrett listening to him tell me the story of his conversion to Islam. This was probably in 2013 at the first of many conferences I would attend over the next ten years organized by the late Nader Talebzadeh, a man who brought east and west together in a way that has been sorely missed since his untimely demise. The bus was full of Iranians who were evidently listening to our conversation. I know this because when Kevin said that he had been raised as a Unitarian, I replied “All you did was add camels to your Unitarianism,” at which point the Iranians on the bus all burst out laughing.\nI have nothing against camels, but as “America’s leading Catholic intellectual,” as Kevin put it, I have a congenital allergic reaction to Unitarianism and more importantly to the Puritanism which spawned the Unitarian reaction by promulgating the distorted notion of Original Sin that goes by the term innate or total depravity. Ever since Ralph Waldo Emerson gave his Harvard Divinity school address, American culture has been plagued by two equally false understandings of Original Sin. Kevin continues that great American tradition by perpetuating that misunderstanding in one of his recent articles.(1)\nKevin dives into the deep end of the theological pool by citing as his authority on matters Catholic a young man by the name of Paul Kingsnorth. Kingsnorth is an Englishman, who converted from England’s version of Greta Thunbergism to Eastern orthodoxy, without picking up a rudimentary understanding of Christian theology along the way. Kingsnorth’s conversion, however, did allow him to dress up England’s ancestral hatred of Catholicism in theological terminology, and that led him to excoriate the Catholic Church for consigning “countless Irish babies . . . to unmarked graves and presumptive hellfire or purgatory because they were unbaptized.” I’m not sure whether presumptive hellfire is hotter than normal hellfire, but the idea that the Catholic Church sends “countless Irish babies” to hell “or purgatory” is a preposterous claim unknown in Catholic theology. To begin with, only the baptized can go to purgatory, where their souls are purged of the effects of the sins they have committed in this life. The souls in purgatory are known as the church suffering because they have been saved and will eventually enter heaven.\nThe Catholic Church affirms that baptism is necessary for salvation, but it also affirms that those who through no fault of their own could not know of Christ or his gospel or the requirement of baptism will be saved by how they follow the moral law which has been engraved on their conscience. The doctrine is known as invincible ignorance, and, unfortunately, it does not apply to people like Kingsnorth, who is presumably a member in good standing of the Orthodox church even though he does not understand its theology, which is identical to Catholic theology on baptism and Original Sin.\nIn a recent interview with Ben Shapiro, Bishop Robert Barron misused the idea invincible ignorance by applying it to Jews alive today. After Shapiro asked him “Am I going to hell?” Bishop Barron hemmed and then he hawed and then he invoked a misunderstanding of documents of Vatican II, when he should have asked simply, “Ben, are you baptized?” Shapiro presumably would have said “no,” and at that point Bishop Barron should have said, “Ben, if you refuse to be baptized, you cannot be saved.” In doing that Bishop Barron would have established at least one Catholic principle—the necessity of baptism for salvation—in a clear cut case, namely, the fact that the Jewish refusal to accept baptism denies them salvation.\nThe case of unbaptized infants is different even though the same principle applies. Kingsnorth then brings up limbo, another theological concept which he does not understand. Limbo is a theologoumenon, which is to say, a category of the mind which has been deduced according to human reason from theological principles which are certain, like “Baptism is necessary for salvation.” Limbo occupies a middle space between the theological certainty that Baptism is necessary for salvation and the moral certainty that God does not punish the innocent for sins that they did not commit. Original sin is not the same as actual sin. Original sin is a “wound,” the key concept that separates the Catholic understanding from the Calvinist belief in total depravity and the Unitarian Emersonian overly optimistic American version which Kevin seems to have inherited when he claims that nature and man are “perfect.” How anyone can watch the behavior of the unbaptized Israelis and their genocidal attack on innocent women and children in Palestine without feeling the need to appeal to a metaphysical understanding of evil is beyond me, probably because I’m a Catholic who follows the traditional teaching of the Catholic Church, as expounded in the Catechism of the Catholic Church:\nFollowing St. Paul, the Church has always taught that the overwhelming misery which oppresses men and their inclination toward evil and death cannot be understood apart from the connection with Adam’s sin and the fact that he has transmitted to us a sin with which we are all born afflicted, a sin which is the “death of the soul.” Because of this certainty of faith, the Church baptizes for the remission sin even tiny infants who have not committed personal sin.(2)\nSo, to answer the question posed by Kevin’s Muslim wife, who wondered “How could anyone possibly believe that innocent babies who haven’t done anything wrong are sinful?” the Catholic Church responds:\nAlthough it is proper to each individual, original sin does not have the character of personal fault in any of Adam’s descendants. It is a deprivation of original holiness and justice, but human nature has not been totally corrupted. It is wounded in the natural powers proper to it: subject to ignorance, suffering, and the domination of death; and inclined to sin—an inclination to evil that is called “concupiscence.” Baptism, by imparting the life of Christ’s grace, erases original sin and turns a man back toward God, but the consequences for nature, weakened and inclined to evil, persist in man and summon him to spiritual battle.(3)\nKingsnorth to his credit brings up the concept of sin embodied in the Greek term “hamartia,” which he does not name, but which does derive from archery. Virtuous behavior is like the arrow which hits the target. Sin is the arrow which misses the target by going to one side—in this instance the Calvinist exaggeration—or the other—in this instance the Emersonian minimalization of Original Sin which still plagues the mind of Unitarianism insofar as it still has a mind left to plague. The Catholic understanding of Original Sin is related to the Catholic understanding of penance, or the effort required to remove the effect of sin even after the sin has been confessed. According to St. John Chrysostom, sin is like an arrow. Even after the arrow has been removed, the wound remains requiring healing. The same thing is true of Original Sin, which is the “wound” which Adam’s sin bequeathed to the entire human race. No one enters heaven until that wound has been healed by the grace of baptism.\nKevin Barrett, Zionism is Antichrist, December 3, 2023. https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/?tab=rm&ogbl#inbox/FMfcgzGwHxsbrjdzWcfWjLxdxrvKCpsx\nCatechism of the Catholic Church , para 403.\nCatechism of the Catholic Church, para. 404.\nDr. Kevin Barrett, a Ph.D. Arabist-Islamologist is one of America’s best-known critics of the War on Terror.\nHe also has appeared many times on Fox, CNN, PBS, and other broadcast outlets, and has inspired feature stories and op-eds in the New York Times, the Christian Science Monitor, the Chicago Tribune, and other leading publications.\nDr. Barrett has taught at colleges and universities in San Francisco, Paris, and Wisconsin; where he ran for Congress in 2008.

All opinions are our own. Affiliate links may be used.\nAbout The Curse of the Werepenguin\nAll orphan Bolt Wattle has ever wanted was to find his true family. When a mysterious baron in far-off Brugaria sends for Bolt, he wonders if he's getting closer to finding his long-lost parents. But Baron Chordata appears to be a twelve-year-old boy who wears tuxedos all the time, shouts at everyone, and forbids Bolt from asking questions. Things couldn't get any worse . . . until midnight, when the Baron bites Bolt and turns him into a half boy, half penguin.\nThen things really couldn't get worse– nope, wait, they get a lot worse. With the help and hindrance of a plucky girl who just might be the world's greatest bandit, a whale cult led by a man whose weapon is a stale loaf of French bread, and a sinister but friendly fortune-teller who can't stop cackling, Bolt's on a quest to reverse the curse, return to human form, and stop the Baron from taking over the country of Brugaria with his army of mind-controlled penguins in what might be the weirdest–and funniest–middle-grade novel you've ever read.\nFavorite Quotes from The Curse of the Werepenguin\nTo celebrate the release of Curse of the Werepenguin tomorrow, my daughter is sharing her favorite quotes from the book:\n“You don't know who you're dealing with.” – Annika\n“I am Annika, the fiercest bandit of them all.” – Annika\n“No. BFFs care for each other. Respect each other. Just like family does.” – Bolt\n“I've always thought of a zoo as merely a cage for animals, for them to be gaped at for the public's amusement.

It’s also the largest video platform, where people watch over a billion hours of content every day. YouTube is not only a source of entertainment, but also a powerful marketing tool for businesses of all sizes and niches.\nYouTube Ads For SMEs\nSmall and medium-sized enterprises should consider YouTube Ads as a lead acquisition channel, brand awareness amplifier, or mechanism to improve conversion rates and drive more revenue opportunities to sales.\nIf you want to reach and engage your target audience, grow your brand awareness, and increase your sales, you should consider using YouTube ads for your business.\nYouTube ads are video ads that appear before, during, or after other videos on YouTube, or on partner websites and apps. They come in different formats and lengths, depending on your goals and budget.\nIn this article, we’ll show you why YouTube ads are effective, how to create them, and how to optimize them for maximum results. We’ll also share some tips and best practices from Yugo Media, a video marketing agency that specializes in YouTube ads management and video production for small and medium-sized businesses.\nWhy YouTube Ads?\nYouTube Ads have many benefits for businesses that want to leverage the power of video marketing. Here are some of them:\nYouTube ads can help you reach a massive and diverse audience that is interested in your products or services. You can target your ads based on demographics, interests, keywords, topics, placements, and more. You can also use remarketing to show your ads to people who have already interacted with your website or videos.\nYouTube ads can help you capture the attention and interest of your potential customers. Video is a highly engaging medium that can convey your message in a compelling and memorable way. You can use storytelling, humor, emotion, or education to connect with your viewers and inspire them to take action.\nYouTube ads can help you build your brand identity and reputation online. You can showcase your unique value proposition, personality, and values through your videos. You can also use YouTube ads to increase your organic reach and subscribers on your YouTube channel.\nYouTube ads can help you drive more traffic to your website or landing page, generate more leads, and boost your sales. You can use clear and strong calls to action, such as buttons, cards, or end screens, to direct your viewers to the next step in your funnel. You can also track and measure the performance of your YouTube ads using Google Analytics or Google Ads.\nHow to Create YouTube Ads?\nCreating YouTube ads is not as hard as it may seem. You just need to follow these steps:\nSet your goals:\nBefore you start creating your YouTube ads, you need to define what you want to achieve with them. Do you want to increase brand awareness, generate leads, or drive sales? How will you measure your success? What is your budget and timeline?\nChoose your format:\nDepending on your goals and budget, you can choose from different types of YouTube ads. Here are some of the most common ones:\nSkippable in-stream ads:\nThese are video ads that play before, during, or after other videos on YouTube or partner sites. They can be skipped after 5 seconds by the viewer. You pay only when someone watches at least 30 seconds or clicks on your ad.\nNon-skippable in-stream ads:\nThese are video ads that play before, during, or after other videos on YouTube or partner sites. They cannot be skipped by the viewer. They are usually 15 seconds or less. You pay per impression (CPM).\nThese are short video ads that play before, during, or after other videos on YouTube or partner sites. They are 6 seconds or less and cannot be skipped by the viewer. You pay per impression (CPM).\nDiscovery ads: These are video ads that appear on the YouTube search results page, the homepage, or the watch page. They consist of a thumbnail image and some text. You pay only when someone clicks on your ad to watch your video.\nThese are mobile-only video ads that appear on partner websites and apps outside of YouTube. They play automatically with the sound off when they are at least 50% on screen. The viewer can tap to unmute or expand the video. You pay per view (CPV), which is counted when someone watches at least 2 seconds of your ad.\nCreate your video:\nOnce you have chosen your format, you need to create your video ad. You can use your own equipment and software, or hire a professional video production company like Yugo Media. Here are some tips for creating effective YouTube ads:\nHook your viewers\nIn the first few seconds with a catchy headline, a surprising fact, a question, or a problem that your product or service can solve.\nKeep your video short and simple.\nDepending on your format, you may have only 6 to 30 seconds to deliver your message. Focus on one main idea and one clear call to action.\nShowcase your brand identity and value proposition.\nUse your logo, colors, fonts, and tone of voice consistently. Highlight the benefits and features of your product or service that make you stand out from the competition.\nUse high-quality visuals and audio.\nMake sure your video is clear, crisp, and well-lit. Use a tripod, a microphone, and a good camera. Avoid distractions and background noise. Edit your video to remove any errors or unnecessary parts.\nTest different versions of your video.\nYou can create variations of your video by changing the headline, the call to action, the music, the voice-over, or the images. You can then run experiments to see which version performs better and optimize your YouTube ads accordingly.\nUpload your video:\nAfter you have created your video, you need to upload it to your YouTube channel. You can then use Google Ads to create and manage your YouTube ads campaign. You can set your budget, target audience, bidding strategy, and other settings for your YouTube ads.

You can use keyword tools like Google Keyword Planner or YouTube Keyword Tool to find relevant and popular keywords for your YouTube ads. You can then use these keywords in your video title, description, tags, and ad text to improve your ad relevance and quality score.\nAudiences are groups of people who share certain characteristics, behaviors, or interests that are relevant to your product or service. You can use audience tools like Google Ads Audience Network or YouTube Analytics to find and create audiences for your YouTube ads. You can then target these audiences based on their demographics, interests, affinities, in-market segments, life events, or remarketing lists.\nPlacements are specific locations where you want your YouTube ads to appear. You can use placement tools like Google Ads Placement Tool or YouTube Video Targeting Tool to find and select placements for your YouTube ads. You can then target these placements based on their topics, categories, channels, videos, or websites.\nUse ad extensions:\nAd extensions are additional features that enhance your YouTube ads and provide more information or options to your viewers. You can use ad extension tools like Google Ads Extensions or YouTube Cards and End Screens to create and add extensions to your YouTube ads. You can then use these extensions to show more details about your product or service, such as ratings, reviews, prices, offers, or locations.

{"id": "1116", "text": "The road safety NGO community, represented by the Global Alliance of NGOs for Road Safety (the Alliance), is a powerful voice for civil society in 93 countries around the world. Increasingly, NGOs are becoming recognized among serious stakeholders driving the global road safety agenda and as valuable strategic partners to their governments. The Alliance mobilizes and equips these NGOs, giving them tools and opportunities to push for commitment and accountability for safer roads in their countries. These efforts were publicly rewarded in December 2020, when the Alliance and its NGOs received the prestigious Prince Michael International Road Safety Award for the #CommitToAct campaign. Download full report\nThe world observed the 6th UN Global Road Safety Week from 17th to 23rd May 2019 with the slogans “#Streetsforlife” and “#love30” . The main aim was:\nTo garner policy commitments at national and local levels to deliver speed limits of 30km/hr in urban areas;\nTo generate local support for sch low speed measures in order to create safe, healthy, green and livable cities;\nHighlight links between 30km/hr speed limits and attainment of a number of Sustainable Development Goals including those on Health, education, infrastructure, sustainable cities, climate action and partnerships\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) has estimated that 1.35 million are killed in road crashes annually while millions are injured. From the Global Status Report, they published in December 2018 Road crashes were found to be the number one killer of people aged between 5 and 29 years. This is alarming considering that in Kenya 70% of the population is said to be below the age of 24. School children are particularly vulnerable as they walk to and from school and most of them are unsupervised. They are exposed to speeding vehicles and infrastructure that does not encourage walking with no facilities like sidewalks. These and other risk factors lead to hundreds being killed annually and others are injured and acquiring permanent disability annually.\nThe youth are not spared. They are exposed to the risks of road crashes, first because they form a huge proportion of Kenya’s population and also because our roads do not largely support walking, cycling and skating, activities that many youths engage in. Other risk factors include speeding, non-use of helmets, distracted driving, alcohol, not using seat belts and drug use.\nDuring the 6th UN Global Road Safety Week, ASIRT Kenya partnered with SMART drivers Organization and engaged pedestrians, cyclists, children to call for reduction of speed limits on Outering road in Nairobi to 30km/hr in areas where traffic and people met. This followed a survey that showed that the community was concerned with the lack of sufficient walkways and crossing points thus exposing them to the risk of being involved in road crashes as they engage in their daily activities. These included going to school, hospitals, markets, work and other social activities.\nOur efforts were successful as we the Deputy Director of Road Safety at the National Transport and Safety Authority attended and made a commitment through signing of a pledge to support the reduction of speed limits to 30km/hr in areas where traffic and people meet as they walk, play and work.\nBeyond the UN Global Road Safety Week, we must all continue to call for action with the recognition that road crashes are a threat to the achieving of SDGs. This is due to the fact that transport and safety are enablers to most of the other goals. Without sustainable transport therefore, it will be difficult to achieve the other goals. ASIRT-Kenya will continue to engage our policy makers to ensure that the pledges made are actualized.\nThe First International Road Victims' Partnership (IRVP) Conference was held in Mullingar, Ireland from the 16th to 18th March 2018. This a movement with over 96 NGOs who deal with road crash victims and have come together to advance this agenda in this Partnership.The first conference was hosted by the Irish Road Victims' Association. ASIRT Kenya’s Executive Director, Bright Oywaya has been honored to serve on the inaugural board of the partnership.\nIRVP has had success in the short time of its existence. ASIRT Kenya as a member of the International Road Victims Partnership (IRVP) participated in putting together a Road death investigation report that will work as a tool to identify gaps and to provide best practices for investigation thus ensuring justice is meted for road crash victims and working towards prevention of road crashes.

{"id": "1124", "text": "Being a business owner is a dream for many people. The idea of running a business the way you want and making all the decisions can be freeing. But what happens to your business when you have personal financial troubles? People sometimes worry they will lose their business if they file bankruptcy as an individual or couple. Being self-employed can make bankruptcy a bit more complicated, but I’m here to help you through the process.\nFor someone who gets a regular paycheck with deductions and taxes already subtracted, showing proof of income is as simple as keeping copies of pay stubs. But when you’re self-employed, this is a little more challenging. Courts pay close attention to the information you provide to ensure that it is accurate. Everyone who files bankruptcy is required to show proof of income for the six months leading to bankruptcy. For a self-employed person, this could mean copies of invoices that you’ve billed to clients or signed statements from clients stating how much they paid you. You could also provide check stubs for money that you’ve received from clients or copies of bank statements showing deposits of checks or cash. A tax return may be acceptable, but only if the last six months are included.\nIn most cases, your business will not be affected by your personal bankruptcy, but basic information about the value of the business must be included in your paperwork. The court needs to see all this information in order to complete the Means Test and determine if you’re eligible for a Chapter 7. If you’re filing for a Chapter 13, the court will use your income to set up your repayment plan, so it’s especially important that they have an accurate idea of your complete financial situation.\nDealing with Creditors\nWhether you’re self-employed or an hourly employee, filing bankruptcy starts your “automatic stay” protection, which means creditors must stop their debt collection efforts. Whereas an hourly or salaried employee may have their wages garnished prior to bankruptcy, a self-employed person or independent contractor is free from traditional wage garnishment. However, creditors can still collect your debt using “garnishment for property other than personal earnings” or “non-earnings garnishment.” This means creditors can take a one-time payment rather than taking deductions from each paycheck. Traditional wage garnishment allows creditors to subtract 25% of your disposable income from your paycheck, but for self-employed people, creditors can take 100% of your commission directly from your bank account! Obviously, this would put the consumer into a very serious situation, which is why it’s imperative to have an attorney working with you to give advice and provide protection.\nFiling bankruptcy can be overwhelming, and when your business and livelihood are at stake, stress is dramatically increased. Don’t put off asking for help if you’re self-employed and considering bankruptcy. Together we’ll get an accurate picture of your overall situation and will make a plan to get your debt taken care of while preserving as much of your property and income as possible.

Please\ncontact either one if you'd like to get involved.\nby Co-Chair Lorraine Stutzman\nThere have been several moments over the past two months when Marty Price\nI have sat in silence on the telephone as we pondered the tasks involved in\nco-chairing an organization that has gone from a \"gathering of practitioners and\nother interested persons\" to a national association for victim-offender mediation. I\nthink we also feel humbled by the realization of how much out-going Chair, Kate\nHunter, has accomplished this past year (evidenced by the fact that it took two of\nus to fill in the position)!\nI find myself particularly amazed that the victim-offender movement has become\nmuch more than anyone thought possible when the program developed in the\n1970's. I attended several of the first \"gatherings,\" as we called them, when we met\nin Valparaiso, Indiana, in one room (although, as I recall it was a big room!) of a\nchurch across from the PACT (Prisoner and Community Together) offices.\nIn 1989 a significant milestone was passed at the Toronto conference when the\ndecision was made to establish the \"U.S. Association for Victim-Offender\nMediation.\" Mark Umbreit, as chair of the association, wrote in the spring 1989\nnewsletter that the organization is \"designed to strengthen our collective work and\nprovide leadership to our field. We need to draw upon the talent and strength of\neach other and to grow together as we further develop the field.\" I think we\ncontinue to do that, as evidenced by the number of proposals we receive for\nworkshops and trainings at our conferences as well as the wonderful representation\nof persons from across the U.S. and Canada as members of the board. Those\nboard members include Niki Stewart, Victim-Offender Mediation Project in\nAnchorage, Alaska; Dorothy Barg Neufeld, Mediation Services, Winnipeg,\nManitoba; Sandy Snyder, VORP, Oak Ridge, Tennessee; Jerry Williams,\nCumberland County VORP, Crossville, Tennessee; Kate Hunter, Mediation\nServices for Victims and Offenders, Seattle, Washington; Bruce Kittle, Restorative\nJustice Project at the University of Wisconsin Law School, Madison, Wisconsin;\nCarolyn McLeod, Community Justice Project, Stillwater, Minnesota; Charles\nMcCollum, Tarrant County Community Service and Corrections Department, Ft.\nWorth, Texas; Kim Fink-Adams, The Mediation Center, Asheville, North Carolina;\nMarty Price, Portland, Oregon; and Lorraine Stutzman Amstutz, Mennonite Central\nCommittee, Quakertown, Pennsylvania.\nWe heard Kate Hunter report at this year's conference in Ft. Worth that in the past two years many exciting things have happened for VOMA, including:\nbecoming an autonomous organization separate from PACT,\nselecting the Orange County VORP as the VOMA administrator,\nelecting an 11-member board, and\nreceiving our 501c3 status.\nWe have also worked at developing links with other organizations and have begun\nthe process of developing a standardized basic training, which was used this year\nby trainer Eric Gilman. And, last but not least, VOMA has its own web page on\nThe question is \"where to from here?\" In 1994 John Gehm served as a consultant to VOMA and did a \"Membership and Constituent Survey: A Strategic Analysis,\" which we, as a board, have found extremely helpful as we look at goals. John proposed a number of suggestions that I think, as an organization, we need to seriously consider in order to maintain the vision of restorative justice that is becoming so prominent within the criminal justice arena. Those recommendations include:\nby Mark S. Umbreit, Ph.D.\nCenter for Restorative Justice & Mediation\nSchool of Social Work, University of Minnesota\nWith many years' history of being applied in diverse settings, the field of mediation now faces a wonderful opportunity to build upon the numerous anecdotal stories of how mediation periodically has been far more than simply working out a settlement. Mediation can move toward a higher level of practice which can intentionally and more consistently tap into its transformative and healing powers. These healing powers are intrinsic to the process of mediating conflict between individuals but need to be consciously drawn out and utilized. A specific application of transformative mediation practice, which is particularly suited to victim-offender mediation (although it can be applied in other settings as well), is what I describe as a humanistic model of mediation. Instead of the highly directed \"settlement-driven\" model practiced widely in civil court settings, a humanistic mediation model is very non-directive and \"dialogue driven.\" It prepares the parties so that they feel safe enough to have an opportunity to engage in a genuine dialogue about the conflict, experience their own empowerment, and develop what Bush and Folger call \"compassionate strength,\" including empathy for the other party in the conflict.\nA humanistic model of mediation, in some respects, parallels the humanistic style of psychotherapy or teaching, which emphasizes the importance of the relationship between the therapist and client or teacher and student, while embracing a strong belief in each person's capacity for growth, change, and transformation. It is important to note, however, that although parties in conflict may be more likely to experience emotional benefits from a humanistic mediation model, such a process is not psychotherapy, nor does it require a mediator to have training in psychotherapy. Acknowledgment of brokenness or hurt is intrinsic to humanistic mediation. Working on that brokenness and dealing with past emotional issues contributing to these feelings, however, is the domain of therapists, not mediators.\nA humanistic mediation model is grounded in a number of underlying values and beliefs about the nature of human existence, conflict, and the search for healing. These include beliefs in:\nIn order to consistently embrace a more humanistic, nondirective, and \"dialogue-driven\" model of\nmediation requires a number of significant changes in the dominant \"settlement-driven,\" and often highly\ndirective, Western European model of mediation. The following ten implications for humanistic\nmediation practice are offered.\n1. Centering of Mediator\nA humanistic mediation model emphasizes the importance of the mediator's clearing away the\nhis or her own life so that he or she can focus intensely on the needs of the involved parties. Prior to\ninitiating contact between people in conflict, the mediator is encouraged to take a few moments of\nsilence -- through reflection, meditation or prayer -- to reflect on the deeper meaning of his or her\npeacemaking work and the needs of the people in conflict.\n2. Reframing of the Mediator's Role\nTapping into the full power of mediation in resolving important interpersonal conflict reframes the\nmediator's role. Instead of actively and efficiently guiding the parties toward a settlement, the mediator\ninitiates a transformative process in which the parties enter a dialogue with each other, experience each\nother as people (despite their conflict), and seek ways to help each other find peace, which may or may\nnot involve a formal, written settlement agreement. Once the parties are engaged in a face-to-face\nconversation, the mediator intentionally gets out of the way. It should be noted that rarely does the\nmediator totally get out of the way, especially during the later stages of mediation, when the parties in\nconflict may need assistance to construct a formal settlement agreement if one is needed. In all cases, it\nis important for the mediator to provide a brief closing statement which thanks the parties for their work\nand schedules a follow-up meeting if necessary.\n3. Premediation Sessions\nRoutine use of separate premediation sessions with the involved parties would become a standard\npractice. These individual sessions would occur at least a week or more before the mediation session.\nAlthough collection of information, assessment of the conflict, and description of the mediation program\nare important tasks to complete, the first and most important task of such sessions is establishing trust\nand rapport with the involved parties. The development of trust and rapport, along with the mediator's\nclearly explaining how the mediation process works, contributes to the parties' feeling safe and\ncomfortable with the process, making them more likely to engage in a genuine dialogue. For this reason,\nthe mediator needs to get into a listening mode as quickly as possible during the initial meeting by\ninviting the involved parties to tell their stories of the conflict and how it affects them.\n4. Connecting with the Parties\nA far greater emphasis on the mediator's connecting with the parties in the conflict is needed.\nviewing mediators as technicians who are emotionally distant and uninvolved, with no prior contact with\nthe involved parties, emphasis would be placed on the mediator's establishing trust and rapport with the\ninvolved parties before bringing them to a joint session. A mediator does not need to lose his or her\nimpartiality to effectively connect with the involved parties before bringing them together. The art of\nmediation -- as in teaching, nursing, therapy, and social work -- is found in connecting with people at a\nhuman level through the expression of empathy, warmth, and authenticity. The late Virginia Satir, a\nworld-renown family therapist, mediator, and trainer, recognized the supreme importance of the\n\"presence\" of the therapist. Satir regarded authentic human connection as being fundamental to change\nprocesses. Making contact with people on a basic human level requires \"congruence,\" a condition of\nbeing emotionally honest with yourself in which there is a connectedness of your words, feelings, body,\nfacial expressions, and actions. Humanistic mediators can have a powerful presence with their clients,\nas Virginia Satir did, through a more spiritual understanding of life which embraces the\nconnectedness of all people as well as an integral relationship between the mediator's actions and belief\nsystem and the core of his or her being.\n5. Tapping into Individual Strengths\nWhen people become engaged in conflict, it is common for them to communicate and interact in\ndysfunctional ways. The expression of intense anger and bitterness, along with the inability to listen to\nthe other party or communicate effectively their own needs, can mask many strengths that they may\nhave. It is the mediator's job, during separate premediation sessions, to identify specific strengths in the\nindividual that may directly assist in the mediation process and to encourage the expression of those\nstrengths in mediation. Tapping into the strengths of individuals and coaching them in how to effectively\ncommunicate their feelings can contribute greatly to the mediator's ability to use a nondirective style of\nmediation, as noted below.\n6. Coaching on Communication, if Required\nThe open expression of feelings related to the conflict is central to a humanistic mediation model.\nBecause of the extreme intensity of those feelings, it may become necessary during the separate\npremediation sessions for the mediator to coach the disputants in helpful ways of communicating those\nfeelings so that each can be heard by the other party. This coaching focuses on how to own one's\nfeelings rather than projecting them upon the other party. Projecting intense feelings through aggressive\ncommunications often will trigger defensiveness in one or both parties and shut down honest dialogue.\nTo avoid this requires the speaker owns these feelings and communicates them in \"I\" statements rather\nthan attacks the other party. Furthermore, through coaching, the mediator works to help identify and\ntap into the strengths of each of the parties in conflict, despite any emotional baggage that is present.\nAdvocating the process of coaching is not, however, suggesting what specifically should be said.\n7. Nondirective Style of Mediation\nMoving mediation to a higher plane requires a nondirective style of mediation in which the mediator\nassists the involved parties in a process of dialogue and mutual aid. The mediator opens the session\nand sets the tone that will allow the parties in conflict to feel safe, understand the process, and talk\ndirectly to each other. The mediator's ability to fade into the background is directly related to\nconnecting with the parties before the joint session and securing their trust. Without routine use of one\nor more separate premediation meetings, it is unlikely that a truly nondirective style of mediation will\nwork. The parties' ability to participate in a process of dialogue and mutual aid depends on their having\ntrust for the mediator, clear expectations for the process, and feelings of safety and comfort, as well as\nthe mediator's ability to fade into the background until he or she is needed.\nA nondirective style of mediation is not meant to be confused with a passive style, in which the\nprovides little direction, leadership, or assistance. Instead, the mediator remains in control of the\nprocess and, although saying little, is actively involved nonverbally in the encounter and is able to either\nrespond or intervene at any point required, particularly when people get stuck and indicate a need for\nassistance. When the mediator sets a clear and comfortable tone, it puts the parties at ease so that they\ncan talk directly, and they experience a far more empowering and mutually expressive form of\nmediation. This style of mediation, which can only be used effectively if the mediator conducts separate\npremediation sessions, will frequently result in the mediator's saying very little after the opening\n8. Face-to-Face Seating of Involved Parties\nSeating arrangements during a mediation session are important. Routine use of a seating\nwhich the involved parties sit across from each other with natural eye contact is central to the process\nof direct communication and dialogue. If the mediation requires a table, the mediator would be at the\nend and the parties in conflict would sit across from each other. Having the involved parties sit next to\neach other behind a table, facing the mediator on the other side of the table creates a major blockage to\nmediator-assisted dialogue and mutual aid. This rule, however, may occasionally be inapplicable due to\nthe cultural norms of one or both parties.\n9. Recognition and Use of the Power of Silence\nMoments of silence in the process of dialogue and conflict resolution are inherent to a nondirective\nof mediation. Recognizing, using, and feeling comfortable with the power of silence (abilities that are\nmore commonly found in non-Western cultures) are important to the humanistic mediation process.\nWhen the mediator can resist the urge to interrupt silence with guidance and has the patience to make\nuse of silence, as well as extended conversation, he or she is more consistently able to assist the\ninvolved parties in experiencing mediation as a process of dialogue and mutual aid -- a journey of the\nheart in harmony with the head.\n10. Follow-Up Sessions, if Required\nThe importance of follow-up joint sessions between the parties in conflict is recognized as central\nhumanistic mediation model. The nature of conflict and human behavior is usually far too complex to\nresolve in only one session, particularly when the conflict involves an important relationship. Often, the\nparties cannot address the full range of issues and concerns in only one session. Even in those cases\nwhen the parties are able to largely resolve the conflict in one session, a follow-up session several\nmonths later (to assess how the agreement is holding or to resolve any issues that may have emerged)\ncan be important in the overall process of healing and closure.\nThe dominant model in Western culture of settlement-driven mediation is clearly beneficial to many\npeople in conflict and superior to the adversarial legal process and court system in most cases. Moving\nto a higher plane -- which embraces the importance of spirituality, self-esteem, and our common\nhumanity -- is even better. As an expression of the transformative power of conflict resolution, a\nhumanistic mediation model can lay the foundation for a greater sense of community and social\nharmony. With its focus on the intrinsic healing power of mediation and dialogue, this model can bring a\nmore complete resolution to the conflict. Through a process of dialogue and mutual aid between the\ninvolved parties, the humanistic mediation model not only facilitates the achievement of outer peace\nthrough resolution of the presenting conflict, but it also facilitates a journey of the heart to find inner\npeace. This inner peace -- real peace --is the true goal of humanistic mediation.\nby Kate Hunter\nVOMA Board of Directors\nExecutive Director, Mediation Services for Victims and Offenders\nJoseph Folger, as keynote speaker at the Victim-Offender Mediation Association's annual\nwas challenging and stimulating. He and Robert Baruch Bush have written The Promise of\nResponding to Conflict Through Empowerment and Recognition, which is about the possibility of\nFolger asked us to consider what mental space we as mediators need to occupy if we are committed to a transformative approach to practice. He suggested that we need to believe in people's ability to act from compassionate strength and to believe in the humanity of every human being. In his mind, even the criminal who has committed the most heinous of crimes has the spark of humanity and the ability to act from a place of compassion. He asked us three questions:\n1) What shakes your belief in people's ability to act compassionately and with strength?\n2) How have you lost this belief as a mediator?\n3) When have you acted from this pessimism?\nHas our faith been shaken because of our expectations of the outcomes in a mediation? For example, if we have a series of cases with non-communicative juvenile offenders, does this cause us to become more directive? Folger suggests that we must look for even the small steps that parties take that demonstrate their compassionate strength. For some it might be simply that they have come to the mediation. Or it may be that the changes experienced were internal rather than external, or that the impact of the mediation may hit a person later on. In other words, it is not for us to judge whether the mediation has successful outcomes, because we may not know it. The outcomes are our clients'.\nMediators committed to a transformative practice approach their work in the following ways. They:\n(Taken from A Transformative Approach to Mediation by Bush and Folger.)\nFolger suggests there are three steps we mediators must take to identify transformative\nFirst, we adopt a focus on the here and now of a conflict interaction, carefully listening and responding\nto individual comments and contributions. This means that we are not grasping at comments in a way\nthat meets with our own expectations as to a direction we think the parties should take. We do,\nhowever, focus on any comment parties make which offer an opportunity to work towards\nempowerment or recognition, taking our cues from the parties themselves. We are mindful of common\nsignpost events that often occur at predictable phases of an intervention that may open the way for\nempowerment or recognition.\nIt is important in step two, says Folger, to avoid a problem-focused approach, checking instincts\ncould undermine a transformative response. Specifically, we will avoid the inclination to shape parties'\ncomments and contributions into one solvable problem, to focus exclusively on tangible issues, or on\nsettlement. For many of us, this is an extremely challenging concept, while clearly resonating with us as\nFinally, the mediator who is enacting a transformative response will make comments that encourage\nallow disputants to gain clarity and make self-determined choices as well as to consider, acknowledge\nor respond to the situation of the other party. This will require that the mediator's actions slow the\nprocess down -- not rushing toward solution -- inviting elaboration or clarification, always responding in\nways that encourage recognition or empowerment. Folger likens this to a dance, in which the mediator\nis following the cues of the parties, rather than the other way around.\nBush and Folger use the terms empowerment and recognition in their book, giving names to what\nof us already believe are the twin responsibilities of a mediator. They contend that for us to be truly\nneutral as mediators, we must both strengthen our clients and help them to recognize the humanity in\neach other; one without the other may create an imbalanced mediation. Folger believes that most\nmediation training does not teach skills that assist mediators to promote empowerment and recognition\nbut teach, instead, an orientation toward settlement. Folger urges us to understand that what we believe\nis a successful outcome for our clients may not be what they want, need, or believe is fair or just. What\ndistinguishes our work from that of the courtroom or the arbitration room is that the participants\nthemselves hold the power to create a solution or to agree to disagree. And that distinction is critical.\nby Warren Oster\nVictim Offender Mediation Program\nClackamas County Juvenile Department\nOregon City, Oregon\nMy first three days in Fort Worth were spent attending the VOMA Training Institute that preceded\nconference itself. On Tuesday and Wednesday I attended the advanced training led by Dorothy Barg\nNeufeld and Karen Ridd, two knowledgeable mediators from Winnipeg, Manitoba. The training was\nattended by about 20 people. For me, much of the material was review, but I found myself\nremembering skills that I had learned and forgotten. The role plays we did were challenging. It's not\neasy being observed by peers. Perhaps the most rewarding part of the training was the ability to share\nideas with people from many different places and varying experiences. This is probably not news to\nthose of you who have been to VOMA conferences in the past, but this was my first one, and I loved\nmeeting people who shared my enthusiasm and interest in victim-offender mediation.\nSeveral of us met after conference hours for dinner and conversation. On Tuesday night some of us\nwatched the movie \"Dead Man Walking.\" Afterward, Susan Carey, who works with prisoners on death\nrow, led a worthwhile discussion.\nThe movie was a good preface to my choice of Thursday's training with Mark Umbreit. Mark presented information about victim-offender mediation in crimes of severe violence. Most of my work is property crimes mediation involving juveniles. I first had a taste of Mark's work when I attended a conference in Oregon over a year ago and although I take Mark's advice seriously -- don't try this without a lot more training -- I wanted to know about it. The morning was full of basic information given in Mark's comfortable way. In the afternoon, we watched actual video tapes of the meetings or dialogues with Mark and between victims and offenders. I was truly amazed and impressed. Two questions ran through my mind:\nOn Friday I experienced an even more intense, emotional time: the opening plenary of the\nitself. What we observers experienced was remarkable. The presentation began with comments by\nJanice Lord, National Victim Services Director of Mothers Against Drunk Driving. Then we met the\nactual participants of a mediation that concerned the drunk driving death of Elaine Menkin. These were\nthe driver Suzana Cooper, Elaine's sister Elizabeth Menkin, Elaine's parents the Serrells, and the\nmediator Marty Price. Marty gave a moving description of this journey. He talked about the careful\nprogression that led towards the mediation. Elizabeth explained how she and her family went through\nterrible anguish and pain over Elaine's death. Marty asked Suzana a series of questions to elicit her\nresponses concerning her own realization of what she had done and what led her to the meeting with\nElizabeth and the Serrells. Although Elizabeth emphasized that she and her family members were\nnothing special, I came away with a great appreciation for what each person, including Suzana, had\nexperienced, and the chutzpah it took to do this. There was no doubt that their willingness to meet face\nto face and Marty's skillful facilitation enabled everyone to get on with their lives in a much fuller,\nSaturday morning's session was led by Joseph Folger, co-author of the book, The Promise of Mediation. I had read the book recently and liked what it had to say. The authors struck a familiar chord when they talked about how many mediators experience the excitement of seeing participants discover empowerment and recognition without having a name for what they are experiencing. We were reminded that, in conflict, people begin in states of protectiveness and weakness. As mediators, we help people move to states of openness and strength. As we help people through the process, we should be aware of opportunities for improvement and recognition. We should not be so focused on creating a final agreement. Joseph gave us his great insights and I found myself wanting more -- maybe at the next VOMA conference.\nCarolyn McLeod conducted the closing session of the conference, asking questions of Howard\nWe all appreciated his humor and great warmth. This was a great way to end the conference.\nCongratulations to all who had a hand in putting on this conference. I'm already looking forward to next\nyear's gathering, wherever it may be!\nby Marty Price, J.D.\nCo-Chair, VOMA Board of Directors\nAdapted from a presentation at the 1996 Conference of the Society of Professionals in\nIn the April 1966 Atlantic Monthly \"Word Watch,\" a column about new words and\nnew meanings in\nthe English language, the term restorative justice appeared. I wasn't thrilled with the\ndefinition in the\ncolumn but, for me, the significance was that it appeared there at all. The column\n\"Proponents make up an unlikely alliance, including wardens, academics, prison chaplains, lawmakers,\njudges and even some victims. The emergence of the concept and the term is an anomaly in an era of\nharsher sentencing guidelines and a push toward building more prisons.\"\nIn place of the \"Word Watch\" definition, I offer a definition of restorative justice that I prefer,\npart from the \"bible\" of restorative justice, Howard Zehr's book, Changing Lenses:\nInstead of focusing solely on the offender and defining justice as the placing of blame (guilt) and the\nadministration of pain (punishment), restorative justice recognizes that crime results in hurt to the victim,\nthe community and the offender. Restorative justice seeks to right the wrong through meaningful\naccountability by the offender, restoring the losses, as much as possible, to all who have suffered due to\ncrime. Restorative justice is not a program or set of programs, but a guiding philosophical paradigm.\nThe most common application of the restorative justice concept takes form as the victim-offender\nmediation or reconciliation program (VOMP/VORP) but victim-offender confrontations are not\ninherently restorative. Victim-offender meetings could be set up to be punitive as well.\nFrom humble beginnings....\nModern victim-offender mediation programs sprang from a seed planted in Kitchener, Ontario,\nCanada, over twenty years ago, after two intoxicated boys (aged 18 and 19) went on a rampage,\nwreaking destruction on a total of 22 cars. There were smashed windshields, mirrors, grills and lights,\nand cars disabled with broken radiators and slashed tires. This sort of thing was not an everyday\noccurrence in the small town of Kitchener and people were outraged.\nThe boys had no history of offenses; their probation officer, who had previously been a Mennonite\ncommunity justice volunteer, thought that punishment was not what they needed. He recommended to\nthe judge that \"there could be some therapeutic value in these two young men having to personally face\nup to the victims of their numerous offenses.\" Initially, the judge dismissed the recommendation as\n\"having no basis in law.\" But at the sentencing hearing he ordered that boys to do as the probation\nofficer had recommended.\nWhile the probation officer observed, the boys went to the homes and stores of the 22 crime\nThey admitted their crimes and worked out an agreement for restitution of each of the victims' losses.\nThree months later, the boys had satisfied the agreements, paying back losses of over $2000.\n(Peachey, 14-15) The community experienced a kind of meaningful accountability that punishment\ncould not provide, and the first North American VORP was born. Shortly thereafter, the new\nKitchener program was replicated in Elkhart, Indiana, establishing the first VORP in the United States.\nMost of the early VORPs were community-based non-profits; many were affiliated with churches\noften, Mennonite churches. The Mennonite Central Committee Office on Crime and Justice continues\nto provide information, resources, training and support for victim-offender programs worldwide.\nToward the mainstream of criminal/juvenile justice....\nToday, in addition to the community non-profit and church-based programs, victim-offender mediation programs are commonly found in juvenile courts, probation and corrections departments, law enforcement agencies and victims' assistance programs. In one major city, a victim-offender program is being run by a county legal aid organization. In recent years, community dispute resolution centers all over the U.S. have expanded their neighborhood mediation programs to include victim-offender mediation. The vast majority of these programs work only with juvenile offenders and only with crimes against property; some work with minor assaults.\n|There are now well over 200 victim-offender mediation programs in the U.S., about 20 in Canada, over 500 in Europe and the U.K., and scattered programs in about 20 other countries. In the U.S., several large programs in metropolitan areas mediate over 1000 cases per year and have budgets in six figures. (Umbreit and Niemeyer, 1996)\nThe expansion of victim-offender mediation programs into neighborhood mediation and criminal/juvenile justice system venues has sometimes brought with it a tendency to take familiar models of mediation in civil disputes and apply them to the victim-offender context. The models are only somewhat applicable. The victim-offender context differs in some fundamental ways, requiring some differences in training and mediation procedures:\nComing together for restorative justice....\nPrograms founded on the principles of restorative justice are being organized, sponsored and supported by the U.S. Department of Justice, National Institute of Justice and National Institute of Corrections. In 1994 the American Bar Association published its Endorsement of Victim-Offender Mediation/Dialogue Programs and recommended that such programs be incorporated into federal, state, and local criminal justice systems.\nThere has often been an uneasy relationship between victim-offender mediation programs and victims' advocacy programs. Victims' advocates have sometimes seen mediation as \"soft on crime\" and therefore not in the best interests of the victims. They also have objected loudly when victim-offender programs have been overly persuasive, or even subtly coercive, in their efforts to enlist the participation of victims.\nThe victims' assistance programs are teaching us how to work sensitively and respectfully with victims. At the same time, victims' advocacy organizations have been recognizing that swift and certain punishment, often important to victims' experience of justice, is many times not sufficient to allow victims to heal their wounds, and that confronting their offenders in mediation can help to meet their needs for healing. The recognition of common ground is leading to alliances and partnerships. For example:\nWhat is the state of the art?\nThe trends are toward deepening the process and expanding its scope. Highly structured and mechanistic processes that were developed by the early programs are evolving in the direction of models that increasingly honor the relational, emotional, and\nspiritual dimensions of crime and victimization, seeking dialogue from the heart. The \"victim-\noffender dialogue\" or humanistic mediation model developed by Dr. Mark Umbreit and\nthe\"transformative mediation\" model developed by Robert Baruch Bush and Joseph Folger are\nreceiving widespread attention. (Umbreit, 1994; Bush and Folger)\nWhile the majority of victim-offender mediation programs limit their services to juvenile and\noffenses, a growing number of programs are finding that a face-to-face encounter can be invaluable in\neven the most heinous of crimes. Usually at the request of the victims, a growing number of programs\nhave now mediated rapes and other violent assaults; a number of mediations have taken place between\nmurderers and the families of their victims. Increasingly, mediation is being used to help repair the lives\nof victims and offenders devastated by drunk-driving fatalities.\nIt should be emphasized that, in cases of such serious, violent or catastrophic victimizations, the use\nthe victim-offender mediation process would not be recommended for all, or even for most, victims and\noffenders. Such cases must be carefully assessed and screened for their appropriateness for\nmediation, and participation must be absolutely voluntary for both the victim and the offender.\nFor crimes of this kind, the VORP model of case development through separate, preliminary\nprovides only a starting place. Extensive preparation of the participants is essential, often requiring\nmonths or even years of work with mediators and other helping professionals, before victim and\noffender are ready to come face to face.\nWhat have we learned?\nIn the first two decades of victim-offender mediation, we learned the answers to some basic questions, such as: \"Would victims really want to do this? Will it work? What benefits will it bring?\" Substantial research has indicated:\n(Mark S. Umbreit and Robert B. Coates. \"Cross-Site Analysis of Victim-Offender Mediation in\nStates.\" Crime and Delinquency. 39(4): 565-585. 1993)\nWhere are we going?\nIn the coming years, we will be \"pushing the envelope\" of victim-offender mediation, exploring\nincrease the healing potential of this process, expanding its application to a broader range of offenses\nand offenders and continuing to be \"restorative justice pioneers,\" as this paradigm moves steadily into\nthe mainstream of criminal justice. We will be developing new and creative applications of the\nrestorative justice philosophy. All the while, our society dances a schizophrenic dance between the\nunderstandable fear that fuels the demand for more prisons and a growing recognition that our criminal\njustice system is not working for us and will not be remedied by doing more of the same\nReadings in restorative justice and related topics:\nBush, Robert A Baruch, and Joseph P.

{"id": "1223", "text": "Watch Dogs 2 is a game about hacking, it’s got a really fresh young vibe going on, the game tackles current affairs and it’s overall been a really fun (not so serious, scary, or full of doom and gloom) game to play.\nI’ve watched just about every hacking related movie and doco there is to watch. Ghost in the Shell, The Matrix, The Internet’s Own Boy (Aaron Swartz’s story on Netflix, must watch), so I was instantly curious about Watch Dogs 2; a game about hacking, and just how would the developers make hacking the primary part of the game (and how would they make it fun?).\nUbisoft has done an awesome job of re-creating San Francisco. I hope that one day Sydney will feature in an open world game of this quality.\nOn loading, the game throws you into the deep end right away (Metal Gear Solid’esque action scenario), and the movie intro actually begins a fair bit later. Refreshing change from games which have much slower tutorial style intros. You’re Marcus, a chill dude who ends up hooking up with DedSec, a bunch of hacker mates. The enemy is tech company Blume and their ctOS computer system and the world is set in the Bay Area of California, which is absolutely huge, and looks amazing in game (I crossed the Golden Gate Bridge and was sold).\nTo me, Watch Dogs 2 instantly feels a little bit like The Division; familiar HUD graphics and action mechanisms, but graphics are even better in general, especially in regards to the main character’s detail and movement. The characters you meet are quite developed (more like characters in Fallout 4) and stealing cars, bikes and exploring the streets feels a lot like playing Grand Theft Auto V, which isn’t a bad thing, right?!\nMarcus’ phone is his primary weapon and tool to launch apps which control all sorts of stuff like starting new missions, taking selfies and playing tunes (as you’d imagine). He’s also got an RC car and Quadcopter to play with (which is essential and super fun but also crazy expensive so you’ll have to do some driving side missions and hack people’s accounts in order to cash up to buy it). Marcus can also hack terminals, cameras, cars and more. Failing a mission a few times helps a lot in getting familiar with the hacking tools, which are an essential part of the game, but then there’s shooting too.\nWatch Dogs 2 primarily focuses on moving stealthily and hacking, but Marcus can use a 3D printer to create various guns. I’m not sure the game becomes more convincing when a hacker starts shooting his way through missions, but hey the option is there to play the game how you like, and that’s a good thing I think (as I really enjoy shooting games and running in guns blazing is always more my style).\nPS: I got a pre-release retail PlayStation 4 copy of the game provided by Ubisoft. At the time of review the PlayStation 4 version of the game has a major multiplayer bug. Ubisoft are well aware of this bug and expects to have it fixed by the time the game launches for the public (it’s now available!). I’ll be buying the PC version of the game when it launches at the end of this month so I can test out the multuplayer with Ved!\nFor more info, visit: http://watchdogs.ubisoft.com", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

{"id": "1248", "text": "As many of you know I am doing a series at my blog titled, â€œCareless with the Truthâ€ and the title comes from an Albert Einstein quote:\nâ€œWhoever is careless with the truth in small matters cannot be trusted with important matters.â€\nThis all began because a truthful blog commentary I tried to get published by a prominent internet publication was rejected because â€œyours is a point of view that would make most of our readers uncomfortable.â€ Now mind you nowhere are my facts disputed; the editor merely handed me the status quo of societyâ€™s â€œaccepted truthâ€ as evidence to why it was okay to perpetrate a lie.\nSo is it okay for us to ignore the truth or massage it just because it might make someone uncomfortable? Not according to Winston Churchill:\nâ€œThe truth is incontrovertible, malice may attack it, ignorance may deride it, but in the end; there it is.â€\nThere it is.\nWhat is the Body of Christ expected to do with the truth; do we have the luxury of attacking, deriding, ignoring, or massaging it? Let me ask you another question; are we lying if we donâ€™t tell the truth? Is it okay with Jesus to tell a â€œwhite lieâ€, to withhold information, to deceive?\nYeah, I didn’t think so. The Apostle Paul makes it abundantly clear that as Christians we are not to lie to one another:\nâ€œTherefore, putting away lying, â€˜Let each one of you speak truth with his neighbor,â€™ for we are members of one another.â€ (Ephesians 4:25)\nWe donâ€™t even use the word â€œlieâ€ anymore; we use â€œuntruthâ€. Let me ask you something, something that will clear up all this politically correct nonsense. When you were growing up, were you taught to â€œnever tell an untruthâ€?\nWhen you learned the pleasant little legend of George Washington as a six year old boy cutting down the cherry tree, do you remember what he told his father when confronted? See if this jogs your memory:\nâ€œI cannot tell an untruth, father, you know I cannot tell an untruth! I did cut it with my little hatchet.â€\nI believe the legend tells us little George could not tell a lie.\nHow have we come to this point if someone is lying or not telling the whole truth we are no longer allowed to call someone a liar? Stinking thinking, thatâ€™s how? I never wanted to nor do I today want to be considered a liar because I donâ€™t want to be a liar, not because it might offend me. Somedays my integrity is all I have and doing the right thing and telling the truth is what gets you through the hard times when you are persecuted or ridiculed because of your faith.\nTelling the truth is an important aspect of being a Christian. The Bible is filled with verses on telling the truth:\nâ€œRemove from me the way of lying, and grant me Your law graciously.â€ (Psalm 119:29)\nâ€œLet not mercy and truth forsake you; bind them around your neck, write them on the tablet of your heart.â€ (Proverbs 3:3)\nâ€œThe truthful lip shall be established forever, but a lying tongue is but for a moment.â€ (Proverbs 12:19)\nIn Ephesians 4:25 Paul was quoting the Prophet Zechariah:\nâ€œThese are the things you shall do: speak each man the truth to his neighbor; give judgment in your gates for truth, justice, and peace.â€ (Zechariah 8:16)\nSometimes the truth is offensive; the gospel is offensive. To be told that â€œyou ainâ€™t all that!â€ and that your sin is so despicable that Jesus had to die for your sins, thatâ€™s a tough pill to swallow. But when you do accept the truth about your sin and accept Jesusâ€™ gift of grace in salvation, then you see that humility and a willingness to admit your sins brings true liberty.\nThe truth is incontrovertible; that means it is â€œnot open to question or dispute; indisputable.â€\nPerhaps if in todayâ€™s society people feared being called a liar because they are one; just maybe they would stop lying and embrace the truth.\nI’m just sayinâ€™â€¦\n“If you’re receiving these devotionals for the first time and would like to receive them on a regular basis, please click here and use “Please add to Devotional List” as the subject.”\nCopyright Â© 2010 David Jeffers", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}

Indeed, the episode has been taken up in contemporary culture as a metaphor for people in difficult, even dire, circumstances. Of course the metaphorical nature of this kind of talk (“that meeting was like being in the lions’ den” or “she barely escaped the lions’ den that time”) means that the circumstances aren’t literally as dire as they would be if, like Daniel, the speaker or subject was really facing real lions in a real lions’ den.\nInterestingly enough, the way the lions’ den is described has led some scholars to wonder if even Daniel really faced real lions in a real lions’ den. We could begin with the notion of the lions’ “den.” Zoologically, lions don’t live in dens at all, but live outside, in the open. The only lions that live in “dens” are in zoos, and of course, the lions in Daniel are definitely controlled by the king.

{"id": "1279", "text": "Coming into the season, conventional wisdom said the Hamilton Tiger-Cats were a championship-calibre team coming off back-to-back Grey Cup appearances.\nA last second loss to the Calgary Stampeders last Friday – a one-point heartbreaker that rubbed salt in a wound opened last November – has done little to shake that faith.\n“If we compare to last year, we are strides ahead of where we were in the second week, ” said safety Craig Butler.\n“That has to do with guys trusting each other and having the same guys around, same voices, same message.”\nThe team heads to Winnipeg for Thursday’s match up against the Blue Bombers looking to avoid a third straight 0-2 start under head Kent Austin. The 2014 campaign started with a 31-10 debacle in Saskatchewan and the next week Austin made a slew of roster changes, tearing apart the offensive line that gave up 10 sacks and shuffling the secondary.\nThis time around, the tweaks are more subtle: Jeremy Lewis takes over for Brian Simmons at right tackle, Adrian Tracy is in for Sam Scott at defensive end, and there’s the addition of Hugh O’Neil to handle the punting duties.\n“There’s more familiarity and the familiarity equals an earlier identity, things the team embodies because of the consistency of the players, ” Austin said.\n“We’re much further along in the continuity of our roster.”\nUnlike past seasons under Austin and defensive co-ordinator Orlondo Steinauer, the coaching staff seems willing to allow the lineup time to find its feet.\nSo, for example, the defensive secondary is expected to remain intact, despite surrendering a late, game-winning drive.\n“We’re still growing and as a coach you’re never satisfied, but I’m happy with their growth, ” Steinauer said. “Each year brings on it’s own set of challenges and you have to go at the pace that the players can understand and still play at a high level.”\nIf the Ticats already have a sense of who they are, Winnipeg is trying to develop a winning culture of their own. Now in their second season under general manager Kyle Walters and coach Mike O’Shea, the Bombers have the air of a franchise that’s finally emerging from the wilderness of several successive lost seasons. Steinauer both played and coached with O’Shea.\n“It’s a new year, the Grey Cup (game) is there and I know their head coach – I know him like the back of my hand. He’s a winner and he’ll do anything to get his team prepared, ” Steinauer said. “They’ve got some stability there with their quarterback and their offensive co-ordinator and they’ve got some better talent.”\nA week one win in Regina – a place the Bombers hadn’t won in since 2004 – did wonders for their confidence says Bomber defensive back and former Ticat Matt Bucknor. It was a practical manifestation of what they’d already come to believe: that they were better than most people gave them credit for. “It was huge, big for the morale. We have a confident group and we took care of business, ” Bucknor said. “We’re just as confident this week and we know we can get the job done.”\nBefore the season begins, assessments are made as to where clubs across the league will finish: this team will be good, this one will be bad, this one will contend for the Grey Cup. Then the games start and the truth begins to to emerge.\nOne game isn’t enough to be definitive about anything, says Butler.\n“Last year, we were searching for an identity until Labour Day, then we established it. That’s carried over to this year, ” he said. “Now it’s a matter of sharpening the blade and perfecting everything we do.”\nHamilton Tiger-Cats at Winnipeg Blue Bombers\nInvestors Group Field, Winnipeg\nGame time: 8:30 p.m. EST\nTV: TSN Radio: TSN 1150\nThe storyline for Winnipeg: The Bombers are coming off a confidence-boosting 30-26 road victory over the Roughriders, winning in Saskatchewan for the first time in over a decade. Now in the second year under head coach Mike O’Shea, the Bombers are trying to establish a winning culture after missing the playoffs for the fifth time in six seasons in 2014.\nKey injuries: Canadian receiver Rory Kohlert (lower body) is off the roster, so sophomore Kris Bastien gets his second straight start, while Addison Richards will play his first career game. Safety Moe Leggett returns after missing one game with an undisclosed injury.\nFive funky Winnipeg stats:\n1. The Bombers won last week in Saskatchewan despite not recording a single quarterback sack. Only two teams were able to win without registering a sack last season.\n2. Quarterback Drew Willy and the Winnipeg offence had zero two-and-outs in 10 drives versus the Riders, becoming only the fifth CFL team since 2009 to do so.\n3. Winnipeg was tremendously effective on first down in Saskatchewan, gaining 343 yards on 34 plays for a stellar 10.1-yard average. That compares to just 5.7 yards in 2014, which was eighth in the CFL.\n4. The rebuilt Bombers offensive line allowed only a single sack in their first game after surrendering a league-high and franchise record 71 last season.\n5. All three of the teams who failed to make the playoffs last season – including the Bombers – posted a victory in the first week of the 2015 CFL campaign.\nThe storyline for Hamilton: The Ticats lost 24-23 to Calgary in their season-opener Friday, falling on a 50-yard field goal as time expired. The team has spent the week practising in Calgary and will look to avoid their third straight 0-2 start under head coach Kent Austin.\nKey injuries: The Ticats got through the Calgary game without suffering a major injury, but are still missing running back C.J. Gable, receiver Luke Tasker, defensive end Eric Norwood and halfback Rico Murray.\nTicat roster changes (and what they mean): Defensive end Adrian Tracy and Canadian kicker/punter Hugh O’Neill have been added to the roster, while defensive end Sam Scott and defensive tackle Drake Nevis have been added to the one-game injured list. O’Neill may handle the punting duties after Justin Medlock’s spotty performance versus Calgary, while Tracy will be expected to generate some pass-rush after logging four sacks in the pre-season. The team will also make a change at right tackle, where Jeremy Lewis replaces Brian Simmons.\nFive funky Hamilton stats:\n1. The Hamilton offence had only a pair of two-and-outs against Calgary, but posted just 267 yards of net offence and failed to generate an offensive touchdown while making just two trips inside the opposition 20-yard line.\n2. The Ticats won the turnover battle against the Stamps by a 5-to-1 margin. Teams with the edge in that category won 74 per cent of the time last season.\n3. Andy Fantuz was targeted 10 times in the game against Calgary, making nine catches and going seven-of-seven in the second half.\n4. Calgary completed three passes of 25 yards or more, including a pass from Bo Levi Mitchell to Jeff Fuller for 28 yards to convert a third-and-18 with 25 seconds left.\n5. The Ticats were penalized 15 times for 105 yards against Calgary, including once for illegal contact on a receiver. With new rules in place for this season, there were 13 illegal contact calls across the league in the first week, compared to just two in 2014. Overall, there was an average of 30 penalty flags per game (up from an average of 21.6 in last season.)\nLast time these teams met:\nSept. 27, 2014, as Hamilton held on for a 16-11 win when the Bombers couldn’t punch it in from the three-yard line as time expired.\nTSN play-by-play: Gord Miller and Matt Dunigan\nReferee: Al Bradbury\nThe weather forecast: Partly sunny, 26 C with a 30 per cent chance of thundershowers and winds out of the west at 18 km/h.", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}
{"id": "1281", "text": "From His Heart 9 February 2024 Devotional\nRead From His Heart 9 February 2024 Devotional, Friday Message By Pastor Jeff Schreve\nTOPIC: The Divine Counselor\n“I will bless the LORD who has counseled me; indeed, my mind instructs me in the night. I have set the LORD continually before me; because He is at my right hand, I will not be shaken.”\nI remember the first time Debbie and I went to our pastor for counseling. We wanted to get married, but her parents made it clear they were not for it. They wanted us to wait… until we were about forty! To be sure, we didn’t want to move forward without their blessing, but we were concerned their blessing might never come. We didn’t know what to do or how to proceed.\nOur pastor helped us tremendously. He shared wisdom, insight, and perspective that enabled us to successfully and honorably work things out with her mom and dad. I know we would not have handled the situation so well had it not been for the counsel we received.\nTHE BEST COUNSELOR\nWhile a good counselor is a wonderful thing, he or she cannot compare with the Divine Counselor. King David had many human counselors in his life. His chief counselor, however, was the Lord Himself. Although the Lord runs the entire universe, He is always available to counsel us, 24/7.\nAs David spent unhurried time with God—pouring out his heart, his hurts, and his fears—he received needed counsel from the King of kings. The Lord showed him what to do and how to do it, and David responded with obedience. Make no mistake, David wasn’t perfect in his obedience—no one is. But he was genuine, and he was honest. He did not sugarcoat his feelings or tell God what he thought God wanted to hear. He kept it real, and he kept his eyes on the Lord. That was the secret of his success.\nAre you heavy-hearted today? Are you facing some big decisions, and you don’t know what to do? Has life gotten overwhelming and complicated? Have you made a mess of relationships due to your own sin and selfishness? The Divine Counselor is ready, willing, and able to help you. If you will seek His face, marinate in His glorious presence, and set His will before your eyes, you will be amazed at the hope He will infuse in your heart.\nOne last thing to remember: unlike earthly counselors, the Divine Counselor not only guides you, He makes a way for you where there was no way before. He parts the Red Sea before you as you trust Him and obey His Word. So, take time today to talk to the Lord. Share your problems with Him, just as they are. Put His counsel into practice and watch Him work in and through you!\nPastor Jeff Schreve,\nFrom His Heart Ministries\nDr. Jeff Schreve believes that no matter how badly you may have messed up in life, God still loves you and has a wonderful plan just for you. From His Heart provides real truth, love and hope on over 700 radio stations each day, in 182 countries each week on TV, and is always available online.

{"id": "1314", "text": "Teens are increasingly turning to dating applications like Tinder and Bumble to meet potential partners and create a strong first impression. However, security should always come first, and you should exercise caution when online dating due to the possibility of encountering more scammers and identity thieves. Do not send out any personal information to random people, and make sure that you report and block any users who make you feel unsafe. Avoid meeting up with strangers in unfamiliar settings. Find a list of teen-friendly dating apps below and download the one that sounds like the most fun to you!\n10 Best Dating Apps For Teenagers\nIt’s not only a dating app because users can meet new people through the website and the app. Among its many useful features is the option to broadcast live, browse the feeds of nearby users, and watch other people do the same. This is the good stuff: To combat the dangers of child molesters, Project Artemis was launched. An “age recognition engine” and a database of typical language patterns are used to safeguard minors against abuse. Skout also employs a unified group to monitor previously banned users to prevent them from creating new accounts. Contrarily, because both adults and minors can use the app, it’s easy for an adult to create a phoney profile and fool teens.\nThis French social network software combines elements of Tinder and Snapchat in an unusual way. Those with similar hobbies can find others just like them in any part of the world. Signing up, creating a profile, learning about community norms, technological tools, and moderating, as well as reporting and banning, are all parts of the app’s multi-step approach to security. Given that this is primarily designed as a means for kids to meet new people, it’s important to know that they take safety very seriously. Further, they interact with and instruct people on how to improve their own online security. If a member of the community is found to be in violation of the rules, procedures are taken to address the issue. The biggest problem with the app is that it does not verify users’ ages, allowing adults to simply establish phoney profiles, view live feeds, and engage in conversations with minors. Even more so, there is no Android app.\nThis dating app, now known as The Game, facilitates communication with people in close proximity. After signing up for an account and uploading a photo or two, other users will be able to give you a “heart” or “X” rating. Those who are a good fit for you will be able to contact you privately. The good news is that visitors who don’t sign up for a profile can only view public content and can’t add their own. Obscene material is expressly forbidden under their terms of service.\nMeetMe is part of the same company, The Meet Group, as Skout. The software provides a wide variety of options for user interaction. Talk to new people, stream your own content, or tune in to others’ broadcasts all within the same app. Users have the option of purchasing a premium service that allows them to send virtual presents to one another. What’s nice is that they’ve taken precautions to ensure their users’ security by publishing a comprehensive set of content and conduct policies. There is a “Report Abuse” button for users to click if they encounter inappropriate behaviour on the app or website. What’s not: MeetMe was sued in 2014 because its vague privacy standards allowed child predators to prey on users under the age of 18.\nCoffee Meets Bagel\nThis dating app, located in San Francisco, is among the safest options for teenagers. It eliminates the need for monotonous swiping by employing a clever algorithm to find the most compatible partners for you. They also provide “tailored icebreakers” to help you start talks with the person you like when you’re at a loss for words. The good news is that they have been featured on a number of noteworthy media outlets, including Buzzfeed, Glamour, Refinery 29, The New Yorker, and Shark Tank. A feature they offer is called “in-depth profiles,” and it lets you learn more about your potential partner. What’s not: Like other dating apps, this one isn’t completely free of predators. You can easily report an offending user and have their profile removed from the app if necessary.\nWhat if meeting someone in real life and on a dating app were combined? The app Happn is responsible for this. In a very literal sense, your Happn timeline will fill up with profiles of people you’ve met in real life who also have profiles on Happn. Your chance to bond with them is greatly increased by this action. In this way, you can say hi to your crush if you discover they are in the same spot as you via your timeline. What’s great about Happn is that it notifies you whenever you and another user are in the same physical location, making it simple to strike up conversations with new people. What’s not: You might run across some strange users you’ve actually met before; if that’s the case, you can restrict the app’s age range and avoid further contact with them.\nTaffy was designed with the idea that a person’s character is just as essential as their looks, thus their profile photo will be blurred away until you get to know them better. The person’s true nature emerges when you break the ice and start having frequent talks with them. You have probably formed a fairly solid impression of their character by now. What’s excellent about Taffy is that everyone who uses it can see what its users have to say because of the various forums and posts. What’s not: The app hasn’t been out for very long, so you may not have a large pool of potential dates to choose from.\nBumble Date was created to disprove the conventional gender roles by having women make the first move. You’ll have to “swipe right” on the folks who share your interests, of course. The match will expire if neither party contacts the other within 24 hours of the match being made. For a same-sex pairing, the initial move is always up to you.\nUnlike most dating apps, this one helps its users find exciting activities in their immediate area. The app detects your location and sends you a hand-picked schedule of events in the area. You can organise to meet up with friends or a potential date if and when an event you want to attend suddenly arises.\nTinder, the most popular dating app to date, allows users to quickly browse profiles and like or pass on those they aren’t interested in. A match is made when both users confirm their mutual interest by tapping the “right” button on each other’s profiles. When you’ve found a match, you may start chatting with them right in the app.", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}
{"id": "1316", "text": "I like a big story. I like a big idea. And every ounce of my Newfoundlander upbringing likes a big laugh. But apart from being 6’2”, (blue eyes and blonde curly locks-once-apon-a-time), I’m not a big person…and I have no real interest in being someone “big”. It’s not me.\nI was working on a project earlier today for a client. He’s a custom homebuilder with a great reputation, a string of home building awards to his credit, and a waiting list of clients who want him to build their homes. And you’d think in this economy, he’d just hire a bunch of those out of work trades people we keep reading about here in BC and build everyone’s house right away! Get it done before the money and work goes elsewhere.\nHell, I would have thought that, too.\nSo in his email to me regarding his blog update and website changes he said he decided he only wanted to build three to four homes a year. The whole idea of being a “large volume builder” was a loss to him. He couldn’t focus on giving each client personal attention, nor could he be hands-on with each project if he spent all his time managing ten or more home constructions in the one year. Of course when you see the kinds of homes he builds, you come to understand his commitment to quality.\nEssentially, he knows that being big does not mean being better.\nIt didn’t really surprise me, but it made me sit back and think about the ever-growing list of companies who obviously think bigger is better – like Wal-Mart, Canadian Tire, Home Depot, and the American “we’re buying Canada” company Target; who collectively occupy about a half-million square feet in retail space and have at least ten employees between them. (I swear Home Depot’s motto has changed to, “You can’t find it. We won’t help”.)\nIs bigger better? (Texans need not respond). Do we really need one or two mega companies at the cost of many smaller ones who actually treat customers like humans and genuinely appreciate our business? For that matter, is it necessary to have 26 ounce steak on a menu?\nBigger is not only not better, (Jeeze, my high school English teacher, Stump Kelly, is spinning in his grave after that last display of poor sentence structure, double, possibly triple negatives, and the aside into which I just launched) it’s bloody friggin’ annoying. No one can be everything to everyone… not even Stephen Harper – although you can tell him, I’m not risking my position on the voter’s list.\nBig doesn’t mean better service. It doesn’t even guarantee the company will be here next year. You know the saying, “The bigger they are, the harder they fall”. Heck, In Kelowna, BC alone, three big advertising agencies have gone boobies to the sky in the last 2 years. While little guys like me (www.greatcreative.com) are still here, chugging along making a living – and providing exceptional customer service in the process. (a wee moment of shameless self-promotion, if you will)\nAnd, when the feeling is right, and the client is willing, I have a big idea. It just comes from a small company.\nBack a long time ago when I was first dating the girl I would marry, her sister made me a pair of pajamas for Christmas. They were size 46 waist. I’ve never been more than a 36. ..okay, maybe a 38 that first year at St. Francis Xavier University (you know how it is, away from home for the first time, lots of comfort food in the cafeteria) …but never near the PJ size as Bri thought I was.\nThey’re big. And every once in a while they pop up in front of me like a big idea…\n…so I try them on.\nAlbert Berkshire is a writer, producer and voice actor. He lives, writes and plays on Canada’s West Coast, and from time to time, he shares the stories that make his company, GreatCreative.Com successful.

The recent development of blockchains introduces a new type of party to this problem, whose trustworthiness relies on a public ledger and distributed computation. The challenge in this setting is to reconcile the minimalistic and public nature of blockchains with elaborate fair exchange requirements, from functionality to privacy. Zero-knowledge contingent payments (ZKCP) are a class of protocols that are promising in this direction, allowing the fair exchange of data for payment. We propose a new ZKCP protocol that, when compared to others, requires less computation from the blockchain and less interaction between parties. The protocol is based on two-party (weak) adaptor signatures, which we show how to instantiate from state of the art multiparty signing protocols. We improve the symbolic definition of ZKCP security and, for automated verification with Tamarin, we propose a general security reduction from the theory of abelian groups to the theory of exclusive or.\nFeel free to post resources that are related to this paper below.\nExample resources include: implementations, explanation materials, talks, slides, links to previous discussions on other websites.\nFor more information, see the rules for Resource Topics .", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

Each oil was handpicked with purpose for cleansing, purification, beauty, healing, for worshiping, praising, traveling, and praying. Olive Oil in the Bible is mentioned several times as the oil used for lighting lamps (Leviticus 24:2; Exodus 27:20). Olive oil was also used for anointing oil (Exodus 30:23–25) and as part of the grain offerings (Leviticus 2:1–10).\nKings were anointed with olive oil as a sign that they were chosen by God to rule (1 Samuel 16:1). As an important ingredient in the recipe for anointing oil, olive oil was used to sanctify priests (Exodus 29:7), the tabernacle, and all its furnishings (Exodus 40:9). I purposely chose this bottle with a gold top because not only was gold given to Jesus at the time when he was a little child as one of his gifts BUT gold represented Jesus’ kingship! I added Frankincense to symbolize his role as a priest. Frankincense represents Jesus' deity. In the Old Testament, frankincense was traditionally burned in the temple as an offering to God.\nMyrrh dates back to Exodus when the Israelites would use myrrh as a main ingredient in holy anointing oil (Exodus 30:23). It had two main uses, perfume (Esther 2:12) and embalming (John 19:39). I purposely added Myrrh more so for the remembrance of what Jesus Christ came here on earth to do for us! To be the human sacrifice that saved us all! His death gave us life!\nCassia comes from the Hebrew word, “qadad” which means to bow the head, to stoop and to strip off. Like cinnamon the leaves of the cassia shrub are first stripped off and then the bark is ground into a fine powder. This portrays Jesus’s sacrificial laying down of his own life. He was willing to empty Himself out and to be stripped of His deity. He humbled Himself by becoming obedient to the point death (Phil. 2:3-8) and was crushed for us. It reminds us of the sacrifice He made on our behalf and that He became our propitiation and our substitute. (I John 2:2) ”And He [that same Jesus Himself] is the propitiation (the atoning sacrifice) for our sins, and not for ours alone but also for the [sins of] the whole world.” Psalm 51:7 says “Purify me with hyssop, and I will be clean; Wash me, and I will be whiter than snow.” Hyssop was used for cleansing and purification.\nKing Solomon used cedarwood in building God's temple and Jesus was crucified on a cross made of cedarwood or cypress. It was thought to bring wisdom. Cedarwood was used for ritual cleansing and served as medicine in treating skin conditions and leprosy. Aloes was used by the Egyptians for embalming dead bodies. Nicodemus brought it (pounded aloe-wood) to embalm the body of Christ (John 19:39). Jesus was proof that you were worth dying for! His body took every beaten that we deserved.\nThe Myrtle tree is an evergreen shrub that has a very strong root system.

The abortion industry, a compliant and PC media, and activist politicians all deny this of course, and pour out their wrath on anyone who dares to make these claims.\nWe have a perfect illustration of this unfolding as we speak. It seems one brave Australian Senator was willing to tell the truth about this, and for daring to do so, he is facing all sorts of abuse and censure. Consider the headline: “AMA and Greens criticise Senator Eric Abetz for making false link between cancer and abortion”.\n“False link”? Nothing like pro-abortion activists and their media stooges banding together to highjack the truth and mangle the facts. The article begins:\nSenator Eric Abetz’s comments linking abortion with breast cancer are an insult to all women, says acting Greens Leader Adam Bandt. Senator Abetz appeared on Channel 10 program The Project last night and was asked if he believed the “factually incorrect” statement that abortion leads to breast cancer. “I think the studies, and I think they date back from the 1950s, assert that there is a link between abortion and breast cancer,” he said.\nThe senator then said there were organisations, other than the Australian Medical Association (AMA), that had differing opinions. Mr Bandt has demanded Senator Abetz apologise for his comments and not attend the upcoming World Congress of Families conference.\n“Eric Abetz’s comments are an insult, not just to any woman who has suffered breast cancer or who has had an abortion, but to all women,” the MP said. “The minister should not scare young women by peddling his dark, anti-choice ideology on national television. This is a Government of old men who do not share modern Australian values”…\nAMA President Associate Professor Brian Owler appeared to hear things differently. Last night he told media the senator had “cherrypicked” old information skewed toward an anti-abortion ideology.\nAn “insult to women”? “Cherrypicked”? So who is right here? The truth is, there is a growing scientific awareness of the relationship between abortion and breast cancer. One American expert, Dr Joel Brind, an Endocrinology Professor, has said that “the single most avoidable risk factor for breast cancer is induced abortion.”\nAs he states elsewhere: “By way of background, abortion raises a woman’s risk for breast cancer in two ways; the debate is over the second, not the first. Scientists have long understood that the risk of breast cancer is reduced when a woman completes a full-term pregnancy. This ‘protective effect of childbearing’ is lost with an abortion. The second way abortion increases the likelihood of breast cancer is that an abortion leaves a woman with more cancer-vulnerable breast tissue than she had before she became pregnant.”\nMany studies can be mentioned here. A study in Sri Lanka found that abortion triples risk of breast cancer in women, as one discussion notes:\nA new study coming from researchers in Sri Lanka finds women who had abortions more than triple their breast cancer risk compared with women who carry their pregnancy to term. The study was published in the journal Cancer Epidemiology and found a 3.42 odds ratio against women having abortions compared with those who kept their baby.\nAbortion was the most significant factor in the study on breast cancer risk and researchers found a significantly reduced risk associated with prolonged duration of breastfeeding a newborn. Malintha De Silva and colleagues from the University of Colombo led the study.\nThe Sri Lankan study is the fourth epidemiological study in fourteen months to report an abortion-breast cancer link, including studies from the U.S., China and Turkey. Other studies have shown the protective effect a full-term pregnancy has for women.\nA study in India also demonstrates this link, showing that abortion raises the breast cancer risk six-fold. One report says this about the findings:\nA study published in the Indian Journal of Community Medicine (May, 2013) found a 6.38-fold greater risk of breast cancer among women with histories of induced abortion. The study, led by Ramachandra Kamath, MD (Department of Public Health, Manipal University), found induced abortion was the most important risk factor….\nThe authors found a non-statistically significant 1.76-fold risk increase among women with first births after age 30. “Medical texts acknowledge delayed first full term pregnancy is a risk factor for breast cancer. It’s indisputable that abortion contributes to delayed first full term pregnancies; and in some cases, women remain childless forever, which is also an accepted risk factor.” Kamath’s group observed that India has the “largest estimated number of breast cancer deaths worldwide,” and breast cancer rates are on the rise there.\nA more recent examination of the data makes this point even stronger. As Dr Brind writes,\nA new systematic review and meta-analysis of abortion and breast cancer (ABC link) in China was just published four days ago in the prestigious, peer-reviewed international cancer journal, Cancer Causes and Control. In this meta-analysis (a study of studies, in which results from many studies are pooled), Dr. Yubei Huang et al. reported that, combining all 36 studies on the ABC link in China that have been published through 2012, the overall risk of developing breast cancer among women who had at least one induced abortion was significantly increased by 44%.\nThese results, said the authors, “were consistent with a previously published systematic review”. That review was the one I published in the British Medical Association’s epidemiology journal with colleagues from Penn State Medical Center in 1996, which study reported an overall significant 30% increased risk of breast cancer in worldwide studies.\nThis is just a small sampling of the evidence. But pro-deathers and secular left activists hate to let the truth and evidence get out in this debate. They prefer to cover it up and demonise those who share it. Well done to Eric Abetz for having the guts to stand up and speak truth on this vital issue, even when it is unpopular to do so.\nWomen certainly deserve to hear the truth about this.", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

{"id": "1438", "text": "Financial management is all about organizing, controlling and directing various activities of the organization related to finance. There are three elements of financial management required in an organization: investment decision, financial decision and dividend decision. These elements together ensure proper financial management of organizations.\nObjectives of financial management\nSince finance management covers all the main function of an organization, its objectives relate to an organization’s success:\n- There must be a regular inflow and outflow of funds for the proper functioning of every activity in the organization.\n- In the availability of the funds, the amount must be used in the best possible way with minimum wastage.\n- An organization must ensure safe investment so that a high rate of return can be achieved in the invested amount.\n- The shareholders who have invested in the organization must be given high return which eventually depends upon the share’s market price, their expectations and earning capacity.\n- An organization must ensure that there is an equal balance in the firm’s debt and equity level.\nIt is quite necessary for an organization to achieve such objectives otherwise it is liable to bear heavy losses in no time. Finance is quite important for ensuring the growth and survival of the business in this highly competitive market. A firm with a high availability of funds and more working capital is expected to be a strong competitor to all others.\nFunctions of Financial Management\nIn the spirit of achieving the set objectives, there are a few important functions of financial management. The functions are as follows:\nEstimation of capital\nIn regard to the capital requirements of the company, different estimations are to be made by the company’s financial manager. It entirely depends upon the future costs, programs and the expected profits of the company. Indeed, the estimations are required to be made in such a way that they increase the enterprise’s earning capacity.\nChoice of funds sources\nFunding is quite necessary for an organization’s survival. There are different sources from where a company can procure the funds for its growth. They are:\n- Issuing the shares and debentures.\n- Availability of different banks and financial institutions such as IDBI, SIDBI, etc.\n- A public deposit is the other source of raising loans through the company’s bonds.\nThe company must think wisely while choosing the source of its funds as a wrong decision can make an adverse effect on the company’s working.\nDisposal of Surplus\nDifferent decisions regarding disposal of net profit are handled by a finance manager. He can go for a dividend declaration. In this process, the disposal of profits are done as dividend or bonus to the shareholders of the company and employees while retaining the profits for future use. Clearly, finance management is integral to the success of an organization. That is why all companies hire finance managers and pay them a decent sum. If you are looking to make your career as a finance manager, then you can pursue management courses offered by MIT School of Distance Education (MIT-SDE). The institute offers 18-month PGDM and 24-month PGDBA in Financial Management to train future financial managers. By virtue of being distance educational courses, these facilitate learners to pursue them according to their schedule. So, apply for admissions at MIT-SDE and enhance your skills.", "scores": {"score": 3, "score_transform_1": 5, "score_transform_2": 5, "score_transform_3": 0}}

{"id": "1466", "text": "Last week, the MLA* ranked the top 25 American writers according to the amount of scholarship that has been devoted to those writers and their works in the past 25 years. I looked over the list, and, for the most part I was not all that surprised by the names that I found there. I was pretty proud of myself, actually, because I have read something by each author. There were a few names, however, that made me stop, including the first one on the list – Henry James.\nMy confusion about James’ position on the list stems from the fact that he is called an American author. Let me explain. Henry James was born in the United States. This is true. However, he spent much of his life abroad, traveling extensively throughout Europe and living for extended periods in Paris and London. In 1915, the year before he died, he actually became a British subject. That is the nationality that he chose to identify himself with. As a result of the years that he spent in that country and his choice to become an official citizen, the British claim him, too, as part of their literary cannon – much of the time.\nT.S. Eliot makes an appearance as number 3 on this list of American writers. He left the US at age 25, became a British subject by age 39, and spent the majority of his life across the pond. He is almost universally accepted as a British writer. Why, then, does he qualify to be on the list of top American writers? It would seem, at this point, the main criteria for being considered American is that the author was born in the United States. Then we come to number 5 on the list- Vladimir Nabokov.\nNabokov is widely recognized as a Russian author, having been born there and having written his first several novels in Russian. After fleeing the Bolshevik Revolution, his family moved throughout Europe. When he was in his early forties, he brought his family to the United States, where he worked as a lecturer at several colleges and wrote his most famous work, Lolita. The Nabokov family stayed in the US for just over 20 years, until they could save enough money to return to Europe. He then lived the remainder of his life in Switzerland. A little more than 20 of his 78 years were spent in this country, but because he wrote such a well-known work during his time here, we claim him as one of our own?\nThe methodology used in constructing this list is flawed. There is a glaring inconsistency when it comes to the classification of these authors as American. I also find fault with the assumption that, because a lot of scholars are researching one particular author, said author must be one of the “top” writers in America. I have attended many a conference where these sames scholars wrote about authors that they felt were overrated with the hope that their careful consideration of the works produced by those authors would make people see reason. I have even sat in on a panel or two where Henry James received that treatment, and I heard a very convincing argument for why he is, most certainly, NOT American (the very bare bones of which I took you through earlier).\nOn Monday, Edd asked readers to help him figure out whether or not there is such a thing as an American novel. Today, Riot readers, I am asking for your help in determining what it means to be an American writer. Is it dependent upon where that author was born? Or does it only matter where the author did his or her best work?\n*The list was actually compiled by D.G. Myers at Commentary Magazine. It is merely based on the MLA International Bibliography.", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}

{"id": "1489", "text": "By FYI Staff\nBorn of Mohawk and Cayuga and Jewish descent, Jaime Royal “Robbie” Robertson was born in Toronto on July 5, 1943, and scrapped around Toronto playing guitar in a series of bands before joining Ronnie Hawkins and the Hawks with drummer and future The Band member Levon Helm when he was in his late teens.\nAccording to Wikipedia, the first band Robertson joined was Little Caesar and the Consuls, formed in 1956 by pianist/vocalist Bruce Morshead and guitarist Gene MacLellan. He stayed with the group for almost a year, then in 1957 he formed Robbie and the Rhythm Chords with his friend Pete \"Thumper\" Traynor (who would later found Traynor Amplifiers). They changed the name to Robbie and the Robots after they watched the film Forbidden Planet and took a liking to the film's character Robby the Robot. Traynor customized Robertson's guitar for the Robots, fitting it with antennae and wires to give it a space-age look. Traynor and Robertson joined with pianist Scott Cushnie and became The Suedes. At a Suedes show on October 5, 1959, when they played CHUM Radio's Hi-Fi Club on Toronto's Merton Street, Ronnie Hawkins first became aware of them and was impressed enough to join them for a few numbers.\nHawkins hired him as a bassist in The Hawks, and Robertson switched to lead guitar, becoming strongly influenced by American blues-rock guitarist Roy Buchanan who himself was briefly a Hawk.\nMuch of Robertson’s career was fortuitously guided by happenstance and when Bob Dylan retreated to the bucolic town of Woodstock in northern New York state to recover from a reported motorbike accident and shake the unwanted mantle of spiritual leader for the American acoustic folk movement, he had his manager call Robertson to join him with Helm, and it was there that they recorded the Basement Tapes. It was there too that Music From Big Pink was gestated with Robertson credited for songs on that album that included Chest Fever, The Weight, Caledonia Mission, and To Kingdom Come. The album’s release on Capitol Records hit like a bolt of lighting in 1968, starkly different from any other albums in a year that was bolted down by a mish-mash of artists ranging from The Doors, Cream and Jimi Hendrix to Glen Campbell, Herb Alpert and the Tijuana Brass, and Simon and Garfunkel.\nIn a moment, The Band was launched and the year following the eponymously titled second album, The Band, was released with the evergreen The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down included on it. After making the cover of Time magazine and pretty much conquering the world with their mix of authentic Americana music captured on five subsequent albums, Robertson, Helm, Rick Danko and Richard Manuel were pretty much done as a unit by 1976 when concert promoter Bill Graham booked The Band at the Winterland Ballroom in San Francisco for a grand finale with an A-list of guests that included Hawkins, Muddy Waters, Paul Butterfield, Dr. John, Bob Dylan, Eric Clapton, Van Morrison, Neil Dimond, Joni Mitchell, Neil Young, Emmylou Harris, Paul Butterfield and others. The Winterland concert was called The Last Waltz, and filmmaker Martin Scorsese filmed it. The audio became a benchmark 2-LP live recording, and Scorsese’s film of the concert became a seminal rockumentary.\nRobertson went on to pursue a solo career perhaps notably highlighted by his first release, Robbie Robertson, produced by fellow Canadian Daniel Lanois with a flotilla of A-listers guesting, with Danko and Hudson also making appearances. Its sequel, Storyville also earned distinction and, again, included Danko and Hudson contributing.\nHis last and sixth solo alum was Sinematic, released in 2019 with Van Morrison among guest artists making appearances.\nHe also pursued projects with Scorsese, contributing to movies that included Carny, Raging Bull, The King of Comedy, The Colour of Money, Casino, The Departed, Gangs of New York, and The Irishman.\nIn 2016, Robertson published a well-received memoir, Testimony. A full-length documentary, Once Were Brothers: Robbie Robertson and The Band, opened the Toronto International Film Festival in 2019. It includes interviews with Bruce Springsteen, Eric Clapton, Martin Scorsese and Peter Gabriel and continues to stream on Canadian television.\nHis death was made public via a statement from his family posted on social media: “Robbie was surrounded by his family at the time of his death, including his wife, Janet, his ex-wife, Dominique, her partner Nicholas, and his children Alexandra, Sebastian, Delphine, and Delphine’s partner Kenny. He is also survived by his grandchildren Angelica, Donovan, Dominic, Gabriel, and Seraphina.\"\nRobertson recently completed his fourteenth film music project with frequent collaborator Martin Scorsese, Killers of the Flower Moon. In lieu of flowers, the family has asked that donations be made to the Six Nations of the Grand River to support a new Woodland Cultural Centre.”\nAmong the many statements made on his passing yesterday:\nJustin Trudeau on Twitter: “Guitarist. Songwriter. Storyteller. Robbie Robertson was a big part of Canada’s outsized contributions to the arts. I’m thinking of his family, friends, and fans who are mourning his loss. Thank you for the music and the memories, Robbie.”\nBryan Adams, Twitter: “RIP Robbie Robertson. Thanks for the amazing music and the great hangs, especially photographing you in LA not so long ago. We'll keep Anna Lee company for you...”\nJoni Mitchell, Twitter: “Rest in peace Robbie Robertson, legendary lead guitarist of The Band, fellow Canadian, and cherished collaborator of Joni's. May his legacy and musical harmony resonate for generations to come.”\nLarry LeBlanc, Celebrity Access: “While Neil Young, Joni Mitchell and John Kay were fighting their way through Toronto’s Yorkville Village’s folk clubs in the 1960s, Ronnie Hawkins, backed by Levon and the Hawks– Levon Helm, Robbie Robertson, Garth Hudson, Richard Manuel and Rick Danko–reigned on downtown Yonge Street. The Yonge Street bar strip was then a ‘Life is A Carnival’ maze of flickering neon lights, honking car horns, and fast people. “Local musicians, as well as myself and others, would fight nightly for seats as the Hawks held court in a raucous style Toronto bar crowds expected from young players backing a colourful Fayetteville, Arkansas rock and roller who’d tell us, ‘Live fast, live hard, die young, and leave a be-yu-ti-ful memoree.’\n\"' We were really going strong in those days,’' Hawkins once told me. 'We were just experimenting; how much we could cram in, how much we could learn'.’”\n“In listening to the Band’s debut album, Music From Big Pink and the slim collection of albums that followed, we knew that the years of such ‘woodshedding’ paid off. As well Robbie Robertson’s enduring legacy as a master Strats guitarist lived on with local players including the late Domenic Troiano and Freddie Keeler as well as more recently Colin Linden.\n“And even those who didn’t play guitar growing up in Toronto, like myself, we still wanted to be Robbie Robertson, the coolest of the cool. I got to interview him numerous times over the years, and his music is part of my DNA.”\nKevin Shea, Facebook: “…. I knew Robbie’s resume: Ronnie Hawkins and the Hawks, followed by backing Bob Dylan and then The Band. All are seminal figures in Canada’s musical history.\n“There was something magical about Robbie Robertson, his eponymous album release. Listening to the album felt like I was riding along the blue highways in a classic convertible, Robbie at the wheel, the wind whipping through our hair, both of us smiling like the butcher’s dog as he regaled me with stories about the people he’d met along the way.\n“It didn’t hurt MCA Records Canada that Robbie Robertson was Canadian; a boy born in Toronto who had spent a great deal of time with his mother’s family on the Six Nations Reserve near Brantford, Ontario. Hamilton native Daniel Lanois produced the album and brought along his friends Peter Gabriel and U2 to contribute.\n“Showdown at Big Sky, with the BoDeans backing Robertson, was the first track for rock radio, and we did exceptionally well with it. Broken Arrow, later covered by Rod Stewart, was a fabulous track, as was Hell’s Half Acre. But the track that garnered surprising and significant attention at rock radio, adult contemporary as well as Top 40 was Somewhere Down the Crazy River, with Robbie rhapsodizing about life along the blue highways. “Yeah, I can see it now. The distant red neon shivered in the heat. Take a picture of this. The fields are empty, abandoned ’59 Chevy, laying in the back seat listening to Little Willie John.”\n“I can never hear that song without thinking of our dear friend Nevin Grant. His Top 40 radio station, CKOC Hamilton, added Somewhere Down the Crazy River instantly and took it into the top ten, unusual for a song in which the artist speaks the verses and sings the chorus. By CKOC playing the song, many similar stations followed suit, and we earned an unlikely Top 40 hit.\n“The album left an indelible impression on me. One day soon, I plan to fill the car with gas and drive the blue highways from Toronto to Tobermory, passing through Shelburne, Flesherton, Markdale, Owen Sound and Wiarton on my way to the Bruce Peninsula, exploring my province and my personal roots with Robbie Robertson providing the soundtrack as I go.\n“Thank you for the music and memories, Robbie. God bless you.”\nNicholas Jennings, Facebook: “Stepping off a Greyhound bus from Toronto in 1961, a 17-year-old boy found himself in West Helena, Ark., by the banks of the Mississippi River, unable to believe his senses. “It smelled different and moved different,” Robbie Robertson once told me. “The people talked and dressed different. And the air was filled with thick and funky music.” The experience left an indelible impression on the budding guitarist and songwriter.\n“When he released his post-Band solo debut years later, the album’s most explicitly autobiographical song was Somewhere Down the Crazy River, which related Robertson’s experience in the American South. The inspiration came late one night in the recording studio. Robertson, an engaging storyteller, was recounting his arrival in the Mississippi Delta. His conversation so enthralled producer Daniel Lanois that he started rolling the tape.\n“The result, a richly cinematic narrative, magically takes the listener back to that day in 1961. “A stranger in a strange land,” Robertson growls, “I followed the sound of a jukebox coming from up the levee.” Walking past abandoned Chevys in empty fields, he explored that world—entranced, but with his eyes and ears wide open.

{"id": "1509", "text": "Whether you find yourself driving through rural or urban areas, an SUV can make every ride dynamic and exciting. Adaptability is what these vehicles do best, so modern SUVs are well-suited to many different drivers. Packed with the best specs and technology, these vehicles give families the dependability they need, thrill seekers the adventure they’re looking for, and hard workers the space and capability to get anything done. In today’s day and age, SUVs have become some of the best vehicles for adventuring. With bold powertrains that allow drivers to carve their own path anywhere, off-road capability that can take the thrills to new heights, and safety technology that allows you to explore the unknown with peace of mind, your local used SUV dealer is your next stop for excitement.\nSUVs come in a variety of different shapes and sizes. There are hundreds of different models to choose from across various brands, each bringing unique strengths to the table, and buying used expands these options even further. Whether you’re looking at a Jeep, Ford, or Chevy, one universal thing about SUVs is that they’re built to last. That’s why they’re such great used options. When getting behind the wheel of an SUV, you’re sure to have an adventure companion for many years, whether the model was released in 2022 or 2002. With so many different brands that have released so many excellent SUVs over the years, narrowing down the models that offer the most adventure can be difficult. However, we can think of a few standout examples that will dial up the fun every time you get in the driver’s seat.\n2015 Jeep Wrangler\nNo automotive brand screams adventure quite like Jeep. When you think of cars that can tear through the wilderness and provide adventure in the unknown, a Jeep comes to mind. No model from Jeep provides excellence on and off the road quite like the Jeep Wrangler, and the 2015 model provided some excellent specs for those who want to escape mundane, everyday life. With standard four-wheel drive and suspension tuned to take a beating while keeping everyone inside comfortable, the 2015 Jeep Wrangler is ready to hit the trail from the get-go. With the option of removing the hard top from the vehicle, drivers can enjoy the wind in their hair while exploring the wilderness.\nThe 2015 Wrangler model’s powertrain keeps the adventure going in a big way. With a 3.6-liter V6 engine that produces 285 hp and 260 lb-ft of torque, you can accelerate faster and reach higher top speeds than most vehicles that have come out even in the past year. This torque level also makes the 2015 Wrangler capable of towing up to 3,500 lbs, so you can bring all the adventure equipment you need for the journey. With excitement and adaptability in its DNA, the 2015 Jeep Wrangler is the ultimate SUV for kicking up dust on any terrain.\n2018 Honda CR-V\nHonda is one of the most reliable brands out there, so it’s no surprise that they offer fantastic SUVs. The Honda CR-V is a particularly great option from this brand, offering fantastic features on the fronts of performance and efficiency in particular. The 2018 model showcases how truly dynamic this SUV can be, making it an excellent option for those seeking fun in various environments. One of the primary attributes that make the 2018 CR-V model so fun is dexterity; with its sharp and responsive handling, paired with standard traction and stability control, you’re always in control of this SUV, whether you’re driving through the city or the countryside.\nWhile the CR-V may not be the most incredible option for heavy off-roading, it still offers plenty of great performance specs to keep the fun going, whether hitting the town or heading out for the weekend. A standard 1.5-liter 4-cylinder engine produces 190 hp and 179 lb-ft of torque, offering a balanced performance that can adapt to the pace of any road. This engine is paired with a CVT transmission that heightens fluidity and makes gear shifting seamless and dynamic. Moreover, the 2018 Honda CR-V can keep the adventure going longer than any other SUV, with the ability to get up to 27 MPG in cities and 33 MPG on highways, meaning that the 2018 CR-V gets a combined 29 MPG. This SUV can keep you on the road, seeking excitement longer than the competition.\n2021 Ford Bronco\nIf it’s power you’re looking for, Ford has you covered. No brand encapsulates American automotives quite like Ford does, which is why their adventure vehicles simply can’t be beaten. This goes double for their selection of SUVs, and no model stands out from the crowd quite like the Ford Bronco. Starting in 1966, the Bronco model gave drivers three decades’ worth of power and precision they needed to make the most of any journey up until the model’s retirement in 1996. After another two decades worth of waiting, teasing, and speculation, however, 2021 marked the return of the Ford Bronco as a reborn off-roading beast. This SUV is designed to take a beating wherever it goes; with off-road-tuned suspension, robust skid-plates, and off-road tires for the best possible traction, the Bronco is ready for adventure at a moment’s notice.\nTo help it get there, the 2021 Ford Bronco comes with a standard powertrain designed to kick off the excitement the moment you get behind the wheel. A 275 hp 2.3-liter 3-cylinder engine gives the Bronco the power to conquer hills, rocks, mud, and more. This engine’s power can be delivered in many ways with the G.O.A.T Modes. This terrain management system gives drivers multiple drive modes (depending on trim level) for varying environments. These include Eco for maximum fuel efficiency, Sport for rapid driving environments, Normal for practical use, Sand for smooth, soft sand and deep snow, Mud/Ruts for muddy, uneven terrains, and Slippery for water or ice-covered roads. The 2021 Ford Bronco is a highly adaptable SUV from Ford that can carry drivers to new horizons.\nEndless SUVs to Explore\nWith so many SUV models across so many brands, there’s an extensive world of fun and exciting models just waiting to be discovered out there. Whether you’re looking for the best new models that these brands have to offer or want to hit the road in a used model that won’t break the bank, these vehicles are sure to afford you plenty of adventure. SUVs are highly versatile vehicles. In one moment, they can help you through everyday life; the next, they can tear your way to off-road adventure. Every driver could use that kind of adaptability, which is why SUVs are so well-suited to all sorts of different people.\nThese three SUVs are some of the most fun models we can imagine, but there’s much more to explore. With each passing year, new SUV models hit the market, continuing to reshape and redefine excellence for the automotive industry. When looking back at where we’ve been, there’s some genuinely incredible power on display that can still be useful to modern drivers. If the past is any indication of what the future holds, there are sure to be a lot of fantastic SUVs in the years to come.", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}
{"id": "1519", "text": "Eureka! I had just hit the jackpot!\nAs we made a stop on our family trip to California, I was pacing in front of our van and noticed no small amount of golden rocks. I picked them up quickly, thought back to what I had learned about the gold rush, and brought them to my dad, elated. It’s not every day that a nine-year-old becomes a gazillionaire.\nWhile he was interested in what I had discovered, he gently explained to me that I had discovered fool’s gold. What I thought to be my very early retirement turned out to be an imitation of the real thing. Flaky, ordinary, worthless, deceiving fool’s gold. I initially brought them along in hopes of running across a world-renowned geologist who would tell me that it was real gold, but before the trip ended, I released them into the wild to deceive another poor soul.\nUnfortunately, mistaking the artificial for the authentic isn’t something I’ve outgrown. Every day I find myself substituting the artificial for the authentic. From sweeteners to intelligence at some point, I engage with the imitation over the substantial. (A divisive topic where I have a hard time making the leap to the artificial is mayonnaise vs. miracle whip; mayonnaise is simply superior.)\nOn a more serious note, there have been moments in my life when I’ve valued knowing about God above knowing God, connectivity above community, and feeling loved above being loved. More recently, I have valued vegging out and binge-watching Youtube videos (most of them would be considered beneficial) above sabbath rest. Some of these have been more damaging than others; regardless, they have all had a negative effect.\nNot all of these things are inherently wrong. It is good to know about God, to be connected to family and friends through phone calls and texts, and to feel loved. Even fool’s gold is useful. However, it’s easy to feel that these are enough when they are only a representation of the real gifts we have been given by God. I have found when I mix the byproduct of the thing for the thing itself, my lifestyle isn’t sustainable or fulfilling.\nThe artificial always leaves me anxious, insecure, isolated, and hungry.\nFor the past few months, I have been immersed in Isaiah 55. The text invites the listener to be filled with bread and water that actually satisfies. Not with fillers or MSG but with sustenance that meets our needs. The text goes on to reveal that this bread and water is a restored covenant relationship with God that is given to us when we forsake our ways and thoughts.\nAbandoning fool’s gold isn’t easy. It often takes clarity from God to reveal it for what it is. Nonetheless, when we surrender these things and return to God, we are met with compassion and forgiveness.\nMissionary Jim Elliot once journaled, “He is no fool who gives what he cannot keep to gain that which he cannot lose.”\nThe invitation to a restored covenantal relationship with God provides us with the only thing we need: Himself. We don’t need the repackaged gifts from God that the world gives us. We only need Jesus – the bread of life and living water.\nFrom multiple arenas of life, I have been reminded of the powerful way God works in the lives of those who surrender their inadequate ideologies and practices. I’ve heard how God has changed the hearts of people who surrendered their thoughts. I’ve seen the redemption of a friend who forsook his ways. I’ve experienced the forgiveness and healing that has come from abandoning my pride. Jesus is our only need. Jesus alone is our ultimate provider. When we forsake the fool’s gold we’ve white-knuckled, we are invited to experience a life-giving relationship with our generous God.", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}
{"id": "1527", "text": "My understanding is that electrolytes conduct electricity by:\n1) movement of ions, the negative ions migrate to the positive electrode and vice versa. This is however not enough, if these ions just remain ions, the migration and separation of charges will create a potential difference in the solution counteracting the applied potential and at that moment migration of ions will stop. This means no more current will flow.\n2) For current to keep flowing the ions must undergo electrolysis at the electrodes to form their neutral forms. In this way their is no build-up of counterpotential, ions keep flowing and the electrons exchanged in the electrolysis can flow from one electrode to the other. (This argument is often given as the reason electrolytes are conductive when I was doing an internet search, also on this site)\nNow if we have say a NaCl solution, this would mean that for electrolysis Na+ needs to be converted in to Na, and Cl- into Cl2-gas. The potential needed for the electrolysis of NaCl as calculated from my tables is more than 4V.\nSo does this mean that if the potential difference is less than 4 V a salt solution does not conduct electricity, ie has very low or zero conductance? If not, how exactly is the current created?\nI've read that conductivity is measured in a way that electrolysis is avoided (alternating voltage, wikipedia), so I guess then only the migration of ions is accounted for, but the very definition of conductivity is the ability of a substance to conduct electricity. According to my understanding to maintain a current this requires electrolysis.", "scores": {"score": 3, "score_transform_1": 5, "score_transform_2": 5, "score_transform_3": 0}}
{"id": "1532", "text": "Toby Keef: Honky Tonk Nightmare Fuel\nReview by Alex Q. Huffman\nFor decades now, Toby Keef has remained both an enigma and a straight shooter with more answers than questions. Piggybacking off the success of his Airport Chain Bar “Terminal Fun,” the baritone songster delights us with his latest offering, “Honky Tonk Nightmare Fuel.” Capitalizing on a built-in fan base has been the go-to model for decades- Still, Toby Keef blazed his own path by crowdfunding this new album, in person, by answering Task Rabbit ads and helping average Americans with their chores. And boy, does the production value reflect those efforts. It truly embodies the sound of someone cleaning a stranger’s attic on a Wednesday.\nThe opening track, “I’m Your Woman,” is a bit of an audio time capsule detailing the rocky start of Toby’s life. The track opens with what appears to be a drunken answering machine message from a young Mrs. Keef to a supposedly philandering Poppa Keef. As she begins to accuse him of numerous infidelities, the faint chords of a 12-string guitar appear. The song kicks in as she screams, “I’m YOUR Woman.” Holding down Bass Guitar duties is none other than Admiral “Colonel” Gibbs, Toby’s longtime songwriting partner and touring keyboardist. The washed-out/chorused Bass guitar was an interesting choice for this track, and it really opens up the sonic landscape. On Drums, we have Brice Glick- Another familiar face for Toby. Brice is best known for his off-stage antics that tend to result in rumors of arson, but on this tune, it’s the drums that are smoking. Tasty fills and laid-back beats abound on this track, and the energy of a man accused of international crimes can be felt in every train beat.\nSkipping ahead a few tracks, we arrive upon “If These Balls Could Talk,”- An oddly named tribute to American Sports. The lyrics are a pastiche/homage to particular eras of Music and Sports. Deftly moving from the sounds of 1920s Gene Austin inspired Country Lo-Fi all the way to a blatant ripoff of Old Town Road (the court case is pending as we go to publishing), If These Balls Could Talk an audio adventure! Documenting the good ol’ days of Peach Baskets hung on walls by James Naismith to the present-day concussion scandals of The NFL, every era is covered. Clocking in at a monstrous 14:57, this track makes Opeth look like Agoraphobic Nosebleed. Hats off to Mixing Engineer Hue K. Stoss for having the patience to mix the rumored 198 takes required to bring this concept to life.\nMossy Oak Breakup Text is a real mud stomper! Detailing an alcohol-fueled hunting weekend spurred on by a breakup text, Toby kicks the album into high gear with catchy verses and an instant-classic sing-along hook! You can expect to hear “You made me shoot my cooler, Whitney” at every karaoke bar for decades to come.\nMaking a surprise appearance on Who Shot This Deer (In Particular) is none other than Jeff Foxworthy! I had to check Wikipedia to make sure he was alive and sure enough…Jeff Foxworthy! This Skit is a follow-up to Mossy Oak Breakup featuring a back and forth between Jeff and Toby as Jeff realizes it was actually HIS cooler that got hit with thirty ought six rounds. Toby keeps deflecting by claiming he shot an 11 point buck (in particular) and not the cooler, but Jeff continues to remind him that only Toby went hunting. …it’s the audio equivalent of a “You had to be there” joke.\n57 minutes and 23 seconds into the album, we arrive at the final track, “Callin’ It A Day.” This song is as stripped down as it gets. A mouth harp and a leather boot are the only accompaniment to Toby’s mystifyingly gritty vocals. Summoning the listener to visit one of his 216 Terminal Fun locations in the contiguous United States, Toby Keef makes a heartfelt plea only to use one paper napkin as he educates us on the trivial details of the Airport Chain-Bar industry. (I had no idea that the Airports didn’t provide the plastic forks. This was a real eye-opener for me.) Toby leads us to a standing-ovation worthy dismount as he passionately explains that writing off the expenses of Windex is much trickier than you would think.\nOverall, this album sets a new standard for albums funded via chores. Every bead of sweat, every job-well-done handshake, and every penny of the 15% Task Rabbit fee Toby had to hand over was worth it! Without a doubt, I can say I listened to this album and then reviewed it.\n1: I’m Your Woman\n2: If I Ain’t Then You Cain’t\n3: Muddy Boots And Memories\n4: If These Balls Could Talk\n5: Next To Last Call\n6: Mossy Oak Breakup Text\n7: 3 Chords And A Half-Truth\n8: Sell Me The Sizzle And The Steak\n9: Who Shot This Deer (In Particular) – skit Featuring Jeff Foxworthy\n10: Callin’ It A Day", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

{"id": "1563", "text": "The Rutland Halloween Parade: Where Marvel and DC First Collided\nThis Saturday October 30, Rutland, Vermont will host its 51st Annual Halloween Parade. The attraction is the largest and longest-running Halloween parade in the United States -- and it owes its birth to comic books. The parade got off its feet thanks to Tom Fagan, a local reporter and super-fan of comics. With each year that he ran the parade, more comic creators got involved, creating an ahead-of-its-time cosplay showcase that eventually made its way to the pages of Marvel, DC and beyond. In fact, Rutland holds the distinction for inspiring the first crossover ever between Marvel and DC Comics.\nComicsAlliance spoke with legendary comics scribe Steve Englehart -- one of the architects of that landmark crossover and the man who wrote more Rutland stories than anyone -- as well as with parade organizers to learn about the complete comic book history of Rutland's Halloween Parade.\nFollowing the first Rutland Halloween Parade's lackluster showing in 1959, a motivated Tom Fagan went to Rutland's Recreation Department, where -- as he later remarked to Alter Ego magazine -- communicated, \"We should have a theme for this. Because it's Halloween and these are creatures of the night, you should have Batman as parade marshal to lead off the parade.\"\nFagan was allowed to shape the parade in his vision, starting in 1960 with a Batman float. Soon, as Fagan recalled, \"I wrote letters to Detective Comics saying Batman was now the leader of the Rutland Halloween Parade and we were establishing a tradition.\"\nIt wasn't long before Fagan's correspondence as a fan turned into an even friendlier relationship with the creators of his favorite comics, much to the benefit of the parade. \"As a long-time contributor to comic book fanzines, Fagan began to form relationships with several staff writers at DC Comics in New York City, ultimately inviting them up to Rutland to join in with the festivities,\" said Dom Cioffi, Marketing/Outreach of Rutland's PEGTV.\nAfter visiting the parade, comic book writer Roy Thomas was inspired to set a story there. In Avengers #83, \"Come On In, ...The Revolution's Fine!\" (Dec. 1970), Tom Fagan -- dressed as Nightwing of The Defenders -- invites the Avengers to be his guests of honor at the 11th Annual Parade. The parade is attacked by the Masters of Evil, who hijack Fagan's float. The fight turns into a three-way battle when the Lady Liberators enter the fray. The issue was not only set at the parade, but also featured appearances from Roy Thomas himself, along with wife, Jeannie.\nThe next year in Batman #237, \"Night of the Reaper!\" (Dec. 1971), creators Denny O'Neil and Neal Adams were inspired to craft a story set at Rutland. In the tale, a vendetta between a concentration camp survivor and a fugitive Nazi plays out in the backdrop of the Halloween parade. Batman and Robin try to stop the violent bloodshed that ensues, as innocent revelers dressed up like the Caped Crusader and the Boy Wonder get caught in the middle. Dick Grayson attends the parade with his friends -- comic book creators Alan Weiss, Bernie Wrightson and Gerry Conway. Batman's fight spills into Tom Fagan's mansion, where Denny O'Neil, Len Wein and Mark Hanerfeld are in attendance.\nAs more comic book creators ventured north, their stories about the parade grew grander. Englehart explained: \"[Tom Fagan was] just a real friendly guy... [and] areal friend to everybody. He could get you caught up in his enthusiasms and share yours... Denny and Neal [said] 'this is a cool evening' and they drew that story, wrote that story and made it look like a cool evening. So next year it's like 'let's just go.'\"\nAlong with Len Wein and Gerry Conway, Englehart made comic book history by writing the first Marvel/DC crossover (albeit unofficially) by setting it at the Rutland Halloween Parade.\nIn Englehart's Amazing Adventures #16, \"...And the Juggernaut Will Get You... If You Don't Watch Out!\" (Jan. 1973) Gerry Conway, Steve Englehart and Len & Glynnis Wein come across Hank McCoy a.k.a. the Beast, on their way to the Rutland Parade. The blue-furred mutant finally gets to town, just in time to stop a rampaging Juggernaut, who has lost control of his powers. He attempts to steal Englehart's car but in intercepted by Beast, and disappears into the woods.\nThen in Len Wein's Justice League of America #103, \"A Stranger Walks among Us!\" (Dec. 1972) the four comic creators make their way to the mansion of Tom Fagan, who is sporting his best Batman costume. The Phantom Stranger leads the Justice League to Rutland, on the suspicion that Felix Faust is attempting to take advantage of a weaker dimensional state and summon ghosts to our reality.\nThe JLA meet up with Tom, who asks them to ride in the parade. While waving to the crowd, Faust's plan kicks into effect, and the JLA must contend with a town full of citizens gaining the powers of their costumed characters, including Glynnis Wein, who turns into Supergirl. Len, Steve and Gerry go after Glynnis, while the Phantom Stranger intervenes to save the League. With his plan foiled, Faust escapes town -- by stealing Englehart's car.\nFinally in Gerry Conway's The Mighty Thor #207, \"Firesword!\" (Jan. 1973), Tom Fagan has switched into into an authentic-looking Nighthawk costume, but has fallen under the mind control of Loki, who is summoning Absorbing Man to destroy the town. Thor, Sif and Hildegard intervene to defeat Absorbing Man and Loki, blinding the trickster god in the process. Loki hears the Faust-driven stolen car of Steve Englehart and rushes after it, but his blind state leads him right off a cliff. Len, Steve and Gerry locate the missing (and now human again) Glynnis, who doesn't quite remember what just happened.\nMeanwhile, comic fans had their mind blown after reading the very first DC/Marvel crossover. For Englehart, Wein, and Conway it was the chance to try something new. As Englehart told ComicsAlliance, \"I guess the first year, the comic book guys were just a handful amongst the revelers, but the second year there were a whole bunch of comic book people who thought it would be a good idea to go to Vermont for Halloween. Len Wein, Gerry Conway were up there with me, Glynnis Wein was up there -- Gerry and Len and I got sitting around talking about the whole Rutland thing and we figured Denny had done an interesting story and we wondered could we do something interesting with it, and somehow out of that came the crossover.\"\nMost amazingly to Englehart, the crossover idea had modest, yet imaginative motivations. As he elaborated: \"The idea of doing a crossover between Marvel and DC, I'm not sure anything like that had been done before, but it certainly seemed like a radical concept and we knew that we had to be subtle (laughs) and each story had to stand on its own, but we really worked it out. It's really worthwhile to read those stories back to back to back -- It didn't matter to us that one was at DC and two were at Marvel -- I think it was us being creative, thinking what would be really cool to do and the spark of all that was the Rutland parade which was really cool and it deserved something cool.\"\nTHE LEGENDARY COSTUME PARTIES\nIn addition to the parades, the comic-friendly after-parties were another legendary component of the Rutland Halloween experience. Dom Cioffi from Rutland admitted: \"Ironically, the earliest parades were known more for the late night parties than for the actual downtown processions. Fagan's friends, both local and from out of town, went to great lengths to build interesting floats and highly involved costumes, but the after-hours parties are where most of the 'trickery' occurred.\"\nAs one of the costumed revelers, Englehart has vivid memories of the parties, which took place in an old mansion: \"It's not all that unusual today if you go to a comic book convention today, you're going to see a lot of people in costume. But in the early '70s, that was not a common situation. And even at conventions, [they] were a lot more button-down. So on Halloween night, well after midnight, walking around this mansion in Lovecraftian Vermont and seeing Dracula and the Hulk and Wonder Woman walking around. t was a unique situation and on Fagan's end, handled extremely well.\"\nKEEPING A TRADITION ALIVE\nMEMORIES OF THE PARADE\nEnglehart still reflects fondly on not just the parade and the season, but on the positive effect that came from seeing so many comic book fans out in attendance. As he explained: \"This is Halloween night, so it has its own vibe to it and seeing all these people having a wonderful time, but all in costume, and good costumes. These were pretty much homemade costumes. You weren't just able to drop down and buy yourself a Captain America costume at the store like you could do today. People got into it and as young comic book people we appreciated it and really vibed off of people who got into it. My memories of it are just the panorama of it, being on the main street of Rutland and seeing floats go by and the cars and the costumes and the Halloween vibe and little kids watching and candy to be had. I remember the whole thing, the spectacle of it -- And afterward, we'd get to the mansion and party until dawn and crash (laughs).\"\nWHAT TO EXPECT THIS YEAR\nThe Rutland Halloween Parade begins at 6:30 p.m. on Saturday, October 30, followed by the Center Street block party. Curious fans can tune into PEGTV.com later in the week to watch the full parade online. As for what costumes and attractions to expect this year, according to Cioffi, \"The float creators always try to one-up each other. It drives their creativity and pushes them to produce better material. But each year's floats are kept under cover by the creators who maintain strict codes of silence.

{"id": "1625", "text": "Found Object Puppetry\nPuppetry is one of the world’s oldest performance styles. It is an art that spans millennia, continents, cultures, and mediums. Whether it be banraku puppets from Japan or shadow puppets from China; marionettes from Germany or Jim Henson’s Muppets–all puppets have one thing in common: they are inanimate objects animated or manipulated to represent something as part of an entertainment.\nIn Pointless Theatre’s Canterbury, we have taken the idea of objects as puppets to the extreme. In this adaptation of Chaucer’s Canterbury Tales, seven pilgrims regale each other with their different stories in the hopes of winning a storytelling competition.The only instruction they are given is that each pilgrim must help the others tell their tale by reenacting the story with objects from the tavern.\nThis is where the concept of found object puppetry comes into play. Our characters are in an environment where everything can be a puppet, and yet nothing is a traditionally designed puppet. A stick, a cloak, and a piece of armor combine to create a horse during one tale. In another, three friends come to life as hand puppets created with handkerchiefs and medieval masks. Everything on stage has the potential to become a puppet in one of the tales.\nThe objects on stage have been designed by props and puppet designer Patti Kalil specifically to be manipulated into parts of the puppets.\nThis is the first time that Pointless has experimented with the concept of found object puppetry. And it has definitely posed challenges that other styles of puppetry do not. However, I think that found object puppetry does fit the Pointless performance style. It forces the audience to not just watch the puppet, but also the puppeteer.\nUltimately, this is a show about storytelling. Through puppetry and each performer’s own character identity, the stories of Canterbury can be told compellingly.\nCanterbury plays from February 13 to March 10, 2013 at Pointless Theatre Company at the Mead Theatre Lab at Flashpoint – 916 G Street NW, in Washington, DC.

After 200 books, and despite several threatened retirements, Warren continued writing until his final days. Always a futurist, he moved full-bore into the world of electronic publishing, and, with his sons, formed his own publishing company, Destroyer Books.\nMurphy is probably best known for the Destroyer series, which he created with the late Dick Sapir. With over 150 books and worldwide sales of over 50 million copies, the series is one of the longest-running and bestselling series of all time. The books were made into a movie, \"Remo Williams: The Adventure Begins\" (a second movie is in the works), a TV pilot, as well as more film and TV rip-offs than anyone could ever imagine.\nCalled \"a mentor and teacher to a whole generation of crime and thriller writers\" by Encyclopedia Mysteriosa, Murphy was no one-trick pony. The St. James Guide to Mystery Writers states that \"The breadth of Murphy's talent staggers the imagination. Comic detectives, caper novels, large suspense novels, sword and sorcery spy novels, and locked room mysteries, together with short stories, comic books, movies, and countless collaborations do not even begin to mark the parameters of his creative genius...Murphy is the professional's professional, with work of consistently high quality.\"\nSome of the other work on Murphy's resume includes:\nThe Trace series\nThe Digger series\nThe Razoni and Jackson series\nNot to mention Leonardo's Law, Ceiling of Hell, Grandmaster, The Forever King (those last two written with Molly Cochran), along with dozens of other works.\nHis books won ten national awards, including a pair of Edgars® from the Mystery Writers of America, two Shamus winners from the Private Eye Writers of America, and countless nominations.\nIn Hollywood, he wrote The Eiger Sanction, starring Clint Eastwood, as well as Lethal Weapon II. His Trace books inspired the TV show \"Murphy's Law,” starring George Segal and Maggie Han.\nHe served on the board of the Mystery Writers of America, and was a member of the Private Eye Writers of America, the International Association of Crime Writers, the American Crime Writers League, and the Screenwriters Guild.\nMurphy was also a member of the Adams Roundtable, a New York writers' group, whose members also include Mary Higgins Clark, Susan Isaacs, Lawrence Block, Harlan Coben, Judith Kelman, Mickey Friedman, Justin Scott, Stanley Cohen and Whitley Strieber, and who occasionally produce mystery anthologies.\nMurphy has five children. Most of them, he said, \"wash up pretty well.\"\nHis website is www.warrenmurphy.com, where you can find free lessons on how to write a book.\nRichard Ben Sapir\nRichard was a New York native who worked as an editor and in public relations before creating The Destroyer series with Warren Murphy. Before his untimely death in 1987, Sapir had also penned a number of thriller and historical mainstream novels, best known of which were The Far Arena, Quest and The Body, the last of which was made into a film. The book review section of the New York Times called him \"a brilliant professional.\"\nGerald \"Jerry\" Welch is a double-edged threat, both writer and graphic artist. The self-described literary bastard of Warren Murphy and Richard Sapir, Jerry is best known for the writing and artwork in the \"Legacy\" series and \"The Last Witness\" series.\nJerry prefers to be known as one of only four people on Earth ever to be granted the title \"Honorary Master of Sinanju.\"\nDonna Courtois is an author and editor. Her story, “The Bride of Sinanju,” was published in the anthology New Blood, where it attracted the interest of Warren Murphy. Together, they wrote the novella “Number Two.” Donna’s second novella, “Storm Warning,” has been published in More Blood, the follow-up to New Blood. She lives in Massachusetts.\nMolly Cochran, author of the teen paranormal romances Legacy and Poison, has written 26 published novels and four nonfiction books under her own name and various pseudonyms. Her books include New York Times bestselling novels Grandmaster and The Forever King, coauthored with Warren Murphy, and the nonfiction Dressing Thin, also a NY Times bestseller. She has won awards from the Mystery Writers of America (Best Novel of the Year), the Romance Writers of America (Best Thriller), and the New York Public Library (Outstanding Books for the Teen Age).\nSeduction, the third installment in the Young Adult Legacy series, is scheduled for release later this year through her publisher, Simon & Schuster. Two novellas in the series are also coming in 2014: Wishes, due April 29, and a Halloween novella, Revels, tentatively scheduled for September release.\nThree eBooks, The Temple Dogs, The Forever King, and Grandmaster, are currently available through online retailers.\nMolly has lectured extensively and has taught writing at the college level as well as at a women's prison (where she was NOT an inmate). She also writes a blog on writing technique which appears on her website, MollyCochran.com. She is also on Facebook at facebook.com/MollyCochranBooks.\nShe lives in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania.\nLen Levinson is the author of 83 novels written under 22 pseudonyms, published originally by Bantam, Dell, Fawcett, Harper, Jove, Charter Diamond, Zebra, Belmont-Tower, and Signet, among others.

{"id": "1671", "text": "The housing shortage should be a major issue at the General Election rather than the Prime Minister’s priorities of smoking and A level reform.\nIn fact, the lack of affordable homes could be a polling issue next week as voters in Tamworth and Mid Bedfordshire give their verdict on the party conference season.\nBoth main parties pledged to speed up the planning process, but Sir Keir Starmer’s promise to “bulldoze through the planning laws” to build 1.5m homes in new towns and “the grey belt” in five years, will have NIMBYs rushing out to their back yards.\nWill the young people in the two seats up for grabs, desperate to get on the housing ladder, outnumber residents wanting to protect these sections of leafy middle England?\nOf course, the election will be about much else, but there is some evidence that voters want action not slogans at the next election. I was at a fringe meeting in Liverpool hosted by opinion researchers More in Common. They have found that people are so disillusioned with politics that they don’t want slogans and visions, but just want politicians to achieve something practical. So, if Starmer’s bulldozer solves the chronic housing crisis, he might gain some credibility with voters.\nIt certainly seems this was the Labour strategy emerging from Liverpool. Shake up planning and the NHS, whilst the Shadow Chancellor maintains her iron grip on the economy. Rachel Reeves caution on spending may be the explanation for the failure of Shadow Health Secretary Wes Streeting to mention social care reform. Millions of people are affected by issues arising from the ageing population but neither party wants to come to grips with it.\nSo back to next Thursday’s by elections which are being held in seats with comfortable Tory majorities. 24,000 in the case of Mid Bedfordshire and over 19,000 in Tamworth. Incidentally, the Staffordshire town is where Sir Robert Peel published a manifesto, widely credited as spelling out the values of the modern Conservative Party in 1834.\nWe have learnt to be wary of the description “comfortable” in relation to Tory majorities. Margins of up to 24,000 have not saved them from the Lib Dems in Chesham, North Shropshire, Tiverton, and Somerton or from Labour in Selby. The causes of the by elections (which are not cheap on the taxpayer) couldn’t be worse for the Tories. The outgoing MPs, Nadine Dorries (Mid Beds) had a strop at not getting a peerage and Chris Pincher (Tamworth) was censured by a Commons committee after drunken sexual assault.\nIf Labour win both, following their spectacular success in Rutherglen last week, it may indicate the party is capable of overcoming the formidable hurdles that remain in their path to power. Last week in Liverpool one had a sense that the comrades remain aware of successive election disappointments since the party was founded over a hundred years ago.\nAt a fringe meeting I attended, pollster Sir John Curtis spelt out the maths. A 12% poll lead would only translate into a Labour majority of 2. It is currently around 20% but with an improving economy, a possible tax cut and a potential election campaign where AI will be added to the existing capacity of social media to distort the truth, who can predict that Labour’s lead will remain as clear.", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

While the smart feature is what draws a lot of people to buying the appliance, once they get it installed, would it surprise you to find out that about half or more of consumers never bother to set up the “smart” features on the appliance?\nHenry Kim, US director of LG’s smart device division ThinQ, stated, “The challenge is that a consumer doesn’t see the true value that manufacturers see in terms of how that data can help them in the long run. So they don’t really care for spending time to just connect it.”\nLG, with almost 90 percent of its overall sold appliances being smart appliances, sees lees than 50 percent of them stay connected. Whirlpool reported that more than half are disconnected. The reasons for this are numerous, as they often find people do set them up, but after they become disconnected, they just do not bother to reconnect the device.\nIn today’s day and age, everyone is worried about their data being stolen, which Kim says is not an issue here. For instance, Whirlpool offers the user the option to opt out of data share. LG does not offer that option, but “all data is anonymized,” so you should not have to worry about any data breaches.\nThe issue here really is the benefit. For the company, the benefits are immeasurable, as they are able to gather operational data in real time. They are also able to monitor your particular appliance and recommend service calls at the appropriate time. That also happens to be an income driver for the company, which is a big reason they want their smart appliances connected when they are in homes.\nThis is all going to be a matter of preference for the user. Yes, there are significant benefits on both sides if the device is connected and if you are a gadget enthusiast like myself, you want to take advantage of that. However, the appliance still works if it is not connected, but I would have to wonder why pay the extra money for the smart appliance if you are going to use all the features if offers.", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}

Manifestation might appear to be bogus for some people, but in reality it is an effective device for achieving your desires.\nMaster the Art of Manifestation: Your Guide to Achieving Your Desires\nThe primary task is to believe that you can make your dreams reality by aligning your beliefs to the preferred outcomes. While trust is the central element in manifestation, there is a bit extra to it than that.\nCheck out the ways in which you can manifest anything that seems unachievable:\nGet a clear picture:\nYou might have a whole lot of aspirations in your life but when it’s about manifesting, always be clear about the particular desire. You need to have a clear understanding of what you truly need.\nBe as particular as feasible, when it comes to articulating a wish, be precise and to the point. Don’t confuse the wish or change it frequently. If you wish to make your career fruitful, instead of writing “ I need to have a profitable business”, you can write “I choose to earn five-figures by expanding my business to 3 different cities this year”.\nYou need to have a solid belief in the working pattern of the universe. Once the wish is finalised, ask for the same to the universe. There is no one way to do this. Some humans have interaction in prayer, while others meditate. There are people out there who write letters to the universe.\nSome use imaginative and prescient boards. You can choose your favoured technique or a mixture of all of them to put your request to the universe. The most essential part is to make it known – spoken, written or otherwise.\nTrust and Believe:\nPutting out your dream to the universe is good, but trust and belief are two quintessential elements in the process. Even though it might be challenging to put your trust into something you’ve never seen or comprehended with certainty, this part is necessary. Without trust, manifestations will never work.\nYou might have heard of the “ Law of Attraction ”, that’s what’s happening in the process. You are attracting your desires. The huge piece of manifestation has always been trust in the universe and its power. Never doubt it or question it.\nSimply sitting around and believing in the universe to make all the moves isn’t enough. You have to take steps to make your dreams come true. Even the slightest motion towards your desires can make amicable changes. Even the turtle steps matter.\nYou can also check out the Billionaire Bioscience Code reviews that will help improve the quality of your life and does this by ensuring that you are successful in all aspects of life and live in the way that you always desired.\nDon’t look back:\nSuccess is never easy, there can be hurdles in the way. Challenges occur as you cross through the manifestation process, however focus on your goal. The major setbacks in the manifestation process are poor mindset and negative people.\nIt is good for you to distance yourself from people giving negative energy. By being vigilant about the forces that are preventing you from manifesting your goals you can tackle them.\nJournaling, Affirmations and Vision Boards need to be in your daily activity list. Dedicate a journal for the sole purpose of manifestation. Write down your dreams as if they have already happened.\nAffirmations are a superb way to hold your ideas and movements intentionally. Say positive affirmation everyday. Vision boards should depict your needs and desires. It is a visualisation technique. Practise all three methods everyday without fail until your dream comes true.\nRemember that you entice what you believe, so make an effort to maintain your inside vibration and take care of yourself. On your manifestation journey, it is critical to acknowledge your progress. When you notice signs and symptoms of manifestation, be grateful to the universe.\nYou need to maintain a positive relationship with the universe throughout the process. Be positive in your thoughts and actions. Maintain good relations with people around you and help people whenever you can. When you help someone, the universe helps you!", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}

Hebrew legend maintains that each fruit holds 613 seeds, one for each mitzvah (good deed) recounted in the Torah.\nPomegranates have been dubbed “nature’s most labor-intensive fruit.” That’s unfortunate because the contents are well worth a bit of effort. The juice stains with a vengeance—it’s a traditional dye for Persian rugs—but that hurdle is easily overcome by working underwater.\nTo extract the arils, or seeds, fill a large bowl with water. Plunge the pomegranate under the surface and use a paring knife to cut off the crown along with a bit of the core (sort of like hulling a strawberry.) Keeping the pomegranate submerged, insert your thumbs into the core and pry the fruit into sections. Use your fingers to loosen seeds from the pithy membranes—the seeds conveniently sink, while the membrane floats to the top. Pour off the water and membranes, reserving the precious seeds. Eat the seeds out of hand, use them in recipes, or freeze them for up to a year.\nOne pomegranate yields about 3/4 cup of seeds, which yield 1/3 to 1/2 cup of juice. For juice, process the seeds in blender, and pour through a strainer, pressing with the back of a spoon to release as much juice as possible.

In the mid-1980s, after a number of personnel changes, the group settled on the line-up of artists Paul Panhuysen and Mario van Horrik, musician Jan van Riet, and scientist Leon van Noorden, which remained stable until Panhuysen's death in 2015. The group met and played on a regular basis, usually improvising on instruments that were at hand and recording every session. Before playing the next session, the previous recording was listened to and discussed. In 1980, the Eindhoven art initiative Het Apollohuis, also the home of Panhuysen and his family, became their home base, a place that subsequently gained fame for being one of the first and longest-running venues for sound art and experimental music in Europe.\nIn the recent years, the Maciunas Ensemble has begun to go through its vast archive of recordings and to select material for publication that remained unreleased so far. The first bundle of archival recordings, dating from 1968 to 1980, was released on an 11-CD set on Apollo Records in 2012. For their 50th anniversary in 2018, the second part of archival recordings is to be published, its first instalment being this LP on Edition Telemark comprising unreleased tracks recorded between 1982 and 2012. More archival material will be released in digital format by the ensemble.\nThis LP allows a glimpse into the musical directions the Maciunas Ensemble has been undergoing during those 30 years. Side A features \"Ice Cream Man\" and \"Toxic Metals\", two repetitive, thundering tracks from the early 1980s played on guitar, piano, and cello, and heavily inspired by minimalist rock and post-punk music. Side B contains four shorter tracks: \"Russolution\" (1985), played on self-built aluminium monochords, \"Stamples\" (2002), employing sampled voices, and \"ZENder\" (2009) and \"Dèdeboum\" (2012), both improvised tracks on vocals and a number of instruments.\nRegular edition of 250 in brown Kraftpak sleeve with printed inner sleeve containing various photos of the ensemble and liner notes by Mark van de Voort and Werner Durand.

{"id": "1694", "text": "A few years ago my father was informed by the doctor, after some tests, that he suffered from allergies: several, in fact, one of which was cats.\nBeing the cat person that I am, and in view of the fact that at the time my parents still had Tiger, an old friend (with an admittedly unimaginative name), the news struck me hard. (A lot harder than my father, who never had much to do with Tiger beyond occasionally throwing him out of a chair.)\nWhat if I had inherited this allergy? I thought in horror. How would I cope? My course of action seemed clear: never let a doctor test me for allergies.\nFor others, it’s not that simple, because allergies can make you just as miserable as a real disease — not surprising, since the symptoms of both result from the activation of your immune system. It’s just that, with an allergy, it’s actually something harmless your body is responding to with sneezing, watery eyes, nasal congestion, a rash, an upset stomach, hives, lung spasms (as in asthma), or a combination of any or all of these.\nThe most severe reaction, usually in response to bee or wasp stings, penicillin or other drugs or certain foods, is anaphylactic shock, characterized by a severe drop in blood pressure, an itchy rash or hives, breathing difficulty, abdominal pain, swelling of the tongue or throat and diarrhea. It can lead to asphyxiation and death.\nAn allergic reaction begins when the immune system, mistaking, say, ragweed pollen for a virus, manufactures special antibodies called immunoglobulin E, or IgE for short. These combine with the allergen molecules and attach themselves to special cells that release histamine and other compounds that affect the blood vessels and mucous membranes, leading to swelling and congestion.\nStrangely, you don’t react to the substance you’re allergic to the first time you’re in contact with it: you react the second, or third, or even the thousandth, because it may take that many exposures for your immune system to become sensitized to the allergen. That’s why allergies can seem to appear overnight.\nDetermining what ‘s causing the allergic reaction isn’t easy. Doctors consider medical history and symptoms, and sometimes give the test my father underwent, in which small doses of common allergens are injected just below the skin. Redness and swelling can indicate allergies. (Unfortunately, sometimes you get redness and swelling anyway!)\nThe best way to avoid an allergic reaction is to avoid the stuff you’re allergic to. This can be difficult if you’re allergic to something ubiquitous like house dust, especially since you’re not really allergic to dust, but to a protein produced by the mites that live in it. It’s impossible to escape dust mites, since two million of them live in the average mattress and a dozen or more are probably nibbling skin flakes in your eyebrows right now. Pollen is similarly almost impossible to avoid. And many cat and dog-lovers, like me, are unwilling to give up their pets, allergies or no allergies.\nWith these people, doctors sometimes try desensitization, injecting small amounts of the substance that causes the allergy under the skin: enough to cause the body to make antibodies, but not enough to trigger an allergic reaction. Through repeated injections, the body learns not to attack the substance.\nMaking these shots requires companies like Sweden’s Allergon to vacuum weed pollen from fields, pull the stings out of wasps and bees, collect, freeze-dry and powder the hair of dogs, cows, cats and reindeer, gather horse dander, and breed dust mites (which are also ground, freeze-dried and powdered) in human dandruff purchased from Swedish barber shops. Sounds like a fun place to work, doesn’t it?\nThese treatments help some people a lot, others a little, and some not at all. Sometimes all that can be done is treating the symptoms, with antihistamines, anti-inflammatory drugs or decongestants.\nA better method could be on the way, though: in 1986 scientists identified the receptors in the immune system’s cells into which the IgE antibodies “plug,” triggering the allergic reaction. In a decade or so there may be drugs to block these receptors.\nUntil then, I’m afraid my final word on the subject must be “Gesundheit!”", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}

NGOs are required to register with the Hungarian authorities as ‘organisations in receipt of support from abroad’ when the amount of donations they received in a given year reached a threshold. When registering, NGOs also have to indicate the name of donors whose support reaches or exceeds 500,000 Hungarian forints (1,500 euros) and the exact amount of the support. That information is later published on a free, publicly accessible e-platform.\nCritics have long claimed that the law has served as a tool to stigmatise and silence independent voices.\nAdvocate General Manuel Campos Sánchez-Bordona said that these conditions apply solely in the case of donations coming from abroad, as a result of which they are much more likely to affect nationals of other member states than Hungarians.\nMr Sánchez-Bordona is of the opinion that the conditions amount to a restriction of the principle of free movement of capital, both with regard to the organisations affected, which may have to cope with financing difficulties and whose exercise of the right to freedom of association may be limited, and their foreign donors, who may be dissuaded from making donations on account of the possible stigmatising effect of the publication of the details of those transactions, because they express an ideological affinity that might be compromising in the Hungarian national context.\nWhile such a law might be justified if it aimed at protecting of public policy and the fight against money laundering and terrorist financing, the government is not legitimate in imposing, ex ante, such obligations on all civil organisations.\n“There is no final decision yet,” Péter Krekó, director of the think tank Political Capital, tells Emerging Europe. “If the law will be abolished, it will be a huge blow for the government and a symbolic victory for the NGOs.”\n“The Hungarian government should respond to criticism with arguments and dialogue, not by stigmatising and silencing dissenters,” reads a statement from Amnesty International Hungary. “The fact that the Lex NGO is considered to be in breach of EU law also by the Advocate General strengthens our hope that the law, targeting organisations daring to criticise the government, will fall before the Luxembourg court as well, and the judgment will result in the Lex NGO having to be repealed.”\nMr Krekó now expects verbal attacks against NGOs to intensify.\n“If [the Hungarian ruling party] Fidesz has to leave the EPP [European Peoples’ Party], I think they will go even more uninhibited in their attacks,” he says. “This decision, if made, will be important but we should not forget that Hungary is a country where the rule of law has deteriorated a lot and illiberal practices do not always respect legal barriers.”\nFidesz was temporarily suspended from the EPP last year, although the party’s MEPs remain part of the EPP group within the European Parliament. Some analysts believe that Fidesz may jump before it is pushed, with the Fidesz leadership currently exploring the possibility of joining Poland’s ruling Law and Justice party in the European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR) group.", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}

{"id": "1705", "text": "Popular Science Monthly/Volume 20/February 1882/Sanitary Relations of the Soil II\n|SANITARY RELATIONS OF THE SOIL.\nBy Dr. MAX VON PETTENKOFER.\nWATER plays quite as important a part in the soil as air. Obviously, no organic life, no organic change, can be conceived of without water; and we ourselves consist three parts in four of water. Therefore it may be inferred that change in the moisture of the soil must have a certain influence on its organic and organized constituents, and on the organic life within it. Two degrees of moisture in the soil may be especially distinguished: one in which air and water both occupy the pores, and one in which the pores are quite filled with water excluding the air. In the former case we may speak of soilmoisture (Bodenfeuchtigkeit), in the latter of ground-water (Grundwasser). In many cases, but not universally, the transition from soilmoisture to ground-water is very plainly indicated.\nThe coincidence of the existence of ground-water with the prevalence of typhoid has been a constantly recognized fact since 1856. It was discovered by Buhl, has been tested by Seidel according to the law of probabilities, and has been followed out and confirmed down to the present day by Port for the garrison at Munich, and by Ziemssen for the avenues of the civil hospitals; by whom it is shown that, when the amount of ground-water is above the average, fewer, when it is below the average, more, cases of typhus appear. The same law was discovered by Virchow for the fluctuations of typhus in Berlin. The lowest degree of saturation exists in Berlin during the later summer and the fall, in Munich during the winter, and the seasons of typhus are correspondingly different in the two cities: the latter part of summer and the fall in Berlin, winter in Munich. When the summer is unusually dry at Munich, summer epidemics prevail there also.\nThat the cause of these conditions is not the ground-water in and of itself, but the moisture in the overlying strata and the processes dependent upon it, is very plainly shown by two facts: first, that some typhus-centers have a porous soil but no ground-water; and, second, that the level of the ground-water may be raised and depressed by artificial means, as by damming, pumping, or draining, without any notable influence being produced upon the prevalence of typhus. The first case occurs in places where on account of the steepness of the descent, or of any other cause, no ground-water collects on the lower impervious strata; the second case, where the level of the groundwater is within the mark of the flood-height of a river. In Munich, for example, it was necessary on one occasion, in order to carry on some excavations in a part of the city near the Isar, to leave a gate in the river open for several months, so that the water sunk more than a metre. No increase of typhus was observed; and when the gate was closed, and the water was allowed to rise again to its original height, the typhus did not diminish. A coincidence with the prevalence of typhus appears only when the variations in the level of the ground-water proceed from the saturation or the drying-up of the strata lying above it. I have always regarded the state of the groundwater only as the best and plainly visible sign or index of the rhythm of the soil-moisture in the overlying strata.\nMacpherson, Lewis, and Cunningham have shown beyond a doubt that the cholera fluctuates in its home in India, like abdominal typhus with us, inversely with the annual amount of rain and of saturation of the soil. It behaves in the same way with us. The remarkable division of the cholera into a summer and a winter epidemic, which was observed in Munich in 1873 and 1874, can be explained only by reference to the conditions of the soil as to moisture. The epidemic began at the end of an abnormally dry July, prevailed with extraordinary violence till the beginning of August, became stationary about two weeks afterward, and seemed wholly to have disappeared at the end of October, only to break out anew with greater violence in November after a long spell of dry weather, and continued till the end of April, 1874. The city of Augsburg, nine miles from Munich, suffered more severely in proportion than that city in 1874, but was quite free from cholera in 1873, notwithstanding many cases were introduced. It had thirty per cent more rain in that year than Munich.\nI can not go further into the consideration of these circumstances; I only cite them as evidence of the influence of moisture in the soil so far as it is measurable by the proportion of ground-water present. We are more nearly concerned with the relation of the soil to the water which we apply to our own use, which we draw from wells and springs, to water as a vehicle conveying matters out from the soil. When typhus or cholera rages epidemically in any place, two parties immediately set up a contention as to whether the epidemic influence proceeds from the water or the air. It must be admitted henceforth that either is possible, that a so-called sickly soil can impart its noxious properties equally to the water and to the air it contains, but it may also be that only one of these ways is possible as to certain matters and lower organisms. Observation and experiment must decide upon that. Most physicians have hitherto considered that infection was probably most directly conveyed through the water, and the so-called drinking-water theory has been developed from this view. It has, however, been ascertained that the best known infectious agent in the soil, the Bacillus malariæ, which Klebs and Tommasi-Crudelli have discovered and studied in the Roman fever-districts, can not live without air. These investigators found that the malarial poison was not communicated to the water that stood over a richly malarious mud. Tommasi says, in his latest work on the Roman malaria and the ancient drainage of the Roman hills, that \"the Bacillus malariæ is preeminently an air-living organism.\" Among the conditions favorable to its propagation in a malarial soil—which need not be a swamp-soil—Tommasi specifies a temperature of about 20° C. (68° Fahr.), a moderate degree of steady moisture, and the direct action of the oxygen of the air on all parts of the mass. He says further, \"The lack of one of these conditions is enough to cause a suspension of the development of the spores and of the increase of the malarial ferment.\" If any one, however, believes that this organism must also remain inoperative when it passes into our blood because that is a fluid, he should be reminded that it makes a great difference whether we put such organism, taken from their airy nests in a moist soil, into cold water, or into warm blood where air is supplied to them from the corpuscles.\nWe can not, indeed, answer, with the results of experiment and microscopical investigation, questions respecting the infectious diseases with the specific germs of which we are not acquainted, but we may be guided in the matter by other facts. Naegelli says: \"Contagion fungi can keep up their peculiar activity in water only for a short time. The purer it is the less food they find in it; they are very soon removed by exhaustion in clear spring-water; and, even in water that contains food for them and where they can multiply fast, degeneration quickly sets in, and they are changed into common ferments.\"\nInasmuch as we are not acquainted with the germs of typhus and cholera except through their infectious operation, we can not, so long as we use at the same time the air and the water of the infected place, decide whether the epidemic germ is imparted to us by the water or by the air. If only one of the elements could be used while the other could be entirely excluded, we might anticipate a time when investigation should bring us to a decision on the subject. Many cases are now known where cholera and typhus have run their course without any part of the local water having been used as drinking-water, but not a single case where the local air was excluded while the local water was used. A severe epidemic of typhus that prevailed in the city of Basle last fall and winter enforced the lesson that not even the purest water, brought from far away in the Jura, could afford protection against those diseases. With this fact the probability, in cases where the epidemic influence can be ascribed to both the air and the water, that it exists in the water, falls to a minimum. We may then ask, Why might not the infection in these cases have been brought out from the soil by the air? It is not my intention to argue here, where discussion is not possible, against the drinking-water theory; I only call attention to the fact that the most convincing proof of it is wanting. My disbelief in it, however, does not prevent my desiring pure and abundant water for all dwelling-places of man, for we need it, not only as a means of protection against typhus and cholera, but for the daily use of sick and well; not only for the sake of cleanliness and for food, but also as a luxury.\nThe examination of the fungoids has brought out many facts of great hygienic importance, among them some that concern organic life in the soil. I acknowledge the fact gratefully, but can not abstain from indicating a few points which show the necessity of being guarded in practical hygiene against too hasty conclusions. Mycology would assume more than belongs to it, if it should imagine that hygiene was first placed on a scientific foundation or that it first reached a scientific standing when the cultivation of bacteria was begun, or that it had nothing more to do in the future than to look into the microscope and work with the steaming-pot and wadding-stopper. The professional hygienist has still much else to do; but if he keeps himself familiar with the results of the investigation of the germs, then we may have another hygienist who shall make as beneficial a use of them as the surgeon Lister has made of the investigations of Pasteur and others in his antiseptic bandage. The mycologist did not deduce the ultimate practical results—that belonged to the surgeon; and on this ground I believe that the hygienist is not yet a superfluous piece of furniture.\nThe mycologists have told us, for example, that particular solutions and concentrations of the same are essential for certain ferments or certain of their properties, and that they thrive weakly or not at all in fluids otherwise constituted. A fluid may contain all the necessary constituents, but be too diluted or too concentrated. We may consider all putrefaction and decay of suitable substances, the refuse of our households, the waste water with which we irrigate and manure the soil, as affording food-fluids for the lower organisms. Then we might think—and the like has been thought and said—that dirt is not dangerous to health if it is only properly concentrated. It has been asserted that there is much more dirt in the country and in the villages where citizens go—as they say—to get the air, than in the city. A closer investigation would, however, show that there is a real difference between the city and the village, between country life and city life, but not between the consequences of filth in the city and in the country. Cleanly kept houses are healthier than dirty ones, even in the country. The villages, however, are only apparently filthier than the cities. Indeed, the great density of the population of the cities is in itself like a concentration of the filth, and the scattering of the dwellings in the country is like a dilution of it. In the villages the manure-heaps are on top of the ground and open to the air, which, ventilating them freely, effects a salutary dilution and change: in the cities we do not bring the dirt out into the yard, but we deposit it by the walls of our houses; we do not let the free atmosphere work upon it, but try to keep it away from the air as much as possible by inclosing it in pits which are well covered and arched over, but are connected with the house by invisible pipes and canals. We let nothing escape into the free air, but believe that we Heed not regard what reaches the ground under the house and the air within the house. In the cities we insist very much on outward cleanliness, that the dirt must not be exposed, and cover it up beautifully in our houses and yards, so as to make the impression that there is none, as a dirty skin and foul linen may be covered by handsome outer garments.\nAdmitting that there may be a kind or amount of concentration of filth in the soil that will prevent the growth of certain ferments, as the development of fermenting bacteria and fungoids is prevented in fruits by seething them in concentrated sirups, hygiene has yet to ascertain how highly concentrated filth in the soil must be to prevent the ferments in it that contribute to cholera and typhus from being effective. It should also be borne in mind that even if a sufficiently high degree were reached at any place on the premises, as, for example, in a cesspool, that concentration would cease and a favorable degree of dilution would take its place, somewhere in the neighborhood, at a greater or less distance from the focus of filth. We should therefore always insist upon the degree of cleanliness which we understand to promote the greatest possible prevention and dilution of filth, as our hygienic aim; and we shall furthermore do well, if we remove not only from our houses, but from the neighborhood, and keep removed, all that seems to us to be dirt, and offends our innate æsthetic feelings.\nThe mycologists have further taught us that no germs escape from fluids and moist objects by mere evaporation, but that they only pass into the air in the form of dust, or when gases are generated and puff out, or when something adheres to things that are washed with such moist objects. We might be tempted to conclude from this that nothing more is necessary, to make and keep our abodes free from disease, than to keep everything properly moist. But, aside from the fact that damp houses and damp soils are positively disadvantageous to health, it would not be possible to maintain such a degree of moisture or other conditions that it should never be too dry, that there should never be any spurts of gas, and that no germs should ever be washed off. We can judge of the uselessness of such efforts from the fact that no one has ever found air, either out-of-doors when it has rained incessantly for a long time, nor in a house where it is still moist, that was free from mold. We attach more importance to the fact, likewise established by mycologists, that all germs flourish only in fluids and damp media, and that moist walls, not dry ones, become moldy.\nIf moisture really afforded protection against the escape of germs, we might imagine the drains and sink-holes connected with our houses to furnish the best kind of drainage, because they are always moist, and contribute something to the required moisture in the soil. I consider these sinks close to the house to be dangerous neighbors, even when they are designed only to carry off rain-water. I proceed upon the time-honored experience of physicians that certain malarious diseases prevail most actively in damp spots in houses and villages situated in hollow places or at the foot of slopes, after inundations. A sink is an artificial trough, an artificial flood-region for each house, into which is concentrated the drainage from the roof and from the surrounding ground. By it a certain part of the house-ground is exposed to occasional floods, which can have no other results for the house than the occasional inundations in a larger region have for the places lying within it. When such pits are unavoidable, it is well to have them as far as possible from the house; but it would be better to conduct the water coming from the roof or elsewhere to some place where it can no longer prejudice our health. I look upon the removal or great diminution of these sinks as constituting the chief advantage of the sewerage of cities. The hygienic value of sewerage may have been sometimes exaggerated—there was a time when many believed that it would remove all sickness, and it would not be surprising if the reaction against this exaggeration should lead to an undue depreciation—but it is an established fact that every city that has completed a well flushed system of sewerage in connection with house-drainage has gained in health, and that its death-rate, especially from diseases connected with the soil, has diminished. I mention the reports, on the frequency of typhus before and after sewerage, of John Simon for the English cities, of Varrentrapp for Frankfort-on-the-Main, and of Lievin for Dantzic. We hear, indeed, that the general prevalence of typhus has ceased, and that its disappearance in these cities is wrongly placed to the credit of costly sanitary works; but the coincidence must be full of significance to every unprejudiced person that the disappearance of typhus in different cities has not taken place simultaneously and in the same degree, but has generally begun with the introduction of water-works and sewers. In Hamburg, for instance, improvement began to be evident in 1848, and in Dantzic in 1872. If now we conclude that the genius epidemicus has undergone a change, this genius must have manifested a wicked partiality for Hamburg and a devilish maliciousness toward Dantzic, to have kept the latter city so long in his claws. Soyka recently communicated to the meeting of the German Sanitary Union a statistical report respecting the typhus in Munich, in which the influence of sewerage was set forth in the plainest manner, perhaps more plainly than it has been done in any other case. It is known by long experience in this city that abdominal typhus, when it is epidemic, prefers certain quarters, including sewered and unsewered parts alike, and that it spares certain quarters, including sewered and unsewered parts alike; showing that the disease is generally connected with the local situation, not with the existence or nonexistence of sewers. Now, Soyka has found that between 1866 and 1880 typhus diminished in the unsewered and the old and badly sewered parts of the city, in round numbers, only ten per cent, in the favorably situated and well-sewered parts about twenty per cent, in the unfavorably situated but well-sewered parts about forty per cent'. That the wonderful result in the last case was accomplished by sewerage becomes obvious when it is considered that in it an otherwise fertile typhus-field, in which more seed was to be destroyed, had to be dealt with. Such facts make it very hard for the opponents of sewerage to continue to deny its hygienic advantages.\nA well-regulated system of sewerage with adequate flushing not only promotes the removal of much filth, but also effects a great dilution of all soluble and floating dirt, and contributes toward rendering it harmless and effecting its complete destruction. The opponents of sewerage insist that it is impossible to construct a perfectly tight system of sewers. This is not essential; it is enough to reduce the quantity of impurities penetrating into the soil, so far as they are of an organic nature, to so low a degree that they shall he quickly changed and rendered harmless by the soil. The ground has a certain power to purify itself.\nFalck made the discovery not long ago that water containing infectious matter, formed and unformed ferments, organic poisons, etc., ran off pure after having been filtered through very thin beds of sand. At first, the ground only absorbs, as, for example, finely pulverized coal removes matters from fluids; but Soyka has found that under conditions of sufficient dilution and exposure to air a real destruction of the absorbed organic matter also takes place, so that even substances that are otherwise unchangeable, as, for instance, strychnine, are as completely destroyed by it as if they had been burned in the fire. This explains why the soils of many places that have been inhabited from the earliest times so frequently look to the naked eye, when they are dug over, like virgin soils. Traces of impurity are visible only in places where more is demanded of the ground than it can perform. It is therefore not surprising that the ground under the sewers of Hamburg does not appear to have been contaminated to any great extent. Wolffhügel's investigations, on the other hand, show that the ground under cesspools and drains, in which filth accumulates in a more concentrated form than in flushed sewers, presents a very different appearance. Professor Hofmann's most recent investigations in the soil of the streets of Leipsic show that the ground under the bottom of even badly built sewers is much cleaner than that over their tops or that under the pavements.\nVery instructive are the researches of Emmerich, showing that various kinds of foul water, which are sure to kill when injected under the skin of rabbits, become harmless as soon as they are shaken up with common sand, or if they are diluted with a certain proportion of pure water.\nEvery foul soil which we. cease to pollute purifies itself again in the course of time, and every clean soil, to which no more impurity is introduced than it can work up, remains clean. It is certainly interesting that this purification of the ground is dependent for the most part on the activity of the lowest organisms, as has been proved with reference to the conversion of nitrogenous organic matters in the ground into nitric salts, or to what is called nitrification, by the researches of Schlösing and Müntz. We know as little of the nitrifying germ in the ground as we do of the cholera and typhus germs, but we can and must judge of it by its works. We learn from its operations that the representatives of the lowest organic life, of the cell-life, perform not merely injurious but also very useful functions, that they are not merely noxious or poisonous plants; and we need not be surprised if a later age, when more has been learned in these matters than is now known, shall cultivate the useful bacteria, and make war only upon the injurious ones.\nAs there are soils which are more easily nitrified than others, so there are those which more readily bring forth disease than others; and it is the duty of hygiene to search further into the biological processes going on in the ground. We are still very far from the end: a boundless sea of probabilities lies before us; but that need not prevent our weighing anchor and spreading sail.\nHitherto we have allowed ourselves to be guided in hygienic practice and technics predominantly by the feelings, instincts, and what we call common sense, and have only very recently begun to establish our practice, which is, indeed, very primitive, on a scientific and experimental footing. Dirt and impurity have till now been somewhat indefinite conceptions. We use the terms whenever our innate or cultivated sense of cleanliness is unpleasantly affected; they are generally called out by impressions on our sense of smell, taste, or sight. What we call cleanliness plays an important part in daily life, in a similar manner to that which conscience, the sense of right and wrong, partly innate, partly inculcated, plays in our moral life. Just as it can be regarded as a fact that conscientious men as a rule accomplish more and better than unconscientious, so cleanly men as a rule are healthier and live longer than uncleanly men. As conscience is more or less developed in different degrees of human civilization, so also is the sense of cleanliness. Under the guidance of analogous feelings, we have instinctively and empirically found out what it is to our advantage to eat and drink, and how we should clothe ourselves, before these subjects could be dealt with scientifically.\nOur established hygiene also was probably based in the first instance chiefly on the suggestions of feeling. Those who are moving in the new scientific direction should guard against considering all that is not scientifically confirmed as wrong and unfounded, but they should also not hesitate to subject established rules to a thorough scientific and experimental criticism. This will necessarily teach us that mere feeling has dictated much to us that rests upon false suppositions, and can either be omitted or must be changed. Practice or technics always precedes science. Our branches of trade and industry also began on empiric roads, and were carried on in them for thousands of years; but how greatly have they been changed, improved, and simplified, and how many new branches have arisen since we began to apply the sciences of physics, chemistry, and mechanics to them!\nHygiene, or the science of health, has a widely extended field of labor in laying a scientific foundation for our sanitary regimen. Even if in many cases it only shows that all is not as it has heretofore been supposed to be, that has its great practical value. What harm did it do to medical practice that the Vienna medical school in its day showed up the errors of the then prevailing views, and radically assailed the practice founded upon them which had been adopted for centuries? An analogous example in contemporary hygiene was afforded at the meeting of the German Public Health Association, when Hofmann and Siegel showed by the light of experimental researches and exact observations that our church-yards and burial-grounds, provided the soil is in a proper condition, and a proper, easily applied restorative treatment is adopted, are not so detrimental to the ground-water and air, and consequently to the health of persons living near them, as has been heretofore believed, but that the water from wells inside of the church-yards is generally purer than that in the inhabited places around them, so that in this respect we have more to fear from the living than from the dead. We are injured by our method of burial quite as little as we were injured when systematic blood-letting in inflammatory diseases was abandoned in consequence of the observations of Skoda and Rokitansky.\nIt will not be otherwise with hygienic practice than it has been with therapeutics, if we now begin to apply a scientific method to it. May the medical faculties and the government speedily grant means to do it! The most beneficial practical results will not fail to be realized.\n- An address delivered before the Association of German Naturalists and Physicians, at Salzburg, September 18, 1881.", "scores": {"score": 4, "score_transform_1": 5, "score_transform_2": 5, "score_transform_3": 0}}

{"id": "1722", "text": "Just as people are becoming more conscious about the ingredients in the products they use on their skin, consumers are rejecting hair care products that are manufactured with unnecessary chemicals. Sulphates are the latest point of contention in the hair care world – discover what role sulphates play in your hair care products and the benefits of making the switch to sulphate-free.\nWhat are sulphates in hair care?\nSulphates are chemical compounds that contain a sulphate ion as part of their molecular structure. They lower the surface tension between two liquids, a liquid and a solid or a liquid and a gas. Occurring widely in everyday life, sulphates are used in various industrial, commercial, and household applications – as well as in the personal care industry.\nIn beauty and hair care products, sulphates are often added to create frothy lathers – meaning they are surfactants. One of the most common sulphates used in hair care is sodium lauryl sulphate (SLS) – but it is also used widely in household cleaning products such as detergent because of its ability to lather and create a foam.\nWhat are the environmental impacts of sulphates?\nWhile sulphates do occur naturally in the environment, studies have shown that one third of the sulphur reaching the environment is generated from industrial activities. Sulphates in the environment are capable of causing harm and can damage vegetation, soils, watercourses and building materials.\nAs well as this, the way in which sulphates are produced and disposed of can also harm the environment. Sulphates can contribute to water pollution and soil degradation when released into the environment in excessive amounts. While each bottle of sulphate or SLS shampoo won’t be releasing sulphates into the environment in excessive amounts, every bit that washes down the drain adds up.\nBenefits of sulphate-free hair care\nWe’ve covered the environmental effects of sulphates, but their impacts don’t stop there – they also impact anyone coming into contact with them through their personal and hair care products. Discover why you should make the switch to sulphate-free hair care.\n1. Helps to retain your natural oils\nIn hair care, sulphates are known to strip away the natural scalp oils that help to keep both the scalp and hair nourished. This often leads to dry, brittle hair that’s crying out for a hit of moisture.\nSulphate-free hair care does not harshly strip the scalp of its oils – while still cleansing the hair and scalp of impurities – and so helps to maintain the balance of these essential natural oils. A moisturised and nourished scalp is a key factor in your hair’s health and appearance, supporting strong, shiny and soft locks.\nFor more information on how to keep your hair happy and healthy, take a look at our guide to scalp care.\n2. Gentler for sensitive scalps\nWhen used in both skincare and hair care, sulphates can irritate the skin. This is especially true for anyone suffering with a sensitive scalp, or a skin condition that can flare up. This is because not only does the product wash your hair, but it also comes into contact with your scalp, the edges of your face, your neck and body as it washes out.\nUsing sulphate-free hair products means you can get your fix of all the hair care goodies needed to protect your hair and scalp without worrying about potential irritation, redness and itching from using sulphates such as SLS.\n3. Helps to maintain dyed hair\nJust as sulphates strip the natural oils from your scalp, they can also strip the colour from dyed hair. This can cause the dye to fade more quickly, which means more trips to the salon. By choosing a sulphate-free shampoo, you can help to preserve both the longevity and the vibrancy of colour-treated hair.\n4. Reduces hair and scalp dryness\nNot only do sulphate-free hair care products help to retain the scalp’s natural oils, they also can also help to nourish both the hair and scalp. Adding in a hit of moisture while cleansing the hair of dirt and impurities, sulphate-free shampoos help to reduce the risk of dry and brittle hair.\nSulphate-free hair care: FAQs\nNow that we've been through the basics of sulphate-free hair care, we’ll cover some of our most frequently asked questions about hair care products that don’t include any sulphates.\nIs sulphate-free shampoo good for hair?\nYes – sulphate-free shampoo is a great option for your hair care routine, gently cleansing the hair of dirt and impurities that have built up without stripping the scalp of the natural oils it needs. The best sulphate-free hair products are created using high quality natural ingredients, so don’t presume that all sulphate-free shampoo is created equally.\nDoes sulphate free-shampoo cause hair loss?\nNo, sulphate-free shampoo does not cause hair loss. In fact, shampoos that contain sulphates such as SLS are more likely to cause hair thinning and potentially hair loss due to their harsh cleansing properties.\nDoes sulphate free-shampoo make your hair greasy?\nSulphate-free shampoo does not make your hair greasy, but if you’re used to the squeaky-clean feeling after using a shampoo with sulphates, your hair may feel different at first. This is because sulphate-free hair care gently cleanses the hair rather than harshly stripping it of the natural oils.\nSulphate-free hair products: UpCircle’s Shampoo Crème\nIf you know anything about UpCircle, you’ll know that our environmental ethics are close to our hearts and reflected in each and every product we produce. Giving a new lease of life to discarded ingredients by upcycling them into skin and hair care products, UpCircle is committed to reducing our environmental impact.\nOur all-new Shampoo Crème with UpCycled Pink Berry Extract is formulated with scalp- and hair-loving ingredients to both cleanse the hair of impurities and nourish the hair. Strictly sulphate-free, our Shampoo Crème uses upcycled pink berry extract to cleanse and strengthen the hair and scalp without stripping it, unlike many chemical shampoos that use surfactants such as sulphates.\nEach and every ingredient in our shampoo is 100% natural and chosen for their hair care benefits. We use upcycled pink berry extract to help improve scalp conditions such as dry and itchy scalps, and source this from local family-owned plantations in Madagascar – here, it is a by-product of natural fragrance ingredient manufacturing.\nYou’ll also find deeply nourishing coconut oil to nourish the hair as well as prevent frizz and breakages, alongside grapefruit oil to help fight free radical damage. Housed in a glass jar, our shampoo crème has joined the ranks of the refillable, helping to reduce waste.\nTreat your hair to our new Sulphate-Free Shampoo Crème for hair and scalp-loving ingredients with an added hit of nourishment.", "scores": {"score": 3, "score_transform_1": 5, "score_transform_2": 5, "score_transform_3": 0}}

These are primarily generated by fuel combustion in sectors including transport, energy, households, industry, and from agriculture.\nUnder the new guidelines, WHO halved the recommended limit for average annual PM2.5 level from 10 micrograms per cubic meter to 5. It also lowered the recommended limit for PM10 from 20 micrograms to 15.\n“Almost 80% of deaths related to PM2.5 could be avoided in the world if the current air pollution levels were reduced to those proposed in the updated guideline,” it said, referring to particulate matter of 2.5 microns in diameter.\n“What matters most is whether governments implement impactful policies to reduce pollutant emissions, such as ending investments in coal, oil and gas and prioritizing the transition to clean energy,” said Dr. Aidan Farrow, a Greenpeace international air pollution scientist who is based at Britain’s University of Exeter.\n“The failure to meet the outgoing WHO guidelines must not be repeated,” he said in a statement.", "scores": {"score": 3, "score_transform_1": 5, "score_transform_2": 5, "score_transform_3": 0}}

{"id": "1883", "text": "Now that the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has issued its three notices of proposed rulemakings regarding potential reform of the bloated and poorly targeted Universal Service funds (collectively, USF), analysts are pointing out once again that the agency should make USF reform a top priority this year.\nThe United States has a competitive marketplace with multiple choices of communications services using different technological platforms, they say, and the universal service regime needs a pretty radical overhaul.\nThis would mean changing the program to direct USF funds mostly to support consumers who demonstrate they need financial help, instead of the current policy of giving the money largely to communications providers who may use the support in ways that do not necessarily benefit under-served consumers or serve them in the most cost-effective, efficient ways.\nUnfortunately, serious USF reform is not likely in the near future. This makes it even more important for FCC to seize the opportunity this year to make some meaningful, even if modest, progress towards reforming the regime.\nFCC Commissioner Deborah Taylor Tate and Oregon Public Utility Commissioner Ray Baum deserve credit for their patient leadership of the Federal-State Universal Service Joint Board. The panel made some worthwhile recommendations to the commission in November of last year.\nJoint Board Recommendations\nIn line with the joint board’s recommendations, FCC should cap the size of the high-cost universal service fund at $4.5 billion; stop wireless carriers from receiving subsidies based on the “identical support” received by the incumbent wireline carriers, even though the wireless companies generally have lower costs; and adopt some form of “reverse auction” as a method of determining which communications providers can serve designated high-cost areas on the least-costly basis.\nA few of the joint board’s statements in its November 2007 Recommended Decision are especially noteworthy. Regarding the overall size of the high-cost subsidies, now at approximately $4.5 billion per year and growing, the board said this:\n“Many areas of government enterprise operate within a budget, and we think that high-cost funding can do likewise, provided that we are willing to make realistic estimates of the funding needed to meet the statutory requirement that we preserve and advance universal service. Over the longer term, we anticipate that total funding can and should be decreased as broadband and wireless infrastructure deployment becomes widespread throughout the country.”\nWithout delay, FCC should adopt the proposed cap on the size of the high-cost fund. This would stem the growth of the USF tax paid by all consumers, which currently stands at more than 10 percent of the consumer’s phone bill, in contrast to 6.8 percent in the first quarter of 2002.\nThe commission should move with more than its usual dispatch to adopt the joint board’s recommendation to eliminate the identical support rule, which provides support to wireless carriers without regard to costs. Regarding the wastefulness inherent in this element of the current regime, the board stated:\n“The Joint Board recognizes that the identical support rule has resulted in the subsidization of multiple voice networks in numerous areas and greatly increased the size of the high-cost fund. … We believe it is no longer in the public interest to use federal universal service support to subsidize competition and build duplicate networks in high-cost areas. … The rule bears little or no relationship to the amount of money competitive ETCs [Eligible Telecommunications Carriers] have invested in rural and other high-cost areas of the country.”\nFrom 2001 through 2007, taxpayers’ financial support to the competitive wireless carriers increased from $17 million to $1 billion, and much of this subsidy has not gone for build-outs to unserved areas.\nFinally, the commission should adopt some form of reverse auction, even if initially on some less-than-universal, experimental basis, to determine which provider (or providers) should be awarded subsidies to serve designated high-cost areas. The auction mechanism would encourage the provision of service on the most cost-effective, efficient basis and would spur the development of more innovative new network technologies.\nRealistically, designing and implementing an appropriate auction mechanism may well take most of the year. But there is no reason why FCC cannot adopt a high-cost fund cap right away. FCC Chairman Kevin Martin has endorsed the idea and has shown leadership on USF issues with Commissioner Tate.\nIt ought not to take many months, after all the discussion over the past couple of years and the work already done on the issue by the joint board, for the agency to adopt the recommended change in the identical support rule.\nMore comprehensive and fundamental reform of our nation’s communications laws and policies consistent with the new marketplace realities arguably may require several more years of congressional gestation and new presidential leadership. But in the meantime, FCC should set its sights on achieving meaningful progress this year in the cause of universal service reform.\nRandolph J.

{"id": "1955", "text": "Grilled kabobs are one of my favorite summer dinners. I make them for potlucks, sunset suppers on the back patio, or even when out camping with the family.\nThey’re easy, versatile, and oh so yummy! But they’re not necessarily the most filling of entrees, so you always need some good sides to go with them. And when it comes to kabobs, the possibilities endless.\nLuckily, I’ve narrowed it down to fourteen scrumptious side dishes that go so well with skewered meats and vegetables. From coconut rice to dinner rolls, here are the 14 best sides to serve with kabobs.\n1. Coconut Rice\nGrill up some Hawaiian-inspired chicken and pineapple skewers and make a big pot of coconut rice to continue the tropical flavors. This is perfect for a picnic, backyard barbecue, or just a cold day when you want to pretend you’re on a balmy beach vacation.\nSimply cook your rice in coconut milk instead of water, add a dash of brown sugar at the end, and you have the perfect side for your tropical kabobs.\nGo with a Mediterranean theme including pork kabobs (or even falafel balls), and mix up some easy cucumber yogurt dip. It will add a layer of refreshment to your grilled meal, plus offer some healthy probiotics.\nYou can dip your grilled meat and veggies in the yogurt mixture, or eat it as a subtle, chilled side salad. Yum!\nA freshly grilled corn cob dripping in butter and generously sprinkled with salt and pepper? Who could want for more?\nCorn on the cob is a classic side for any meal that involves pulling out the grill. Whether it’s steak and potato kebabs, skewered cherry tomatoes and peppers, or even some juicy shrimp that you’re grilling, corn on the cob goes with it all.\n4. Green Salad\nFor a meat-heavy kabob meal, go for an energizing green salad. Grab some romaine (or your preferred leafy greens), and tomatoes, and add some olive oil and balsamic vinegar for a zippy change up against your grilled meat.\nOr you can choose a classic cobb with boiled eggs for some extra protein and nutrients.\n5. Potato Salad\nAnother type of salad that goes well with grilled kabobs is a fortifying potato salad. Keep it simple with boiled potatoes, ranch dressing, onions, and celery for a quick and easy creamy side.\nOr go all out and prepare a full potato salad before you fire up the grill. Using mustard, mayo, boiled eggs, and relish makes for a mouth-watering, flavorful side.\n6. Corn Pudding\nA creamy corn casserole like you’ve never had before, a corn pudding is essentially a mix of cornbread and creamed corn. It offers a nice contrast in texture to your crunchy veggies and chewy meat, plus a touch of sweetness that is needed with all the savory flavors.\nThis custard-like side is great for holiday celebrations, or outdoor potlucks, and is so simple, you can even make it on busy work-nights.\nBaked, boiled, or fried, sweet potatoes are so diverse they can go with just about anything. With some skewered meats and vegetables, you might want a bit of starch to mix things up.\nI love baking sweet potato wedges for a healthy alternative to french fries, or mixing it up some bacon bits, spinach, and caramelized onions for twice-baked sweet potatoes.\nBut whatever your favorite sweet potato recipe is, it is sure to taste delicious next to your kebabs.\nInvigorate your taste buds with a tangy cucumber and tomato salad. Minus any greens, this salad is made up of sliced cucumbers, tomatoes, slivered red onions, and a zesty vinaigrette dressing.\nThis lively salad goes so well with marinated meats or fishes and it’s easy to mix up tasty variations. You can add other ingredients such as crumbled feta, mozzarella balls, avocado chunks, or chopped fennel to make it even more interesting and filling.\nGet your carbs in with a big helping of orzo. I love to make a Parmesan orzo that’s creamy and oh so cheesy. Plus, it tastes lovely next to chicken, beef, pork, or even tofu.\nOrzo is easier and faster than rice, too. Cook it up, add in some butter, cream, cheese, and whatever spices suit your fancy, and your set.\nIf you’re not including potato bites on your kabobs, roast up some potatoes, coat them in vinegar, olive oil, grated cheese, and a few tasty seasonings. This makes for a crispy, acidic treat that will leave everyone asking for more.\nIt’s absolutely crave-worthy, my mouth is watering just thinking about it. And don’t worry, they’re not TOO vinegar-y, so even if you don’t enjoy salt and vinegar chips, you’ll be able to dig into this tater side.\n11. Grilled Fruit\nKabobs are usually heavy on the veggies and rich flavors, so add in some variety with a few skewers of fruit instead. My favorite fruits to grill are pineapple, strawberries, melons, and big hunks of kiwi.\nGrilling them brings out the sugars and caramelizes them for a perfect after bbq dessert.\n12. Lemon Rice Pilaf\nA fragrant white rice, cooked in a rich, onion-y broth and plenty of lemon juice, pilaf is an appetizing accompaniment to grilled salmon, chicken, or shrimp. You can keep it simple or improvise with scallions, herbs, or pistachios. But whatever ingredients you use, rice pilaf is about to be your new go-to side.\n13. Pasta Salad\nA summer-time favorite, pasta salad is a nice way to have a cool side next to your steaming grilled kabobs. Pasta salads are easy, and offer a variety of veggies and flavors that you don’t get from your skewers.\nKeep it light with olives and Italian dressing, or go for a hearty version with sausage and cheese. And don’t forget your choice of noodle! I love using spiral rotini for the fun shape and semi-rough texture.\nNo meal is complete without some bread, am I right? Whip up some fluffy, golden dinner rolls and serve them with plenty of butter.\nYou can also take your grilled meats and veggies off their skewers and make your rolls into mini sandwiches. Or go one step further and make sliders.\nHam and cheese sliders, mini hamburgers, or even pizza topped rolls would all be sinfully good with your kabob dinner.\nWe are sorry that this post was not useful for you!\nLet us improve this post!\nTell us how we can improve this post?", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}
{"id": "1956", "text": "The Boston Red Sox enter the 2023 season with a couple of new names slotted into their starting rotation. The Red Sox are looking to bounce back this season after a disappointing 2022 season saw them finish last in the AL East with a 78-84 record which was five games behind the fourth-place Baltimore Orioles and 21 games behind the Division-winning New York Yankees. The Red Sox will need to be better across the board, from hitting to pitching, if they wish to compete not just for a playoff spot but in a loaded AL East. The Red Sox starting rotation will look a little different heading into this season as they will not have Nathan Eovaldi, Rich Hill, or Michael Wacha. This year’s rotation, if healthy to start the season, will feature Chris Sale, newcomer Corey Kluber, Nick Pivetta, James Paxton (missed all of last season), and Garrett Whitlock.\nThe oft-injured 33-year-old southpaw has pitched just 11 games over the last two seasons as injuries have kept him sidelined. Last season he appeared in just nine games before his season was cut short due to wrist surgery after he sustained a broken wrist while riding a bike. The Red Sox are hoping they can get a healthy Sale for this season, as they will need him if they wish to be successful. If Sale can return to 2018 form, the Sox will be in good shape, having their ace lead the way. In 2018 Sale posted a 12-4 record pitching in 158 innings with a 2.11 ERA and 237 strikeouts.\nOne of Chaim Bloom’s free agent signings of the offseason, the 36-year-old Kluber brings a veteran presence to the dugout. Red Sox fans are very familiar with Kluber’s work from his days as a Cleveland Indian, as well as spending the last two seasons playing for AL East rivals New York Yankees and Tampa Bay Rays. Kluber now finds himself on a new team for the fourth straight season as he continues to bounce around the MLB since departing Cleveland after the 2019 season. The veteran right-hander is coming off a season in which he started in 31 games, going 10-10 with a 4.34 ERA and 1.21 WHIP over 164 innings. Kluber held opposing hitters to a .274 average while striking out 139 batters.\nPivetta is gearing up for his fourth season with the Red Sox since coming over in a trade during the 2020 season from Philadelphia. Over the last two seasons, Pivetta has been a regular in the Red Sox’s rotation making over 30 starts each season. The 29-year-old right-hander will look to continue his solid work in Boston this year with hopes of having a lower ERA compared to the last two. Last season Pivetta started 33 games, going 10-12 with a 4.56 ERA and 1.38 WHIP. Pivetta did have 175 strikeouts which is the second-highest mark of his career. Over his 179.2 innings, he did hold hitters to a .253 average. Pivetta is once again set to be an innings eater for the Red Sox but must limit walks and home runs this season after giving up career highs in both last year.\nIt has been two years since James Paxton has appeared on a Major League mound. After getting Tommy John surgery in the 2021 season, Paxton was signed by the Red Sox that offseason. He was expected to be good to go sometime during the 2022 season but suffered a setback. He suffered a Grade 2 lat tear during a minor-league rehab start last August. Finally, on the mend, Paxton will get a chance to debut for the Sox in the 2023 season. The veteran southpaw last played a full season back in 2019, starting 29 games for the New York Yankees. He finished that season with 150.2 innings, a 3.83 ERA, and a 1.28 WHIP. He also added 186 strikeouts and held opponents to a .242 average. Paxton did appear in the 2020 season for the Yankees but only pitched in 20.1 innings. If Paxton can finally stay healthy and shake off the rust, he could play a key role in the back of the rotation.\nThe 26-year-old right-hander has been a stud for Boston since they drafted him in the rule five draft stealing him away from New York Yankees. Whitlock has been so good he was rewarded with a four-year extension last April, keeping him in Boston at least through 2026 with a team option for the 2027-2028 season. Whitlock is a player the Red Sox can use all over their rotation and bullpen as the right-hander can come out of the bullpen as a long-inning reliever or start games giving the Red Sox at least three to four innings before turning it over to the bullpen. The versatility of Whitlock is exactly what the Red Sox need in their fifth rotation spot, which can be switched up if Whitlock is needed back in the bullpen.\nLast season he was used in both roles as he appeared in 31 games and started nine of them. He pitched 78.1 innings, striking out 82 batters while holding his opponents to a .222 average.", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

Sometimes I stayed at my goal weight for 10 minutes, and sometimes I stayed longer, but eventually, they all ended the same way — every single one stopped working.\nAnd here’s why:\nDiets don’t work because they don’t help you understand and resolve why you eat when your body isn’t asking for more food.\nWhen you lose weight on a diet, you don’t lose the reasons why you emotionally eat. When your unresolved emotions return, so does your weight.\nWhen you feel fat and miserable, diets are incredibly appealing. We see thin, laughing women eating a 100-calorie yogurt in a commercial and think, “I want that.”\nOr you stumble upon a before/after picture on Instagram selling you the myth that for the low price of $99 you, too, can have a customized butt blasting workout program and lose 20 pounds in 2 weeks. Then, everything in your life will be fine.\nYou get that burst of hope and you’re filled with motivation and willpower. This time, it’s going to be different!\nExcept…it never is, is it?\nIt’s time to free yourself from diet prison.\nEvery morning you wake up hating your body, is another opportunity missed to stop feeling out of control around food.\nIf you’ve ever said:\n- “I can’t eat just a couple of bites and stop.”\n- “I have no self-control around sugar.”\n- “I avoid going out to eat since restaurants don’t have my food.”\nI was in your exact shoes, until I realized weight loss is like studying for a big test. You don’t try to memorize the whole book at once; you break it down into chapters and tackle it one paragraph at a time.\nAnd that’s exactly what I want to help you with.\nI want to show you how to change the unchangeable, achieve the unachievable, and lose weight while still eating the foods you love.", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

Nature 493:514-517.\nLegislation on biofuels production in the USA1 and Europe2, 3 is directing food crops towards the production of grain-based ethanol2, 3, which can have detrimental consequences for soil carbon sequestration4, nitrous oxide emissions5, nitrate pollution6, biodiversity7 and human health8. An alternative is to grow lignocellulosic (cellulosic) crops on ‘marginal’ lands9. Cellulosic feedstocks can have positive environmental outcomes10, 11 and could make up a substantial proportion of future energy portfolios12, 13. However, the availability of marginal lands for cellulosic feedstock production, and the resulting greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, remains uncertain. Here we evaluate the potential for marginal lands in ten Midwestern US states to produce sizeable amounts of biomass and concurrently mitigate GHG emissions. In a comparative assessment of six alternative cropping systems over 20 years, we found that successional herbaceous vegetation, once well established, has a direct GHG emissions mitigation capacity that rivals that of purpose-grown crops (−851 ± 46 grams of CO2 equivalent emissions per square metre per year (gCO2e m−2 yr−1)). If fertilized, these communities have the capacity to produce about 63 ± 5 gigajoules of ethanol energy per hectare per year. By contrast, an adjacent, no-till corn–soybean–wheat rotation produces on average 41 ± 1 gigajoules of biofuel energy per hectare per year and has a net direct mitigation capacity of −397 ± 32 gCO2e m−2 yr−1; a continuous corn rotation would probably produce about 62 ± 7 gigajoules of biofuel energy per hectare per year, with 13% less mitigation. We also perform quantitative modelling of successional vegetation on marginal lands in the region at a resolution of 0.4 hectares, constrained by the requirement that each modelled location be within 80 kilometres of a potential biorefinery. Our results suggest that such vegetation could produce about 21 gigalitres of ethanol per year from around 11 million hectares, or approximately 25 per cent of the 2022 target for cellulosic biofuel mandated by the US Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, with no initial carbon debt nor the indirect land-use costs associated with food-based biofuels. Other regional-scale aspects of biofuel sustainability2, such as water quality11, 14 and biodiversity15, await future study.\nAssociated Treatment Areas:\nT7 T6 T5 T2 T1Sign in to download PDF back to index", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}
{"id": "2085", "text": "Faux - Leather\nUnleash your senses, fashion aficionados, as we dive into the faux leather frenzy that's taking the world by storm. Kylie Jenner, the maestro of trends, recently birthed KHY, a brand that screams faux leather chic louder than a banshee at a rock concert. Picture this: a trenchcoat, body-con dress, and trousers that zip and unzip faster than your daily dilemmas. But here's the catch – these seemingly luxurious pieces are not leather at all. Nope, they're not swathed in the animal kingdom's finest; they're wrapped in the embrace of industrial-sized plastic.\nFaux leather the cool kid?\nThe high street, too, is playing faux leather roulette. Marks & Spencer is peddling high-waisted \"leather look\" leggings so popular, they're practically online royalty. Shein, the never-ending labyrinth of fashion, has so many pages of \"faux leather\" that you might need a GPS to navigate through it. It's a faux leather jungle out there, and we're all just trying to find our way back to sanity.\nFaux leather has been the cool kid on the block since the days of Grace Jones belting out \"Warm Leatherette\" in 1978. But here's the thing – most of these pleather wonders are by-products of the fossil fuel industry. We're essentially crafting a Frankensteinian material monster that's wreaking havoc on our planet like a gigantic, plastic version of Godzilla. The climate crisis is doing the cha-cha, and our ecosystems are throwing shade at our faux leather obsessions.\nNow, we get it – animal-free options sound ethical and virtuous. But, much like a vegan burger at a fast-food joint, a faux leather skirt might not be the healthiest or most eco-friendly choice. We need to save ourselves and stop sugar-coating plastic as the leather messiah. Let's call these materials out for what they are and let them face the music based on their own merits.\nSadly, our faux leather fantasies often end up as textile waste, gallivanting thousands of miles away from their birthplace. For example, faux leather is haunting the landfills of Accra like a ghost from the fashion past. It’s a mountain of shame to be honest.\nBut fear not, eco-warriors, for there might be a glimmer of hope in the fashion abyss. Brands like Ganni are cooking up a storm with bags made from bacteria, while others are turning agricultural waste – think wine leftovers, tomatoes, pineapples, and mushrooms – into avant-garde fashion statements. Yet, the road to redemption is rocky. Coatings, especially those pesky ones made from polyurethane (PU), are fashion's guilty pleasure, and they're not recyclable.\nEnter the heroes of the story – carob-inspired leather by Dio Kurazawa, Mirum by Camper, and Deadwood Studios, making cactus cool again. These innovators are flipping the script, giving Mother Earth a standing ovation.\nBut, alas, change takes time. Designer Alice V Robinson is on a quest for ethical real leather, crafting collections from a single animal and chronicling the odyssey in her book, \"Field Fork Fashion.\" It's not just about launching a new material; it's about overthrowing an entire system. Leather must rise from the ashes, no longer perceived as a dime-store commodity.\nIn the end, as we always say at LUC8K, it's about transparency. Know what you're adorning your body with, and be mindful of what happens when the thrill of the faux leather fades. We need to prioritize quality over quantity, choose timeless pieces that last, and rally behind brands committed to saving our beloved planet.\nAt LUC8K, we are proud to use real leather from sustainable sources. Our cows are happy cows, we make sure they live a long and free life, eating grass in the lush fields in France until the time comes for them to be used in the meat industry. We use the by-product and we don’t waste a single thing. Our bags and accessories are truly bespoke, we only ever handmake our products to order, so there’s absolutely no waste. And you know what? Our bags get better with age, so they last a lifetime. They won’t end up in a mountain of faux leather waste anytime soon.\nCertainly not in our lifetime.\nSo, dear fashionistas, let's not just follow the trends – let's set them ablaze with a sustainable spark. The global south shouldn't bear the brunt of our fashion excesses. It's time to dress not just for the occasion but for a brighter, greener future.\nPersonalised style and sustainable luxury is who we are and what we stand for.

{"id": "2129", "text": "Chinese livestreamers have set their sights on TikTok shoppers in the U.S. and Europe, hawking everything from bags and apparel to crystals with their eyes on a potentially lucrative market, despite uncertainties over the platform’s future in the U.S. and elsewhere.\nIn China, where livestreaming ecommerce is forecast to reach 4.9 trillion yuan ($676 billion) by the year’s end, popular hosts like “Lipstick King” Austin Li rack up tens of millions of dollars in sales during a single livestream. Many brands, including L’Oreal, Nike and Louis Vuitton, have begun using livestreaming to reach more shoppers.\nBut the highly competitive livestreaming market in China has led some hosts to look to Western markets to carve out niches for themselves.\nOreo Deng, a former English tutor, sells jewelry to U.S. customers by livestreaming on TikTok, delivering her sales pitches in English for about four to six hours a day.\n“I wanted to try livestreaming on TikTok because it aligned with my experiences as an English tutor and my past jobs working in cross-border e-commerce,” Deng said.\nSince 2019, western e-commerce platforms like Amazon and Facebook have experimented with livestreaming e-commerce after seeing the success of Chinese platforms like Alibaba’s Tmall and Taobao, and Douyin, TikTok’s Chinese counterpart in China.\nTikTok started testing its live shopping feature last year. Registered merchants from the U.S., Indonesia, Vietnam and Singapore, among other countries, can now sell via livestreams online.\nBut livestreaming e-commerce has yet to take off in the U.S. The livestreaming e-commerce market in the U.S. — the world’s biggest consumer market — is expected to grow to $68 billion by 2026, according to research and advisory firm Coresight Research.\nThe relatively lukewarm reception led Facebook to shut down its live shopping feature last year. As for TikTok, the platform has the added risk of potentially facing U.S. restrictions due to tensions between Beijing and Washington.\nTikTok, whose parent company is Chinese technology firm ByteDance, has been criticized for its Chinese ties and accused of being a national security risk due to the data it collects.\nTikTok did not provide comment for this story.\nDespite the scrutiny faced by TikTok, many Chinese hosts view the U.S. as a vast ocean of opportunity, an emerging market that has yet to be saturated with livestreaming hosts.\n“There’s more opportunity for growth to target America because the competition is so fierce in China,” said Shaun Rein, founder and managing director of China Market Research Group in Shanghai. “Livestreaming in the U.S. is at a beginning starting point. There’s more opportunity to grab market share.”\nRein also said that Chinese merchants can often price items higher in the U.S., where customers are accustomed to paying higher prices compared to in China, where product margins are often razor-thin.\n“The format is going to work, because it’s been proven,” said Jacob Cooke, CEO of e-commerce consultancy WPIC.\nSmaller companies, including those in China that are attempting to sell on TikTok, might lack enough data on what customers want in markets like the U.S, he said. “Once they do get that figured out, they’ll start to have very good success,” Cooke said.\nFor some U.S. shoppers, the livestream format is a fascinating form of entertainment.\nFreisa Weaver, a 36-year-old who lives in Florida, stumbled on a TikTok livestream selling crystals 10 months ago. It employed a popular tactic called a “lucky scoop” where buyers pay a set price to receive several random items scooped from a large container of crystals. TikTok earlier this year banned this practice from livestreams to comply with gambling laws, although some sellers still offer grab bags of goodies which appear to be scooped off-camera.\n“I came across it scrolling through TikTok and at first I was entertained by the lucky scoops,” Weaver said, describing livestreaming shopping as an addictive hobby. “Now I’m a regular buyer in some of the live feeds on TikTok.”\n“I personally enjoy the interactions with the host and the possibility of finding something special and unique just for me,” she said\nHer favorite channel is Meow Crystals, an account operated by Chinese streaming hosts that often does flash sales selling crystals for as little as $2, and grab bags of crystals from $10. TikTok has yet to roll out its in-built shopping feature on a wide scale, so many streamers, including those from Meow Crystals, often redirect viewers to place orders on an external website.\n“The host is willing to go to the warehouse for you and get special items, or they remember what you like and offer it to you as soon as you are online,” Weaver said.\nChinese livestreaming hosts try various tactics to stand out and build a loyal customer base. For some, it’s personalized customer service, while others use quirky catchphrases and concoct flamboyant online personalities to keep their customers entertained.\n“Every host is always experimenting and develops their own tactics,” Deng, the livestream host said, declining to share the secrets of her own approach.\nBoot camps to teach Chinese livestreamers how to increase their sales have sprung up, including a popular one hosted by Yan Guanghua, one of TikTok earliest livestreamers in China.\nLike Deng, Yan is a former English tutor who turned to TikTok livestreaming after a government crackdown on the private education industry.\nYan started out hawking yoga clothes, electronics and apparel online. Finding she had a knack for selling to customers via livestreaming, she at times has racked up sales of 5,000 pounds ($6,510) per stream selling to customers in Britain.\nNow she charges about $1,000 for two-day boot camps she holds two or three times a month, teaching people how to sell more on livestreams.\nYan says she has trained more than 600 people, mostly from China but also from the U.S. and Africa.\nLike many other TikTok livestreaming hosts, she hopes the overseas livestreaming e-commerce market will take off like it has in China.\n“It’s hard to say what the future of this industry is. It’s difficult to predict,” Yan said. “But what we know is that TikTok is the most popular platform right now and there is still opportunity here.”", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}

It was seen as the spiritual successor of Afrikaana in that the vast majority of its players originated from this nation's team, but it did not retain its records.\nThe North Antarctic Domain applied successfully to join the FMF after the territory was founded by Passio-Corum in early 2015. In their first qualifiers, the team finished third in their five-team group with 13 points.\nIn early 2018, the North Antarctic Domain became an autonomous territory of the Imperial Trade Union, after Passio-Corum joined with the Strait of Haifa, and maintained its separate FMF membership.

{"id": "2148", "text": "Color, 1993, 98 mins. 8 secs.\nDirected by John Dahl\nStarring Nicolas Cage, Dennis Hopper, Lara Flynn Boyle, J.T. Walsh\nCinématographe (Blu-ray) (US RA HD), Umbrella Entertainment (Blu-ray & DVD) (Australia RB/R2 HD/PAL), Plan B Entertainemnt (Blu-ray) (UK RB HD) / WS (1.85:1) (16:9), Concorde (Blu-ray & DVD) (Germany RB/R2 HD/PAL) / WS (1.78:1) (16:9),\nAfter the neon-soaked wave of '80s neo-noir, the '90s shifted gears with a more gritty, classical approach that provided a showcase for several notable directors -- and few shone brighter than John Dahl, arguably the maestro of '90s noir. He also had an outrageous unlucky streak when it came to distributing his films, particularly the first three that really put him on the map: Kill Me Again, Red Rock West, and The Last Seduction, with the latter two hitting cable TV before they ended up finding acclaim via theatrical runs. The case of Red Rock West proved particularly strange since its high-caliber cast including Nicolas Cage, Dennis Hopper, and Lara Flynn Boyle (all veterans of acclaimed David Lynch projects with Wild at Heart, Blue Velvet, and Twin Peaks respectively) didn't counteract the film's tepid treatment from distributor PolyGram (picking it up from music video-based outfit Propaganda Films). In a strange twist, a Canadian festival screening so impressed San Francisco exhibitor Bill Banning that he arranged to have the film exhibited in major cities through his own Roxie Releasing. The gambit worked, with the film's snappy script, whiplash plot twists, and gorgeous visual style impressing critics and art house audiences enough to solidify Dahl's name as one to watch. Dahl would continue to weave noir elements into his later studio films like Joy Ride, Rounders, and Unforgettable, but Red Red West remains a peak distillation of his ability along with co-writer brother Rick Dahl to weave classic crime film elements into a fresh, unpredictable viewing experience.\nTraveling through Wyoming, scrupulously honest drifter and veteran MIchael Williams (Cage) is unable to secure a manual labor job due to a leg injury. With only a few dollars left in his pocket, he ends up at a bar in the town of Red Rock where his Texas license plate and a chance encounter at a bar lead Wayne (Walsh) to mistake him for a hit man coming from Dallas. With the offer of a job on the table to kill Wayne's wife, Suzanne (Boyle), Michael has to think fast if he wants to get some more cash without having to take any lives in the process. When he approaches Suzanne, she makes a counter offer that becomes even more complicated when the real murderer for hire, Lyle (Hopper), shows up belatedly with an agenda of his own.\nTo say any more about the story, especially the details involving our married couple, would spoil much of the fun of watching this film as it bounces Michael back and forth across town and over rooftops with an almost existential inability to get out of Red Rock no matter how hard he tries. There's a great deal of humor here as well with Cage and Hopper sharing some delicious banter in a few scenes, and it's a real treat trying to keep up with all the wry reversals waiting in this mousetrap of a plot.\nFollowing its theatrical run and its USA Network airing, Red Rock West appeared on VHS in several territories including a widely available release from Columbia TriStar that did its best to seal with a tricky aesthetic filed with saturated colors and dark shadows. For some reason it became stubbornly difficult to see in the U.S. for a long time after that, and in the past decade, the first really reasonable release was separate Blu-ray and DVD editions in Germany from Concorde in 2016. (That version also featured a really amusing German dub in addition to the original English track, which is something to experience.) In 2023, Australia's Umbrella Entertainment released a standard and a deluxe edition on Blu-ray featuring an archival commentary by both Dahls and editor Scott Chestnut, a new commentary by this writer that obviously can't be evaluated, the trailer, a 17m20s Dahl trailer reel covering everything from Kill Me Again to You Kill Me, a 9m18s video essay by Petros Patsilivas focusing on the film as a signpost of sorts in Cage's career, a 13m22s \"The Man from Rhode Island\" study of Walsh's life and career, a 21m49s interview with editor Scott Chestnut, and a 30m11s interview with John Dahl. The transfer on this release appears to originate from the same scan used for the German release, though it improves via deeper black levels and more accurate 1.85:1 framing versus the readjusted 1.781: on the earlier disc. That release was soon followed by a U.K. Blu-ray from Signal One sublabel Plan B Entertainment, featuring a still gallery, the original commentary track, the Patsilivas video essay, a booklet with an essay by Ian Schultz, and interviews with John Dahl, Chestnut, and actor Dale Gibson.\nAfter decades in the wilderness, Red Rock West finally returned to the U.S. as a Blu-ray release from new Vinegar Syndrome sublabel Cinématographe. The new 4K restoration from the 35mm interpositive also retains the correct 1.85:1 framing and improves in several respects, most obviously in detail and film grain resolution and especially contrast with the blown-out bright areas now looking far more controlled and legible. (See below for a couple of obvious examples.) The DTS-HD MA 2.0 English stereo track sounds excellent and faithful to the original Dolby Stereo mix, with optional English SDH subtitles provided. A new audio commentary by Alain Silver and filmmaker Christopher Coppola (Cage's brother) compares this film to Coppola's noir-inspired Deadfall made the same year with Cage and goes into the history of Propaganda before analyzing the various noir tropes of this and other '90s films like After Dark My Sweet, along with a quirky running joke about the significance (or lack thereof) of all the actors' blue eyes. The Scot Chestnut and Petros Patsilivas featurettes are ported over from the Umbrella release, while a new interview with John Dahl, \"A Thousand Miles from Nowhere\" (26m33s), covers his exposure to noir while studying at the AFI, the inspiration for the film's mistaken identity story, his own background that informed the setting, and the process of casting the film on a minimal budget and dealing with more than a few production challenges. Then in \"Neon and Dust\" (17m17s), Rick Dahl talks about his family's Montana background, his own fondness for spaghetti westerns, and the tag team nature of writing the script.

{"id": "2200", "text": "There appears to be no end in sight to the mythification of Bloomsbury. As a phenomenon of late twentieth-century Anglo-American cultural life, Bloomsbury has long ceased to be the coterie interest it once was. It has expanded its domain to become one of the mainstream myths of the modern era. In the universities, the study of Bloomsbury is a flourishing industry. On the literary scene, its participants are the subject of an immense biographical and critical literature. Even more improbably, the sex life of Bloomsbury has found its way into the manufacture of romantic idylls for the stage and screen. (Who, even a few years ago, would have dreamed that a character as unappetizing as Lytton Strachey could be turned into a romantic figure for the movies?) If there is not yet a Bloomsbury coloring book, there is already a Virginia Woolf calendar and a Virginia Woolf T-shirt. It hardly matters, moreover, that Bloomsbury produced, besides Virginia Woolf, only two other important talents: John Maynard Keynes and Roger Fry. It is in the nature of the mythification process that minor talents—and even people of no discernible talent at all—are elevated to a status that far exceeds their intrinsic interest. Whatever they may have lacked as writers, artists, or thinkers, these minor characters are assumed to command some enduring appeal simply on the basis of the roles they played in the lives of Bloomsbury eminences.\nAs the Bloomsbury juggernaut approaches a new millennium, moreover, we are sure to see further wonders offered in its name. The mythification process certainly shows no sign of abatement. Yet the meaning of the myth is bound to undergo some significant modifications as it accommodates itself to new cultural conditions.\nNow, just a little in advance of the new millennium, comes a glimpse of what the “new” Bloomsbury is probably going to look like.\nNow, just a little in advance of the new millennium, comes a glimpse of what the “new” Bloomsbury is probably going to look like. If the views of Christopher Reed, the editor of A Roger Fry Reader,1 are to be taken as an augury—and there is ample reason to suppose that they are—then the new Bloomsbury, a Bloomsbury more suitable to the early decades of the twenty-first century, will be a “postmodern” Bloomsbury. This is bad luck for an old Bloomsbury hand like Peter Stansky, whose new study of the subject, On or About December 1910: Early Bloomsbury and Its Intimate World, has also just been published and has already been rendered redundant by Mr. Reed’s revisionism. Mr. Stansky, the Frances and Charles Field Professor of History at Stanford University, takes what may now be said to be the old view: that the history of Bloomsbury belongs to the history of modernism. From Mr. Reed’s revisionist perspective, this old view will no longer do. “I am concerned,” he writes in his Introduction to A Roger Fry Reader, “to describe Fry’s activism in its historical context, with reference to the concerns and interests associated with postmodernism.”\nAre we now, then, to regard Fry himself as a postmodernist? Well, sort of. Mr. Reed labors mightily to create the impression that inside the modernist Roger Fry there was all along a postmodernist provocateur struggling to make himself heard. In this regard, certainly, Mr. Reed shows himself to be a dab hand at postmodernist bodysnatching. It isn’t until the concluding pages of this volume, by which time—owing to his extensive commentaries and notes—it has become almost as much a Christopher Reed Reader as A Roger Fry Reader, and after much belaboring of the “historical context,” that Mr. Reed can bring himself to acknowledge that “Fry is not, of course, a postmodernist.” Yet even this pro forma admission is quickly followed by the inevitable disclaimer. “Nevertheless,” Mr. Reed reminds us, “today’s readers may find, in Fry’s consistent foregrounding in his personal subjectivity, in his antagonism toward authority, and, finally, in his doubt, a figure far more sympathetic than we have been led to expect.” In short, a postmodernist avant la lettre. As if modernism has remained untouched by such phenomena as “personal subjectivism”—what other kind is there, by the way?—or “antagonism toward authority” or even “doubt.” For an exponent of “historical context,” Mr. Reed proves to be a remarkably unreliable guide to history— especially the history of modernism, which is the subject he has undertaken to deconstruct in this book.\nAnyone familiar with the strategies of postmodernist discourse will readily recognize, of course, that it is now standard procedure for its practitioners to invoke the claims of “historical context” for what actually amounts to a project of historical nullification. The only wonder in this case is that Mr. Reed should have chosen Roger Fry, of all unlikely candidates, for a project of this kind. Attempting to annex Fry—the greatest modernist critic of his day—to the bandwagon of postmodernism is, after all, a little like trying to assign Cézanne to the ranks of his pompier adversaries. It can be done, I suppose, but what except errant ideological nonsense has been accomplished in the process? The work itself will simply not support such an ill-conceived endeavor.\nIt can be done, I suppose, but what except errant ideological nonsense has been accomplished in the process?\nIt is significant, in this respect, that in the passage I have already cited from Mr. Reed’s Introduction to A Roger Fry Reader he should speak of the critic’s “activism” rather than of his art criticism. Activism, which is to say social activism, is an enterprise dear to the hearts of every true postmodernist, whereas criticism—especially the kind of formalist criticism that Fry practiced in the heyday of his fame and influence—is regarded as mere grist for the postmodernist’s deconstructionist mill. It is very much to Mr. Reed’s purpose in assembling and annotating A Roger Fry Reader for a new generation of readers—readers unlikely to be familiar with Fry’s writings on art—to give priority to what he describes as Fry’s “sense of social purpose” while at the same time discounting the criticism that established Fry as the leading champion of modernism in the English-speaking world of his generation. Thus, from the two collections of Fry’s critical essays that have long been regarded as classic contributions to the literature of modernism—Vision and Design (1920) and Transformations (1926)—Mr. Reed has chosen exactly nothing for this new Reader. This is in itself an act of historical nullification that leaves the newcomer to Fry’s criticism unequipped to judge either the quality of his performance as a modernist critic or, indeed, the character of the distortions which Mr. Reed has been obliged to impose on Fry’s critical oeuvre in the interest of claiming him as some sort of proto-postmodernist.\nIt is worth recalling, in this connection, that in the “Retrospect” which Fry appended to the essays he collected in Vision and Design, he famously defined his critical credo. “I conceived the form of a work of art to be its most essential quality,” he wrote, adding in the same essay that “I conceived the form and the emotion which it conveyed as being inextricably bound together in the aesthetic whole.” What he elsewhere in Vision and Design described as “the aesthetic vision, the vision with which we contemplate works of art,” remained for Fry his fundamental critical priority. It was the sensibility and intellectual tenacity with which he applied his own “aesthetic vision” to the contemplation of works of art—and not only works of modernist art, of course —that gave his criticism its immense persuasive force and made Fry himself a crucial figure in the history of English modernism even for the many artists, art historians, cultural bureaucrats, and amateurs of the arts who dissented from his judgments and opposed his principles.\nIt is also important to recall that Fry did not come to modernism as an avant-garde incendiary. Far from it. He came to modernism after a protracted immersion in the art of the Italian Renaissance masters. It was in that field of connoisseurship, where he labored first as a disciple and then as a rival of Bernard Berenson, that Fry made his debut as a recognized authority on the art of painting. When he took up the cause of modernist painting in the first decade of the twentieth century, giving priority to the work of Cézanne and Matisse, he thus brought to it a keen sense of the pictorial traditions in terms of which the modernist painters he favored needed to be seen to be fully understood. He did not regard modernism, as so many doctrinaire avant-gardists did, as a break with tradition. Fry’s understanding of the relation of the modernist painters to the traditions that preceded and nurtured them is now something we take for granted, of course, but it was a highly controversial idea at the time. Moreover, it remained a fundamental donnée of Fry’s criticism to the end. In 1930, twenty years after he organized the first “Post-Impressionism” exhibition in London, Fry devoted a monograph to Matisse which was similarly based on what he called “this long approach” to a modernist painter by way of traditions traced back to Byzantine art and the paintings of Caravaggio. It is one of the virtues of A Roger Fry Reader, by the way, that it reprints the text of the Henri Matisse monograph in its entirety. It is one of the failings of this volume, however, that it includes none of Fry’s writings on Italian painting—another omission that effectively eliminates one of the foundations of his critical thought.\nIn this respect, as in others, A Roger Fry Reader is a book very much at odds with itself, for it seems to have been designed to serve as both an indictment and a defense of its subject. What is under indictment— much of the time, anyway—is not so much Fry’s modernism as the bogeyman of “formalism,” with which modernism is routinely identified when it suits Mr. Reed’s critical agenda. It is thus one of the aims of the Reader to rescue Fry from his reputation as a formalist critic—“the ponderous ‘Father of Formalism,’” as Mr. Reed puts it, who would now have to be considered “the figurehead of a discredited age”—in order to recast him as a cultural emancipator on the social barricades.\nAt times, then, this obliges Mr. Reed to separate the “good” Fry—the kind of modernist who, as an “activist” battling for cultural reform, can somehow be construed to have been a precursor of the postmodernist assault on a privileged aesthetic—from the “bad” Fry, who is seen to have succumbed to a weakness for the sort of formalist criticism that gives priority to (what else?) a privileged “aesthetic vision.” If all this sounds like something of a muddle—well, I am afraid this Reader very often does collapse into a muddle from which the real Roger Fry is absent for pages at a time.\nThe muddle is somewhat clarified, to be sure, if close attention is paid not only to the ninety or so pages of tendentious commentaries which Mr. Reed has contributed to the Reader but also to the seventeen pages of notes that are appended to the commentaries. In a good many of those pages we are a long way from the Bloomsbury we once knew—we are, indeed, catapulted into the college classrooms of the 1990s where Mr. Reed is offering us a refresher course in the kind of cultural politics that now occupy a place of unchallenged privilege in American academic life.\nIn this postmodernist wonderland, we once again encounter Benjamin Buchloh instructing us in the evils of “advanced capitalism”—in which evils, not surprisingly, “the prisonhouse of modernism” is said to be complicit. Here, too, postmodernist doctoral dissertations on the politics of Bloomsbury are solemnly cited to support the notion that “Fry’s texts [on African sculpture] contribute to the twentieth-century project of conceiving a postcolonial world.” Then, of course, there is the expected assault on the art criticism of Clement Greenberg, without which no postmodernist discussion of bogeyman formalism would nowadays be compete. And for newcomers to the subject, there are convenient references to the political literature that attempts to reduce not only Clement Greenberg’s criticism but the entire post-World War II New York School to the status of a Cold War foreign-policy strategy. To bring us fully up to date, moreover, Mr. Reed refers us to his own recent contribution to postmodernist studies—an essay called “Making History: The Bloomsbury Group’s Construction of Aesthetic and Sexual Identity,” published in a volume called Gay and Lesbian Studies in Art History, edited by Whitney Davis and published by the Haworth Press in 1994. Some of the claims that Mr. Reed makes for the influence of Whistler and Wilde on Fry in the Reader are spelled out in more explicit political detail in this essay on “Aesthetic and Sexual Identity.”\nGiven this deeply prejudicial approach to Fry’s art criticism, it is a considerable mercy that there is as much good reading in the Reader as there is\nGiven this deeply prejudicial approach to Fry’s art criticism, it is a considerable mercy that there is as much good reading in the Reader as there is. While the book is very far from bringing together the best of Fry’s writings on art—for that kind of Reader, the inclusion of certain essays from Vision and Design and Transformations would be essential—Mr. Reed is nonetheless to be commended for making available some fine examples of Fry’s criticism that are otherwise not easily available. I have already mentioned the excellent essay on Matisse. “Picasso” (1921) is interesting now for the glimpse it gives us of Fry’s doubts about the capacity of pure abstraction, with its tendency to eliminate the illusion of spatial depth, to produce as rich a pictorial experience as painting that remains tethered to the depiction of a third dimension.\nSpeaking in this essay of the younger Cubists who were influenced by Picasso, Fry acknowledges that while “there is nothing inherently impossible in the venture to create expressive form out of the minimum of representation possible,” he does not find the pictorial result entirely satisfactory. “For some reason,” he writes, “the effect on the mind of flat forms is feeble in comparison with the effect of forms that either present or represent relief in three dimensions.” Picasso himself, Fry points out, “is keenly aware of this, and nothing in his work is more remarkable than the extraordinary invention he displays in the discovery of new qualities of pigment calculated to suggest the relief of one surface upon another.” Yet his doubts persist. “The immense resource of suggesting real distance and, perhaps even more important, the circumambience of space,” he writes, “seems to be almost cut off, or at most reduced, in its power to persuade the imagination.”\nLest we are tempted to dismiss such doubts as a period failure of taste, it is worth remembering that Frank Stella’s Working Space, published in 1986, is largely devoted to the same aesthetic doubts. Never mind the problems raised by the art that Stella produced in response to the pictorial issues discussed in Working Space. The issues are essentially the same as those raised by Fry in 1921 about the pictorial implications of Cubism—issues (need one add?) that have remained central to formalist criticism down to the present day, and thus an integral component of the internal debate that modernist painting has conducted with itself. It is also interesting to note, in this connection, that in 1913, ten years before the “Picasso” essay, Fry showed distinctly less hesitation in embracing the early abstract painting of Kandinsky, describing two of the artist’s Improvisations as “pure visual music” and declaring that “I cannot any longer doubt the possibility of emotional expression by such abstract visual signs.” The pictorial space in these Improvisations retains, however, what Fry called “the immense resource of suggesting real distance.” Kandinsky’s subsequent elimination of the “resource” from his abstract painting seems not to have elicited any response from Fry, but I think it is accurate to say that he never fully embraced the principles of pure abstraction. He much preferred the kind of “abstraction” that remained attached, however distantly, to some element of representation, and in that respect Fry was very much a partisan of the modernist aesthetic that governed the School of Paris in its heyday in the first quarter of the century.\nThe pictorial space in these Improvisations retains, however, what Fry called “the immense resource of suggesting real distance.”\nIt is that allegiance that we have to keep in mind in accounting for some of Fry’s critical prejudices even in regard to French painting—his disparagement of Monet, for example. For the Paris avant-garde in the early decades of the century, Cézanne was a god and Monet was considered passé. Hence Fry’s dismissal of Monet—in a letter that Mr. Reed has included in the Reader— as an artist far too dependent upon “the casual dictation of natural appearance.” It’s a pity that Mr. Reed did not include the discussion devoted to Monet in Fry’s Characteristics of French Art (1932), for it is a classic example of the way a great painter—in this case, Monet—is bound to be misjudged when approached from the perspective of another great painter—Cézanne—who devised quite opposing principles for his art. It is also an example of how much we can still learn about Monet from Fry, despite his adverse judgment of the artist.\nThe art of painting does not, alas, appear to be a compelling interest for Mr. Reed. One of the essays I miss the most in this Reader is the one that Fry devoted to Albert Pinkham Ryder in the Burlington Magazine in April 1908. As far as I know, it has never been reprinted anywhere. Fry became acquainted with Ryder’s paintings during his tenure as the curator of the Metropolitan Museum in New York in the first decade of the century. His essay is one of the finest things ever written about Ryder, yet it remains largely unknown. Frances Spalding, in her 1980 biography of Fry, Roger Fry: Art and Life, made the mistake of flatly asserting that the critic took no interest whatever in American painting during his tenure at the Met, and it may be that Mr. Reed was misled by this error. But then, the essays on painting omitted from this Reader that one would need to know to understand Fry’s importance as an art critic would easily fill a volume as large as Mr. Reed’s.\nMr. Reed much prefers Fry in his role as an “activist”—which is to say, a propagandist laboring to reform the taste of the obdurate philistines of his day. Through the magic of the postmodernist prism, even a benign little essay on “Wedgewood China,” from 1905, can be made to assume the trappings of a social manifesto, especially when linked—as Mr. Reed hastens to do—with the political influence of William Morris and Oscar Wilde. In this regard, much is made of Fry’s role in establishing the Omega Workshops, an ill-fated endeavor that attempted to recast the aspirations of the Arts and Crafts movement according to decorative principles based on the Fauvism of Matisse and the Cubism of Picasso. In the history of modernist design, the Omega Workshops project is little more than a footnote, but in this Reader it is made to sound as if it had been an achievement on the scale of the Bauhaus—though any comparison with the Bauhaus itself is wisely avoided. Instead, Fry’s fragmentary reflections on modern architecture are favorably compared to Le Corbusier’s Vers une architecture. But it is nonsense to claim, as Mr. Reed does, that what he calls “Fry’s architectural principles” should now be seen to occupy “a central place in the history of modernism.” Fry said some very intelligent things about architecture, but his achievements in that field can hardly be said to extend beyond the house he designed for himself. Le Corbusier he was not.\nWhat A Roger Fry Reader will remain valuable for are some of the essays that Mr. Reed has culled from the voluminous body of criticism that Fry contributed to journals and books that have not before been collected. Besides the Matisse and Picasso essays already mentioned, the outstanding examples are the Introduction to his translations of Mallarmé, the essay on “M. Larionow and the Russian Ballet,” a hilarious polemic on “The Case of the Late Sir Lawrence Alma Tadema, O.M.,” and “Blake and British Art.” There are also a good many sharp observations buried in pieces that are otherwise no longer compelling. Too often, however, the “good” Roger Fry—Mr. Reed’s nominee for posthumous postmodernist honors—turns out to be the promoter of good causes that were largely won before anyone thought of calling them “postmodernist.” The “bad” Fry is the modernist critic—and the formalist critic of modernist art—whose work endures. It is a political sham, a postmodernist sham, to pretend otherwise.\nThere is a paragraph in Peter Stansky’s On or About December 1910 that states the traditional view of Roger Fry very clearly:\nFry was full of energy and imagination, and through his lectures, his pen, his gift for friendship, his gift for advocacy, he was able to preach a new doctrine, to become a magnet for younger painters, to bring the interests of the English into the international arena. He was also particularly important not only for making these French painters so much better known in the Anglo-American world but for enunciating ideas about them that made it clearer than had been true before what these pictures meant—at least according to him—that made them more self-consciously part of the movement of modernism. He helped liberate painting from the tyranny of representation and gave it a power that he felt had not been seen in European painting since the Italian primitives.\nThis isn’t all there needs to be said about Fry, to be sure, but it is a better place to start from than all of Christopher Reed’s tortuous postmodernist claptrap. Unfortunately, however, much of On or About December 1910 is itself based on something very akin to claptrap—the observation famously made by Virginia Woolf in 1924 that “on or about December 1910 human character changed.” The reference was to the first Post-Impressionist exhibition that Fry organized in London that year. That exhibition did indeed contribute something important to the modification of British taste in art, but you have only to examine the denizens of Bloomsbury itself to see how little the show changed their character, never mind that of the entire modern world. Newcomers to the Bloomsbury literature will find a useful introduction to the period in Mr. Stansky’s book, and readers already familiar with the Bloomsbury myth will find in Mr. Stansky one of its more devoted acolytes. For myself, it is the kind of book that so piously exaggerates the importance of Bloomsbury that it makes one yearn for some countervailing demystification of the entire movement. Unfortunately, Mr. Reed’s postmodernist “cure” is far worse than the “disease” it purports to remedy—but I would be very surprised if his postmodernist travesty does not turn out to be a preview of the Bloomsbury that awaits us in the coming century.\n- On or About December 1910: Early Bloomsbury and Its Intimate World, by Peter Stansky; Harvard University Press, 289 pages, $27.95.

Traffic was backed up in all directions as first responders worked at the scene of what appeared to be a two vehicle collision at the intersection of County Road 43 and South Gower Drive.\nThe crash occurred at approximately 9:30 am, with two badly damaged vehicles ending up in the ditch at the southwest corner of the intersection. From the observable damage, it appears that the red car may have struck the side of the black car, but this is purely speculation. Police, fire and ambulance vehicles were all on scene, with one lane of County Road 43 blocked by a firetruck, and one lane of South Gower Drive blocked by an ambulance. As a result of the lane reductions, police were controlling traffic, directing only one direction to move at a time in short intervals.\nThe intersection at South Gower Drive is known for the high frequency of accidents that occur there, including accidents that occasionally result in fatalities. Visibility is generally good at the intersection, but the volume of traffic on both roads likely contributes to the high number of collisions. Since the traffic on County Road 43 does not stop at the intersection, drivers are likely inclined to take risks and cut other drivers off during periods of the day during which there is near continuous traffic on the highway. Drivers on County Road 43 are warned of the approaching intersection with a “proceed with caution” sign and a flashing yellow light. The broken centre line has also been replaced with a double solid line on the stretch of highway that runs through the intersection to discourage passing. For drivers on South Gower Drive, a flashing red light and a sign reading “cross traffic does not stop” warns drivers of the intersection’s danger.\nSeveral years ago, it was announced that the intersection in question is expected to be fitted with a roundabout to counteract the increasing problem of collisions at the location. In fact, this decision was made in 2019, with a moving deadline for the completion of the work which was predicted late last year to be completed some time in 2022. With the final few months of the year looming, and no signs of construction yet at the intersection, questions still remain about timelines for the project.\nIn the meantime, drivers would do well to have patience, even at the most frustrating of intersections. Turning onto a busy County Road in unrelenting traffic can be frustrating, which can lead to impulsive decisions in even the most patient and reasonable of individuals, but the goal of being on time should not come with a sacrifice of personal safety or the safety of others. Sitting at an intersection waiting to proceed can feel like an eternity, but in reality, it likely takes one or two minutes on average for a safe opening in traffic to emerge.

{"id": "2230", "text": "Greetings Cannabis Law Reform Community,\nIt’s time to think about what we aim to achieve in 2013. Outside of Canada, it seems as though cannabis law reform is happening everywhere, yet within our borders cannabis law reform still eludes us.\nUnder its current government, Canada has not embraced the global trend towards cannabis law reform. We should not let this fact discourage our reform efforts. Rather, Canada’s failure to be an international leader in cannabis law reform should be our rallying call.\nIt is time for each of us to do our part to end cannabis prohibition. This month’s issue is about what you can do to help.\n- 420 Everywhere: showing support for change from coast-to-cost\n- Fill the Hill 2013: democratizing cannabis policy in Canada\n- A NORML Approach: guidelines for legalization in Canada\n- R v Mernagh: when the law backs you into a corner\n420 Everywhere: showing support for change from coast-to-cost\nAfter a long, cold winter, Canadians have a lot to be excited about. To many, one of the highlights of spring is taking part in one of Canada’s national 420 rallies.\nOn April 20th, cannabis reformers around the world will step into the public spotlight to demonstrate their support for change. From small rural gatherings, to large urban rallies, these events use civil disobedience to advocate reforming cannabis laws.\nEach year, thousands of Canadians congregate locally to demonstrate their commitment to cannabis law reform. These events range in size from thousands of supporters, to just a handful. Regardless of size, each event sends the message: it’s time to end cannabis prohibition.\nErb 4 Herb\nThe cannabis law reform community got very lucky this year. Robert Erb, a long-time activist and resident of Terrance BC, won the lottery. Continuing his history of activism and philanthropy, Mr. Erb has pledged to use his winnings to fund the legalization of cannabis in Canada.\nMr. Erb started by supporting the various 420 rallies, which occur annually in Canada. The website, www.420rally.ca, was created as a place where activists and organizers can go to register their 420 event.\nAdditionally, each province has been given funding to help expand on, and improve, existing 420 rallies. The goal was to not only increase attendance, but also try and improve the media coverage received by each event. Mr. Erb hopes his contributions will help the 420 rallies have a greater impact on cannabis law reform.\nAs a result of Mr. Erb’s contributions, this year’s 420 rallies will be something to remember. Many established 420 rallies expect record-breaking attendance, while many other cities will be able to grow fledgling events.\nNORML Canada’s Participation\nThis year, NORML Canada will be represented at many 420 rallies. Look for NORML Canada representatives, literature and banners at your local event. If you would like NORML Canada to help support your local 420 rally, email email@example.com and let us know.\nWe look forward to meeting new, and existing members of NORML Canada this 420.\nIt is important everyone with a stake in cannabis law reform support their local 420 rally to demonstrate Canada is ready for change.\nA list of cities holding a 420 rally can be found here.\nFill the Hill 2013: democratizing cannabis policy in Canada\nIn many ways, the political treatment of cannabis policy is illustrative of the rift between Canadian citizens and their government. Mr. Erb described cannabis prohibition as the biggest social injustice of his lifetime. For decades, a growing majority of Canadians have supported reforming cannabis laws. However, in 2012, the Government increased the criminalization of cannabis users, sellers and producers. This demonstrates our democratic process is broken when it comes to cannabis policy.\nDemocratizing Cannabis Policy\nThe organizers of Fill the Hill 2013 are looking to “democratize cannabis policy”. Organizers point out a majority of Canadians support reforming cannabis laws, yet our democratically elected government has reinforced the prohibition of cannabis. They hope their event will achieve two goals: demonstrate to Canadians that cannabis law reform is best achieved at the ballot box, and demonstrate to Canadian politicians there is political capital to be gained by supporting reform. To demonstrate the political nature of cannabis policy, Fill the Hill will give attendees a chance to vote on the future of cannabis policy in Canada. Representatives of the Liberal Party of Canada, the Canadian NDP and the Green Party of Canada will present their party’s position on cannabis law reform. Then attendees will be able to vote for their favourite party using a cell phone. While the vote obviously will not be binding on the government, organizers hope it will demonstrate cannabis is a viable political issue, one which politicians ought to pay attention to.\nFrom Activism to Lobbying\nOne of the lessons learned from the successful reforms in Colorado and Washington State is the power of lobbying. While Canada is endowed with many prominent activists, until recently, few have focused on directly lobbying the Federal Government to change its cannabis policies. Fill the Hill will feature two cannabis lobbyists. Joshua Kapppel, who helped write and pass Amendment 64 in Colorado and Andrea Matrosovs of the NORML Woman’s Alliance of Canada, will explain what individuals can do to help make change.\nA Final Push\nNORML Canada recognizes the importance of ensuring cannabis policy reform becomes a central issue in the next electoral cycle. It is up to our community to ensure politicians are made to take a position on cannabis policy. It is encouraging to see increasing support for legalizing and regulating cannabis at the federal level from potential Liberal leadership candidates, as well as MP Elizabeth May’s Green Party of Canada. However, this is only the first step towards legalization – far from ensuring law reform will occur. It is up to each of us to do our part to bring about cannabis law reform.\nA Vision of the Future: NORML Canada’s Cannabis Reform Proposal\nThere was a time when cannabis policy debate was binary: some groups sought to “legalize”, while others alleged society would crumble without the criminal prohibition against cannabis. Over four decades of debate, the discourse regarding the future of cannabis policy has taken on 50 shades of green.\nA spectrum of cannabis law reform options have emerged, ranging from decriminalizing small-scale possession, to the creation of a full-fledged commercial market for recreational cannabis.\nAt NORML Canada, we think it is important for cannabis law reformers to develop a clear image of what cannabis laws should be. It is no longer sufficient to simply lament prohibition. It is incumbent on our community to develop clear, reasoned and practical visions of the future.\nOver the coming months, NORML Canada will be developing its vision of the future. This project will culminate in the publication of NORML Canada’s cannabis reform proposal.\nThis proposal will elucidate out a detailed, pragmatic proposal to legalizing and regulating cannabis in Canada.\nAs we undertake this project, we hope to solicit input from our members regarding some of the key issues. Each month, our newsletter will contain a legalization issue we would like to hear input on.\nNORML Canada’s Legalization Issue of the Month:\nWhat, if any, age restrictions should be placed on legal cannabis use?\n(If possible, please justify your response.)\nR v Mernagh: when the law backs you into a corner\nFor Matthew Mernagh, the promise of future cannabis law reform must be bitter sweet. Suffering from a number of medical ailments, Mr. Mernagh found great relief from using medical cannabis. However, he was unable to find a doctor to support his medical marihuana use. Faced with a choice between debilitating illness and breaking the law, Mr. Mernagh chose the latter, and self-produced a small number of cannabis plants in his residence. In 2008, he was charged with the unlawful production of cannabis. What has transpired in the past five years has been rollercoaster ride through Canada’s legal system. In 2011, Taliano J of the Ontario Superior Court of Justice accepted Mr. Mernagh’s constitutionally protected rights were violated by a medical marihuana system utilizing unwilling and uncooperative physicians as gatekeepers. However, the victory was short-lived. In 2013, the Court of Appeal for Ontario overturned Taliano J. The court held Mr. Mernagh failed to provide sufficient evidence to prove qualified individuals were being improperly denied access to medical marihuana. Mr. Mernagh’s legal saga to invalidate and reform the medical marihuana regime in Canada entered its final chapter this week as his lawyer, our Mr. Paul Lewin, will file an application requesting leave to appeal the decision to the Supreme Court of Canada. Mr. Mernagh does not have an automatic right to appeal. He must obtain leave of the court. In determining whether to grant leave, the court’s primary concern is whether issues of national importance are raised in the appeal. Once the application is served and filed, the government will have an opportunity to respond. The application raises three issues. First, where marijuana is known to mitigate a significant medical ailment, is a blanket ban against possession arbitrary and overbroad? Must there be a ‘safety valve’ to allow an appropriate sufferer some access? Are the medical access regulations unconstitutional where it forces sufferers to arbitrarily ‘doctor shop’ until they find one willing to conduct a fair evaluation? Second, when criminal charges of possession are laid against a person with a significant medical illness that is ameliorated by marihuana, is the medical defence unavailable, simply because he did not comply with the access regulations? Third, the burden is on the claimant to establish the access regulations violate his Charter rights. To what degree must the claimant establish evidence of repeated arbitrary rejections, or patterns of other sick people suffering similar outcomes? It is hoped these issues will capture the national dimension of this issue. Mr. Mernagh adduced 22 patient witnesses from across this country. Countless others have faced similar experiences, unable to get the medical document required to obtain legal medical cannabis. Regardless of the outcome, Mr. Mernagh’s legal campaign is illustrative of the reform which can emerge from a criminal defence. When faced with an unjust legal regime, Mr. Mernagh chose to challenge it, rather than seek to make a deal and reduce his personal liabilities. However, Mr. Mernagh’s situation also illustrates equally the difficulties of using the criminal law to achieve legal reform. First, the criminal defence, by its nature, is reactive rather than proactive. Second, the legal procedures do not afford the accused with a sufficient chance to discover the government’s purpose and intention behind the law being challenged. Finally, the nature of appeals means even a resounding victory in the first instance does not make certain a positive end result. We would like to wish Mr. Mernagh the best of luck with his legal campaign.", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}
{"id": "2231", "text": "First and foremost, I want to state that I hope anyone reading this is healthy and safe during this unprecedented pandemic.\nMany of my colleagues are currently writing about workers’ compensation in regard to the coronavirus. The workers’ compensation act does cover occupational diseases and the bureau has specifically recognized COVID-19 as a recognized cause and condition. However, proving causation may be challenging given how widespread nature of the virus. If you feel that you have a potential claim do not hesitate to contact my office.\nThat said, I want to focus on a fairly frequent defense of insurance companies. They attempt to classify a worker as an independent contractor rather than an employee in order to avoid paying benefits for an injury on the job. In many cases, the lines are blurred. If you are injured on the job, these blurred lines could have catastrophic consequences.\nUnderstand the Basics\nOne of the basic principles that is nationwide among workers’ compensation systems is that employees are eligible for workers’ compensation but independent contractors are not. Many employers misclassify employees as “independent contractors” to avoid certain financial responsibilities such as being subject to the Pennsylvania Workers’ Compensation Act. As a worker in Pennsylvania, it is important to understand your rights.\nAre You an Employee or Contractor?\nEmployee or Independent Contractor: Who Makes the Call and How is it Made?\nThe distinction between employee vs. independent contractor in workers’ compensation is determined based upon factors that are similarly used in federal tax law. As boring as that sounds, it’s important to keep reading! An employer may tell you that you are being hired as an independent contractor or an employee, but it is ultimately up to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and how it classifies your work. The IRS looks at three key factors:\nA worker is an employee when the business has the right to direct and control the work performed by the worker, even if that right is not exercised. Decisions like when and where to work, what tools to use, degree of instruction, evaluations and training are all considered Behavioral Control.\nDoes the business have a right to direct or control the financial and business aspects of the worker’s job considering investments, profit and loss opportunity, methods of payment, etc?\nThe type of relationship depends upon how the worker and business perceive their interaction with one another including items like written contracts, benefits, the time frame of the relationship and if the services provided are they key aspects of the business.\nConstruction Workplace Misclassification Act (CWMA)\nIn the construction industry, independent contractors are commonly used and in 2011, Pennsylvania established a definition of “independent contractor” for purposes of workers’ compensation. The CWMA uses the following criteria for determining if a worker is an employee or independent contractor:\n- The individual must have a written contract to perform services;\n- The individual must be free from control or direction over the performances of such services;\n- The individual must be customarily engaged in an independently established trade, occupation or profession, with a separate business location; and\n- The individual must maintain liability insurance during the term of the contract.\nIn 2018, the requirements of the CWMA were put to the test when it reached the Appellate Courts with D & R Construction v WCAB. The court ruled that, for injuries occurring at construction sites on or after 2011, the injured worker will be deemed an employee, unless all of the mandatory criteria are in place for a finding of independent contractor status, pursuant to the CWMA. All criteria must be given equal weight by a Workers’ Compensation judge. If one is absent, the worker is deemed an employee.\nA Painter Hires a Drywall Expert: A Hypothetical Example\nA painter uses someone to handle drywall installation. The painter tells his drywall person that he can give him full time work but never indicates that he is an employee or independent contractor – no contract was drawn. The drywall workers is paid hourly and is expected to be on the job on a full time basis. The drywall worker gets injured on a job site. He or she can successfully file a workers’ compensation claim simply because he or she never signed any paperwork indicating he or she was hired as an independent contractor. Furthermore, the “behavioral control” and “financial control” aspects of the work make that the likely conclusion.\nWho’s The Boss\nIt often comes down to “Who’s the boss?” Is it the injured worker or the employer? Does the worker have independent use of his or her skill? Is he or she doing a certain piece of work at a fixed price for a lump sum or a measurable basis? Is he or she free to use whatever help to get the job done? Does he or she set his or her own hours? Who supplies the tools? Who controls the means and methods for completing the work.\nIf you have been denied workers’ compensation benefits and have been misclassified as an independent contractor, it is important to contact a certified workers’ compensation attorney.

{"id": "2239", "text": "It is essential that plaintiff’s attorneys are aware of the motions defense counsel will bring to delay and distract the case from moving forward. The two most common motions are a motion to dismiss and a motion for protective order. Plaintiff’s counsel must remember that just because the defendants file these motions does not mean they will succeed. Often times, it is simply a strategic move to delay the case. In any event, it is important to be informed about the motions that are likely to be filed.\nA motion to dismiss generally argues that claims fail on their face and no amount of discovery will make them successful. Defense counsel will generally file a motion to dismiss because it results in immediate victory if granted. In particular, the defense will argue that the petition fails to state a cause of action because the facility owes no duty to the resident. Instead, defense counsel may assert that the relationship of the facility and resident is like that of a landlord and tenant. In fact, many facilities even draft their resident agreements to reflect this theory. However, the evidence rarely reflects such an arrangement and as long as the allegations in the petition taken as true substantiate a claim then the motion to dismiss will be defeated.\nA request for a protective order is another common motion in nursing home negligence cases. Defense counsel files this motion in an effort to keep allegedly sensitive documents privileged or certain witnesses from being deposed. The best way to show that a document should not be the subject of a protective order is by establishing that it would be available through a Freedom of Information Act Request. Its difficult to argue that a document should be protected if it is also publicly available.\nNursing home negligence claims involve many complex legal and medical issues.

{"id": "2255", "text": "A casino is a gambling establishment that offers players games of chance in exchange for money. These games can include slot machines, video poker, blackjack, roulette, craps and baccarat. While casinos offer other entertainment like musical shows, lighted fountains and hotels, the vast majority of their profits are generated by gambling.\nThe casino is a place where the excitement of gambling and the glamour of Las Vegas combine. Millions of tourists visit Las Vegas every year to take in the sights and try their hand at winning some cash. While the gambling business is lucrative, it can also be dangerous. Casinos are regulated by state governments and operate with tight security measures.\nIn order to make the most money, a gambler needs to have a good understanding of the casino games and their rules. It is also helpful to learn how to manage your bankroll and stay within your budget. The best way to do this is by evaluating different casino options before making a decision. This will allow you to choose the one that is right for you.\nCasinos have a number of advantages over other forms of gambling, such as the lottery and Internet gaming. They provide a social atmosphere where players are often directly interacting with other people as they play games such as poker or craps, or surrounded by other people as they play slot machines. The noise and lighting of a casino are designed to stimulate the senses, and waiters frequently ring up alcoholic drinks for players. Nonalcoholic beverages and snacks are also available.\nMany states have legalized casinos, and Nevada is renowned for its enormous resorts. However, other states such as New Jersey and Atlantic City also have a large number of casinos. In addition, there are a growing number of Indian casinos located on American reservations and are not subject to state anti-gambling laws.\nThe main way that casinos earn money is through the house edge, which is built into all games of chance. This advantage is usually very small (less than two percent), but it adds up over the millions of bets placed by casino patrons. In addition, some casinos have other sources of revenue such as a “vig” or a rake taken by players in games such as poker where they are competing against each other.\nDuring the 1970s, Las Vegas casinos began offering a wide variety of perks to encourage and reward their best customers. These perks are known as comps and may include free hotel rooms, meals, show tickets and even airline and limo service. These perks are designed to increase the volume of gambling money that casino employees can generate. They are not always successful, however, because they often backfire and create compulsive gamblers who spend more than they can afford to lose.

{"id": "2267", "text": "When your website is slower than usual, Google Analytics shows a sudden spike in traffic, or your site keeps crashing, your first thought may be: “Am I being hacked?”\nA painfully slow or unresponsive website could indicate that you are indeed under a Distributed Denial of Service attack (DDoS attack).\nDDoS relies on botnets. They’re collections of infected devices (e.g. laptops, PCs, phones, or printers) controlled by a hacker and used to send high volumes of traffic to the targeted website.\nEvery website has a limit to how many requests it can accept per minute. Once traffic surpasses that, the site becomes overwhelmed.\nAs a result, it lags or has long downtimes.\nMany DDoS victims aren’t even aware of the attack. When they identify an attack, usually months later, it has already escalated and caused major financial losses.\nIt can be challenging to spot a DDoS attack early. Every year they become more advanced, hackers strike the victim with larger volumes of bots, and the attacks evolve to bypass the security solutions businesses normally have.\nSo how can you tell if you’ve come under a DDoS attack\nA sudden surge in traffic\nNot every sudden spike in traffic points to a DDoS attack. Consider the latest changes on your online inventory, large sales, or Google’s algorithm updates.\nFor eCommerce sites, more traffic might just mean that your business is doing well. Your product is popular, or the marketing is paying off.\nMajor sales, such as those on Black Friday or during the Christmas season, can lead to a sudden increase in traffic. Take into consideration the date and the time of the year.\nCheck if Google changed its SEO guidelines lately. Changes in the algorithm and your SEO practices will affect your traffic. They can either cause your traffic to suddenly drop or result in an increased number of visitors.\nGoogle Analytics (GA4) offers a detailed insight into your site’s regular traffic patterns. Here are a couple of questions to detect if the sudden surge of visitors on your website is genuine or a sign of bot traffic:\nIs the traffic focused on one specific site?\nAre all the visitors that flood the website coming from the same IP address or the same region?\nIs the bounce rate on your website higher than usual?\nDoes the traffic appear at a specific time of the day?\nHow long does the surge in visitors last every day?\nDo you have more traffic than ever, but no sales?\nDDoS attacks can be challenging to spot. You might notice that the website is a bit slower than normal. A long time to load the product sites and complete the purchase will result in a poor user experience.\nWithin Google Analytics, you might notice an increased bounce rate after many frustrated users abandon their shopping carts and leave the site.\nEssentially, you should look out for anomalies.\nFor example, it’s not likely that a spike in traffic will happen for exactly 15 minutes every day at 5 PM.\nAlsoall those visitors will rarelyll come from the same country. You might notice that your users are coming from countries that don’t normally visit your website.\nIn reality, your traffic wouldn’t normally come from one specific IP address or even from a single IP range either.\nErrors from the 500 series\nOne sign of a DDoS attack might be server-related errors, known as 500-error. They indicate that the server is getting more requests than its current resources can handle.\nFor example, a couple of these errors that can appear during a DDoS incident are:\n500 Internal Server Error that shows that something went wrong with the server, but it’s not clear what exactly\n503 error on the website that tells the user that the service is currently unavailable\n502 Bad Gateway that indicates a communication issue between the server and the service\nThese errors aren’t a definitive way to confirm a DDoS attack.\nBut they do show an overload of requests and troubles when attempting to communicate with the server — both of which are common during this type of cyber attack.\nAlerts on your security solutions\nHave your specialized security tools alerted your team of any anomalies and potentially suspicious traffic?\nIf you’re a company with a complex website, you know that it’s neither time nor cost-effective to seek these discrepancies manually.\nTherefore, you might already have a dedicated solution that blocks malicious bots right away.\nIf you’re a company with an IT team, the tools you have should alert the security analysts that a website or an entire application are possible hacking victim.\nThe DDoS protector you have should reduce the risk of an attack by using AI to scan your website or entire infrastructure all the time and detect the attack in seconds.\nWhat should you do if you’re under a DDoS attack?\nThe faster you uncover and start mitigating a DDoS attack, the lesser the cost of the aftermath. DDoS can cause expensive downtimes, require you to investigate the attack, and hire professionals to secure your site and prevent similar attacks in the future.\nIf it’s too late and you’ve already noticed a DDoS attack, some measures you can take are:\nActivating DDoS mitigation services to handle the surges of traffic\nAlerting your hosting provider of errors and suspicious traffic\nIsolating malicious bot traffic from legitimate traffic\nIncreasing the bandwidth of your server\nDisclosing the attack to your users\nNotifying law enforcement\nHowever, the best you can do for your website is to choos a reliable hosting service. Then, draft a recovery plan and have cybersecurity solutions that can uncover the DDoS attacks in seconds.\nIdentity Management (IAM) is a fundamental security component for businesses that want to secure their data and applications. IAM manages who has access to what, and makes sure that only authorized people have access to the information and systems they require.\nThere are many different methods for implementing IAM, and the subject is complex. The basic ideas, on the other hand, are constant:\nModern IAM must be centrally planned and managed.\nOther security measures must be used in conjunction with AWS Identity and Access Management.\nIAM must be adaptable to meet the changing demands of a dynamic company.\nThere are several commercial and open source IAM solutions accessible, but they all have one thing in common: careful planning and implementation is required. You’ll be pleasantly surprised to hear that two of the most dependable IAM firms have collaborated to provide a new solution that is both simple to use and highly effective.\nNow that Okta has collaborated with Squareball, we’ll look at the significance of this new partnership in this post.\nOkta partner Squareball, is a German company that specializes in the creation, design, and implementation of IAM-oriented applications, platforms, internal systems, and services.

This includes its devices, networks, appliances and information stores. Due to the proliferation of advanced threats, it is important to collect context from multiple sources. The SOC is basically the point of correlation for all events that are logged within an organization. The SOC must determine how each event will be handled and acted on.\nSecurity personnel and organizational structure\nA security operation team (or, more often, a security center) is responsible for monitoring, investigating, responding to, and investigating cyberthreats 24 hours a day. Security operations teams are responsible for protecting intellectual property, business systems, brand integrity, and personnel data. Security operations teams are the core of an organization’s overall cybersecurity strategy. They act as the point of convergence in coordinated efforts to assess, monitor, and defend against cyberattacks.\nSOCs are typically built around a hub and spoke architecture. This allows for a wide range of systems to be integrated, including vulnerability assessment solutions (GRC), application and database scanners (IPS), entity and user behavior analytics ( UEBA), endpoint discovery and remediation ( ), threat intelligence platforms (TIP).\nSOC managers usually lead the group. They may include threat hunters, incident responders, SOC analysts (levels 1, 2, and 3), and incident response manager(s). The SOC reports directly to the CEO or the CIO.\nStage 1: Event Classification and Triage\nWhat is the importance of this?\nLog data analysis is a valuable tool that allows you to correlate and analyze log data. Key indicators of compromise include user activity, system events, firewall acceptance/denies, and firewall accept/denies. You should also be alerted to specific sequences or combinations of these events within specific patterns. This stage is crucial for success. You need to be able to quickly classify events so you can prioritize and escalate important events that require further investigation.\nWhat do SOC Analysts do at this Stage?\nThe latest events with the greatest severity or criticality are reviewed by Tier 1 SOC analysts. After confirming that these events warrant further investigation, they will escalate the matter to a Tier2 Security Analyst. Please note that smaller teams may have the same analyst who investigates issues as they escalate into a more detailed investigation. Documenting all activity is key to success at this stage (e.g. notation, trouble ticket, etc).\nIt is crucial to identify attacker activity early in an attack before sensitive data or systems are compromised. It is more likely that attackers will succeed in their attacks as they move up the kill chain stages. You can identify which events need your attention by looking at infrastructure activity and environmental behavior from the attacker’s point of view.\nStage 2: Prioritization and Analysis\nWhat is the importance of this?\nPrioritization is key to success in all endeavors, but it is even more important in cyber security. The stakes are high, and the rate of attacks is increasing at an alarming pace that shows no signs of slowing down. The resources available to protect assets from this attack are very limited. You need to focus on the events that have the greatest impact on business operations. This requires you to know which assets are most important. The most important responsibility of the SOC team is to ensure business continuity.\nWhat do SOC Analysts do at this Stage?\nAny activity that suggests an adversary has infiltrated the environment should be reviewed and addressed. This could include the installation of a rootkit/RAT, backdoor or other means to exploit an existing vulnerability in network communications between an external host and a known bad address associated with cyber adversaries’ C2 infrastructure.\nStage 3: Recovery & Remediation\nWhat is the importance of this?\nYou can prevent similar attacks from occurring by responding quickly to any incident you detect. It is important to note that there are many decisions to be made when investigating an incident. This includes whether your organization is more concerned with recovering from the damage than investigating it as a criminal offense. Your management team should be involved in your investigation. Communicate clearly and frequently with your management team. Document everything.\nWhat do SOC Analysts do at this Stage?\nAlthough each attack is different in terms of the correct remediation steps that should be taken on affected systems, it will usually involve one or more the following steps:\nRe-image your systems and restore backups\nUpdate or patch systems (e.g. Update apps and OS versions\nSystem access can be re-configured (e.g. Account removals, password resets\nMonitor servers and assets for vulnerabilities (e.g. Enable HIDS\nRun vulnerability scans to validate patching procedures and security controls\nSome SOC teams also delegate remediation and recovery tasks to other IT groups. In such cases, the SOC analyst would open a ticket or change control request and then delegate it to system and desktop operations.\nStage 4: Audit & Assessment\nWhat is the importance of this?\nIt is always best to fix vulnerabilities as soon as possible to prevent attackers from gaining access to your environment. It is best to conduct periodic vulnerability assessments, and then review the report findings. These assessments will not identify procedural vulnerabilities, but technical ones. Make sure that your team also addresses gaps in your SOC processes that could put you at risk.\nWhat do SOC Analysts Do at this Stage?\nSOC team members are most commonly responsible for running network vulnerability scans or generating compliance reports. SOC team members can also review their SOC processes and share them with external audit teams (internal or extern) in order to ensure policy compliance and to determine how to improve SOC group performance.\nThe SOC performs 10 key functions\n1. Take stock of all available resources\nThe SOC is responsible to two types of assets: the various processes, applications, and devices they are charged with protecting, and the defensive tools that they have at their disposal to ensure that protection.\nWhat the SOC Protects Devices and data that the SOC cannot see can’t be protected. There are likely to be gaps in the network security posture without visibility and control, from the device to the cloud. The SOC’s goal in gaining a comprehensive view of the threat landscape of the company includes all types of endpoints, servers, and software, as well as third-party services and traffic between them.\nThe SOC Protects A complete knowledge of all cybersecurity tools and workflows used within the SOC is essential for the SOC. This improves agility and allows the SOC run at its peak efficiency\n2. Preparation and preventative maintenance\nEven the most agile and well-equipped response systems are not able to prevent problems from happening in the first place. The SOC has two major categories of preventative measures that can be used to keep attackers away.\nPreparation Keep your team informed about the latest security trends, cybercrime developments and new threats. This research can be used to help create a security roadmap for the company that will guide its cybersecurity efforts moving forward. It will also include a disaster recovery plan that will offer guidance in the worst-case scenario.\nPreventative Maintenance This step covers all actions that are taken to make successful attacks more difficult. These include regularly updating and maintaining existing systems, updating firewall policies, patching vulnerabilities, and whitelisting, blocking, and securing apps.\n3. Continuous Proactive Monitoring\nThe SOC uses tools to scan the network 24 hours a day to identify suspicious activity or anomalies. The SOC can monitor the network 24/7 to alert them of any emerging threats. This gives them the best chance of preventing or minimising harm. A SIEM, an EDR or an EDR are all possible monitoring tools. Better still, an SOAR, or an XDR can be used to use behavioral analysis to teach systems the difference between normal day-to-day operations or actual threat behavior. This reduces the amount of human triage and analysis.\n4. Alert Management and Ranking\nThe SOC is responsible for reviewing all alerts issued by monitoring tools, discarding false positives and determining how serious any threats might be. This allows them to quickly triage any emerging threats and deal with the most pressing issues first.\n5. Threat Response\nThese are the actions that most people associate with the SOC. The SOC is the first responder when an incident is confirmed. They perform actions such as shutting down or isolating any endpoints, stopping harmful processes from executing, deleting files and many other tasks. It is important to provide a quick response that has minimal impact on business continuity.\n6. Remediation and Recovery\nThe SOC will restore data and systems in the wake of an incident. The SOC may need to wipe and restart endpoints, reconfigure systems, or in the case ransomware attacks deploy viable backups to avoid the ransomware. This will restore the network to its previous state if it is successful.\n7. Log Management\nThe SOC is responsible to collect, maintain, and review the logs of all communications and network activity for the entire organization. These data can help establish a baseline of “normal” network activity and reveal threats. They can also be used to remediate and forensically investigate the incident. Many SOCs use SIEMs to combine and correlate data feeds from applications and firewalls.\n8. Root Cause Investigation\nThe SOC is responsible for investigating the incident’s aftermath to determine what happened, when and how it occurred. The SOC uses log data, as well as other information, to track down the source of the problem. This will allow them to prevent similar incidents from happening in the future.\n9. Security Improvement and Refinement\nCybercriminals constantly improve their tactics and tools. The SOC must implement continuous improvements to keep them ahead. This step will bring to life the Security Road Map’s plans, but it can also involve hands-on practice such as red-teaming or purple-teaming.\n10. Compliance Management\nWhile many of the SOC’s processes follow established best practices, some are subject to compliance requirements. Regular audits of the SOC’s systems are required to ensure compliance with regulations. These regulations may be issued by the organization, their industry or by governing bodies. These regulations include HIPAA, GDPR, and PCI DSS. These regulations can help protect sensitive data the company has been given, but it can also protect the organization from reputational damage or legal challenges that may result from a breach.\nOptimizing security operations models\nThe SOC is primarily responsible for incident management, but the chief information security officer (CISO), is responsible to ensure compliance and risk management. An adaptive security architecture is required to bridge the operational and data silos between these functions. It allows organizations to implement optimized security operations. This approach improves efficiency by integrating, automating, and orchestrating. It also reduces labor hours and improves information security management.\nA security framework is essential to optimize security operations. It makes it simple to integrate security solutions with threat intelligence into daily processes. SOC tools such as centralized and actionable dashboards integrate threat data into security monitoring dashboards. Reports are used to keep management and operations informed about any changes. SOC teams can improve their overall risk management by linking threat management to other systems that manage risk and compliance. These configurations allow for continuous visibility across domains and systems. They can also use actionable intelligence to improve accuracy and consistency in security operations. Centralized functions make it easier to share data, audit and report across the board.\nA thorough assessment is essential in order to operationalize threat management. An organization must evaluate its processes and policies, in addition to its defenses. What are the strengths of your organization? What are the weaknesses? What is your risk profile? What data are you collecting and how much data are you using?\nEvery organization is unique, but there are certain core capabilities that every company should have and best security operations practices. A plan is the first step in a reasonable threat management process. It includes discovery (including baseline calculations to promote anomaly detection and normalization and correlation), triage (based upon risk and asset value), analysis, contextualization, scoping, and iterative investigation. Interruption response programs are fed from the prioritized and characterized incidents managed by threat management processes. It is essential to have a well-crafted response plan in place to contain a threat and minimize the damage caused by a data breach.\nAlthough there are many data sources available for effective visibility and threat management, it can be difficult to find the most useful and current information. Event data from countermeasures and IT assets, indicators or compromise (IoCs), produced internally (via malware analyses) and externally via threat intelligence feeds, and system data collected by sensors (e.g. host, network, and database). These are the most valuable data. ).\nThese data sources are more than just an input for threat management. They provide context and make the data valuable and actionable, allowing for more accurate, precise and quick assessment during the interactive and iterative threat management process. Organization maturity is measured by the ability to access and make effective use of the relevant data to support plans or procedures. A mature scenario is one that has a workflow that allows for direct action within the operational consoles or across products. This flows integrates IT operations with security teams and tools to provide incident response for critical events.\nThese assessments will help you prioritize areas where more investment or less friction is required to achieve your threat management implementation goals. Penetration tests and consultants can help to benchmark strategy, organizational maturity, and security response to attacks in order to determine the current level of an organization’s ability detect and contain malicious events. This vetted review, which compares against other enterprises, can help to justify and explain the need for cybersecurity operations resources to be redirected or invested in.\nIncreasingly, we see an organizational move away from the use of passwords, at least in the traditional sense. Companies are working to meet the changing demands of more remote and hybrid work. They need to ensure that users can access resources securely but remain productive.\nBoth are part of a Zero Trust architecture, and along with these concepts, many are questioning whether or not passwords will become altogether obsolete. Below, we explore the topic.\nPasswords are Still Alive… for Now\nThe discussion about the death of the password started nearly 20 years ago at the RSA Security Conference. In 2004, passwords were described as not being able to meet the challenge of securing critical resources. At that time, it was said their extinction was inevitable.\nHere we are, all this time later, and passwords are still with us, but their death is still being discussed.\nEven though we have made tremendous advances in so many technology areas, we still rely on passwords for security.\nLast year, hackers were able to breach Colonial Pipeline Company with one single compromised password. After shutting down the largest fuel pipeline in the country, the hackers were able to walk away with $4.4 million.\nThat left many once again questioning why passwords are still so often used as the only authentication factor.\nWhile passwords are alive, largely due to convenience, their ability to be your company’s sole source of protection is very much dead.\nThat brings the world to the multi-factor authentication (MFA) era.\nRecent research finds that the word itself, password, is still being used as the most common password in all industries. Other passwords that are commonly used include Hello123 and sunshine.\nAround 20% of passwords researchers recently uncovered were either the exact company name or a small variation.\nIn some industries, employees have their particular types of a weak passwords. For example, in the financial sector research, profit was a common one, and in energy, it was snowman.\nWe can think back to the SolarWinds hack, which was triggered by someone using the password solarwinds123 to protect a secure server.\nCompany officials say the weak password wasn’t the reason for the hack, but they were warned of a weak password by a security expert, and then took two years to change it.\nIn 2019, according to Verizon’s Data Breach Investigations Report, compromised credentials were the reason for 80% of all data breaches.\nPhishing scams are the most common type of cyberattack directed at passwords. In a phishing scam, employees give their credentials in response to fake emails or spoofed websites.\nA cybercriminal can also use automated tools like a brute force to guess passwords.\nCyber attackers can steal credentials through malware or from database dumps of stolen passwords or try to crack coded versions of a password that an organization stores in their system.\nIt’s very difficult for anyone to remember a random, complex password. The average online user also has at least dozens of accounts online, requiring a password. There’s a very high likelihood that they’ll use the same or at least a very similar password across sites, and often both business and personal accounts.\nHow Can Multi-Factor Authentication Help?\nWe can talk about passwords being dead or obsolete all we want, but the reality is the conversation is decades in the making, and we’re still using them.\nRather than planning for passwords to be entirely obsolete, it’s better to consider other security measures—namely, multi-factor authentication or MFA.\nThere are password replacement options, although they might not be the right fit for every organization right now.\nSome organizations are using passphrases rather than passwords. A passphrase is a longer mix of words, and it can add curveballs to the typical password. While passphrases are one option, you have to remember they’re still going to be incredibly weak if they’re being reused.\nOrganizations are increasingly adopting single sign-on. With single sign-on, the end-user experience is easier because the users can rely on one username and password to access various programs and services. However, the problem here comes in when a cybercriminal gets access to all systems if they compromise the SSO itself.\nWe talked about multi-factor authentication above, and if you talk to cybersecurity professionals, they’ll tell you how valuable it is. We briefly went into how it works, but MFA lets your users access data by providing two of three possible things. The first is something you know, which can be a password but also a PIN. Then, the second can be something you have. This is also called an ownership factor. It could be a physical item, like a smartphone. The third is something you are, also known as biometric factors. Biometric factors can include voice recognition, fingerprints, or retina scans.\nPasswordless authentication systems rely on two elements of MFA—something you have and something you are. There’s no password that your users have to remember or that can potentially be stolen. Many of these passwordless systems will include some public-key cryptography that will generate a unique key to log in with.", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}

This is such a easy way to give your pumpkins a makeover without having to spend a ton of money on the fancy pumpkins from store. Such an easy fall painted pumpkin craft!\nWhile decorating for fall this year, I decided I was “over” the orange pumpkin look and wanted my pumpkins to have more neutral, soft tones to them.\nBy the way, if you’d like to see my favorite fall decor picks this year, click right here!\nCollecting my materials for my painted pumpkin craft\nTo start with, I collected all the orange pumpkins I had. Some were from the dollar store, the others were from the dollar spot at Target.\nThen, I searched through my paint to find colors that I wanted to use on the pumpkin. I used a lot of the sample paints I’ve collected.\nLastly, I wanted to add texture to the pumpkin — similar to a concrete vibe — so I grabbed my baking powder and baking soda.\nI grabbed both because I wanted to test each one. I had a clear winner almost immediately so let’s talk about that!\nUsing baking powder and paint\nWhen I mixed the baking powder and paint, it started to “poof up” almost immediately. The paint became very dry and pastey and it was a bit too much texture for my liking.\nI dabbed the paint on and it took a few coats to really cover the pumpkin.\nYou can see above that the pumpkin is very lumpy and how poofy/airy the paint became. I was really wanting more of a concrete texture so I tried the baking soda next so that I could compare.\nUsing baking soda and paint\nAlmost immediately I could tell that this was going to be the texture I was looking for. I used baking soda and paint for the rest of the pumpkins.\nStyling my pumpkins\nNow that my pumpkins had a new look, I wanted to style them on my coffee table.\nI grabbed a wooden tray from Hobby Lobby and arranged my pumpkins. When styling, I try to pay attention to the overall balance of things. Meaning, I try to mix up the sizes of things and not place two items that are too close in color and size together.\nI added in a few acorns and I was done!\nUpgrade your dollar store pumpkins with this easy fall craft!\n- Baking soda\n- Add paint to bowls and mix in baking soda (1 spoonful at a time until desired consistency)\n- Tape off pumpkin stem if you don't want to get paint on it\n- Dab paint on pumpkin\n- Let dry\n- I tested baking powder vs baking soda to be the texture I liked. Feel free to test them for yourself! baking powder had more texture than I was looking for.\n- I personally chose to use paint that I already had, including samples I had collected as well as pumpkins I already owned and wanted to upgrade so this project did not cost me anything.\n- Style your pumpkins by mixing up the colors, sizes and shapes!

{"id": "2374", "text": "Every day, news headlines blare the latest developments of the crisis in Israel. The Jewish state has had to respond to unrestrained terror against its citizens by finding and eliminating the terrorist networks.\nThe press largely portrays terrorists as victims and heroes, while almost unanimously condemning Israel’s reaction. Three decades of “negotiations” with the Palestinians have produced broken agreements, more terrorism and no peace!\nTo understand this conflict, the participants and their motives must be understood. We start with how the area received its name.\nOrigin of the Name Palestine\nThe name Palestine encompasses the ancient Holy Land and the modern nation of Israel. But it is not the original name for that country. The Romans assigned this name about the second century A.D.\nTo appreciate the pressure brought upon the Jews in Judea and Jerusalem during this time, some background is necessary.\nA Jewish revolt occurred just before A.D. 70, when the Romans sacked Jerusalem after a bitter siege. The revolt was caused by ongoing provocations by the Roman occupation forces. Roman officials continually stole valuables from Jewish priests, demanding ransom for their return. They plundered the temple and looted the priests’ ornamental garments—along with other sacred treasures. This surpassed the breaking point, and the inevitable revolt began (Wars of the Jews, Josephus, bk. 2, ch. 14-16).\nDistorted historical accounts and Hollywood portray the Romans as cool-headed, rational, military types. However, this was hardly the case.\nThe survivors of the A.D. 70 revolt were subjected to similar provocations that led to another revolt in A.D. 132. The Romans prevailed again, and the revolt ended in A.D. 135. The Roman Emperor Hadrian (Publius Aelius Hadrianus) punished the surviving Jews.\nHe renamed Jerusalem after himself and the god Jupiter Capitolinus—Aelia Capitolina. He then imposed the death penalty on any Jew who would enter the city.\nSome historians feel that this period was most likely the time that the Romans renamed Judea as Palestina (or Palestine). Others believe the change occurred about a century or so later, after Constantine established the eastern (Byzantine) part of the Roman Empire. Notice: “Till the period of the Roman occupation it [the Mid-East area later designated as “Palestine”] was subdivided into independent provinces or kingdoms…but never united under one collective designation. The extension of the name of Palestine beyond the limits of Philistia proper is not older than the Byzantine Period” (Encyclopedia Britannica, 11th ed., Vol. 20, p. 601).\nSo, the Roman term “Palestine” came into existence well after Scripture had been written and canonized. The term “Aelia Capitolina” did not last for Jerusalem, but “Palestine” became a more permanent name for the region including and surrounding Judea. Understandably, the Jews who have lived there since then have rejected that name.\nHoly Land Never Called Palestine in Scripture\nSome believe that Israel today was once called Palestine millennia ago. The word Palestine does not occur in the original Hebrew or Greek Bible texts. The Hebrew term Pelesheth, which refers to the land of the ancient Philistines—Philistia—is erroneously translated in the King James Version as “Palestina” in Exodus 15:14 and in Isaiah 14:29 and 31, and as “Palestine” in Joel 3:4. The New King James Version correctly reads “Philistia”—the land of the Philistines—in every case noted above.\nThe Bible does not use the term “Palestine” or “Palestinians” to designate any geographic location or people. Nor does the historian Josephus ever use these terms in his major works, Antiquities of the Jews and Wars of the Jews. These relatively recent terms cannot change history—much less Scripture.\nIn the New Testament, other terms denote the territories of that region. For example, in Luke 1:5, Herod (the Great) is King of Judea. In Luke 3:1, we find other references: Pontius Pilate, governor of Judea; Herod (Antipas), Tetrarch of Galilee; Philip, Tetrarch of Ituraea (northeast of Judea); and Lysancas, Tetrarch of Abilene (near Ituraea). Notice that there is no “king,” “governor” or “tetrarch” of Palestine found anywhere in Scripture—more proof that “Palestine” was not an ancient term.\nSecular History Finds “Palestine” Without Merit\nNotice the following: “PALESTINE, a geographical name of rather loose application. Etymological strictness would require it to denote exclusively the narrow strip of coastland once occupied by the Philistines, from whose name it is derived…The modern subdivisions under the jurisdiction of the Ottoman Empire are in no sense conterminous [having common boundaries] with those of antiquity, and hence do not afford a boundary by which Palestine can be separated exactly from the rest of Syria in the north, or from the Sinaitic and Arabian deserts in the south…” (Encyclopedia Britannica, 11th ed., p. 600).\nThese historians strongly imply that (1) the boundaries are obscure, (2) the territorial name breaks many ancient language rules, and (3) at best, the name is a “loose application.” (The boundaries were in effect in 1910, when this source was written. The Ottoman Empire still controlled the region, and Judea was designated as part of Syria.)\nIn short, by God’s standards, the term “Palestine” is illegitimate. (This will be covered later.) To name the entire region in honor of the Philistines—bitter enemies of Israel for centuries—insults the Jews. The Romans chose this name because they knew it would be an abomination to the Jews. For these reasons, some informed political leaders and statesmen still denounce the term “Palestine.” One of the more notable is Lady Margaret Thatcher (former prime minister of Britain), one of the few public figures not intimidated by “political correctness.”\nThe Peoples of the Mid-East\nWhile they were still in Egypt, God revealed to Israel how they would obtain the land of Canaan—the Promised Land: “And I am come down to deliver them [Israelites] out of the hand of the Egyptians, and to bring them up out of that land unto a good land and a large [land], unto a land flowing with milk and honey; unto the place of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites” (Ex. 3:8).\nThese peoples, as far as lineages can be traced, were descendants of Ham. Collectively, they were called Canaanites, and the land was often referred to as Canaan (Gen. 10:15-20).\nPalestinians today insist that they inhabited the land of Canaan before God gave it to Israel. But they are either seriously misinformed or willfully ignorant. The Canaanites described above were definitely not of Arab descent. The Arabic peoples are descendants of Ishmael, who descended from Shem. The peoples of Tunisia, Malta, Algeria and Sicily of today are of similar descent as these Canaanites.\nThe peoples who now call themselves Palestinians correctly acknowledge the common ancestry of Abraham, just as the Jews and Arabs claim.\nLet’s review some of this tribal lineage to better understand the origin of the Jews and Arabs.\nAbraham had two sons: Isaac (by his wife, Sarah) and Ishmael (by Hagar, her handmaid). Though Abraham passed the birthright to Isaac, Ishmael was also blessed, becoming the progenitor of the Arabs. Twelve princes, sons of Ishmael (Gen. 25:16), went on to form major Arab nations—not insignificant nomadic tribes. These peoples intermarried primarily with the Egyptians and were located south of Canaan, known as Arabia.\nIsaac had two sons: Jacob and Esau. Abraham and Isaac’s God-given birthright was passed on to Jacob. Esau, like his uncle Ishmael, was also blessed with wealth and offspring. He moved away from Canaan to a region called Mount Seir, just south of the land of Moab (southeast of the Dead Sea). Esau was also called Edom, and his offspring were known as Edomites. Many rulers, nobles and kings were borne of Esau (Gen. 36). Esau married Mahalath, the daughter of Ishmael (Gen. 28:9). He also had a number of wives from various other nations. His offspring continued to marry into the families of Ishmael, as well as other peoples.\nMeanwhile, Jacob, whose name God changed to Israel, had twelve sons—Reuben, Simeon, Levi, Judah, Zebulon, Issachar, Dan, Gad, Asher, Naphtali, Joseph and Benjamin—the twelve tribes of Israel. While in Egypt for nearly two and a half centuries, the tribes of Israel grew vastly in numbers. The birthright was passed from Jacob (or Israel) to Joseph’s sons, Ephraim and Manasseh. Israel effectively became thirteen tribes. The birthright remained with Ephraim and Manasseh, and began to be fulfilled in about A.D. 1800.\nIsrael and Judah\nAfter the time of King Solomon, Israel split into two nations: Judah and Israel (to the north of Judah). Judah consisted of the tribes of Judah and Benjamin, as well as the majority of Levi. These peoples became known as Jews. In fact, the Bible’s first use of the word “Jews” is in II Kings 16:6, when the Jews (allied with Syria) were at war with Israel.\nThe northern ten tribes of Israel were taken captive by the Assyrians in 721-718 B.C. and became known as the “lost ten tribes of Israel.” The Jews remained in the land of Judah (later Judea). The Assyrians placed other peoples in the land formerly inhabited by the ten tribes. Transplanted from a region near Babylon, these new inhabitants were called Samaritans.\nIn about 600 B.C., the Jews were taken captive by the Babylonians. A remnant of them returned approximately 70 years later. The vast majority of the Jews remained dispersed among other nations after the captivity. The Jews who returned faced continual opposition by certain peoples, such as the Samaritans and the peoples of Ammon and Moab. The Ammonites and Moabites—sons of Lot, Abraham’s nephew—were distant relatives of the Jews. The Jews’ most bitter rivals were none other than the Edomites—sons of Esau.\nLater, as Alexander the Great’s Empire dominated the region, such local rivalries were suppressed. The series of ongoing wars between the Seleucid and Ptolemy Empires—fragments of Alexander’s former Empire—dominated the second century B.C.\nNext came the Roman era and their provocation of the Jewish religious leaders, as mentioned earlier.\nThe Masses of Palestine\nMajor population shifts occurred in the area before the Jews’ arrival between 1917 and 1948: “The spread of Islam introduced a very considerable Neo-Arabian infusion. Those from southern Arabia were known as the Yaman tribe, those from northern Arabia the Kais (Qais). These two divisions absorbed the previous peasant population, and still nominally exist [as of 1910]; down to the middle of the 19th century they were a fruitful source of quarrels and of bloodshed.” (Encyclopedia Britannica, 11th ed., Vol. 20, p. 604). Note that these people were inclined toward quarreling and infighting.\nThe “infusion” of Arabians coincided with the expansion of Islam. Their presence in the Holy Land began about the seventh century A.D. These waves of migration continued as the Turks pushed north, and west, spreading Islam by the edge of the sword. By the tenth century A.D., the Turks had conquered the former land of Judea, as well as Jordan, Syria, and Lebanon. By the eleventh century, they controlled the bulk of Asia Minor. The Arabians—descendants of Ishmael as well as Esau—claimed the land from that time until the present.\nMany of the particular nationalities that live in Judea and Jerusalem do not intermix and intermarry with other peoples or nationalities.\nNotice this reference about the Samaritans: “The most interesting of all the non-Arab communities in the country, however, is without doubt the Samaritan sect in Nablus (Shechem); a gradually disappearing body, which has maintained an independent existence from the time they were first settled by the Assyrians to occupy the land left waste by the captivity of the kingdom of Israel” (Ibid.).\nLike the Samaritans, the original Canaanite nations and the Philistines also diminished in size and had long since emigrated. Much of this occurred during the time of David and Solomon. An example is the Hivites, who were “hewers of wood and drawers of water” (Josh. 9:21). “And all the people that were left of the Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites, which were not of the children of Israel, their children that were left after them in the land, whom the children of Israel also were not able utterly to destroy, upon those did Solomon levy a tribute of bondservice unto this day” (I Kgs. 9:20-21).\nModern descendants of these former bond servants exist only in occasional lineages of certain modern inhabitants of the nation of Israel. The percentage of that bloodline would only be small, being diluted by many generations.\nArabs comprise the bulk of the remaining residents. Not only did the term “Palestine” originate as late as the Byzantine era, the Arabs who call themselves “Palestinian” did not lay claim to the Holy Land until about the tenth century A.D.\nRelatively few Arabs were in the region when the Jews returned in 1917. Shortly before then, the population of the Holy Land was estimated at about 650,000 permanent residents. More than 65% were Islamic (Ibid.). Only after the Jews established their nation in 1948 did the masses of these Arabic peoples feel drawn to this particular territory. The population of Palestinians swelled dramatically after the Jews brought about vast improvements in agricultural production. They established irrigation and re-introduced efficient means of agriculture.\nUnderstandably, many took advantage of gainful employment provided by the Jews in developing the land and building a needed infrastructure for the tiny nation of Israel. These local laborers were called fellahin, or agricultural workers. Previously, the Arabs had only used primitive methods. Without the innovations introduced by the Jews, the fellahin had been restrained by their own superstitions, which prohibited advancements and efficiency in agriculture. So, initially, a mutual benefit existed, and the two peoples worked together.\nBut the Jews were never welcomed by Arab leaders who harbored jealousy and ancient resentment. No consideration was given to the willingness of the Jews to advance the cause of the fellahin.\nGolda Meir, former Prime Minister of Israel, offered some insightful comments on this. Herbert W. Armstrong, a friend and confidant of Mrs. Meir and many other Middle Eastern leaders, recorded her words in 1971. Keep in mind that these statements followed the 1967 War:\n“Then she told us of the Israelis’ ability and willingness to help their Arab neighbors. This small but remarkable nation now sends its experts and its technology throughout the deepest parts of Africa and to even more remote places in the world to help under-developed nations.\n“‘How easy it would be,’ she said earnestly, ‘to send the same teams across the border into Jordan, or across the canal into Egypt, and how much prosperity and happiness would be brought to this entire area of the world by peace...\n“‘We don’t want to have to go on winning more and more victories,’ she added. ‘We only want peace...’”\nThen Mr. Armstrong reflected upon Mrs. Meir’s words: “What a deplorable tragedy that the whole world cannot now have the kind of peace, with prosperity and happiness that Prime Minister Golda Meir expressed a desire for—each nation cooperating with its neighbor.\n“But the reason is summed up in the biblical statement: ‘The way of peace they know not.’ There has, of necessity, to be a cause for every effect. There will have to be a cause to produce peace. That cause is a way of life” (Autobiography of Herbert W. Armstrong, Vol. 2, pp. 500-501).\nToday, Palestinian leaders and Islamic clerics have rejected gestures of mutual cooperation from the Jews, because their ancient hatreds stand in the way. Their only plan regarding Israel is nothing less than the extinction of all Jews.\nOwnership of the territory is another controversial issue. The Palestinians claim to be the ancient owners of Palestine. Yet we see that they only took possession of the land in the wake of the Turkish campaign through that region in about the tenth century A.D. The claim made by ancient Israel precedes this claim by about 2,300 years.\nHow ironic that these Palestinians accuse the Jews of depriving them of their home when (1) the vast majority of them moved to Israel after the Jews reclaimed the land from desolation and ruin, and (2) their Arab relatives in the world of Islam own over 1,000 times more real estate than exists within the boundaries of tiny Israel. Remember when thousands of Palestinians were expelled from Kuwait in 1991 after they were found conspiring with the Iraqis in selling out their host country?\nThe following scriptures show how the true Owner of this and all land everywhere expressed this “land transfer”: “And the Lord gave unto Israel all the land which He swore to give unto their fathers; and they possessed it, and dwelt therein. And the Lord gave them rest round about, according to all that He swore unto their fathers: and there stood not a man of all their enemies before them; the Lord delivered all their enemies into their hand. There failed not ought of any good thing which the Lord had spoken unto the house of Israel; all came to pass” (Josh. 21:43-45).\nJoshua 24:13 covers more details: “And I [the Lord] have given you a land for which you did not labor, and cities which you built not, and you dwell in them; of the vineyards and oliveyards which you planted not do you eat.”\nThe Coming Solution\nToday, the Islamic Arabs (descendants of Ishmael and Esau) bear the same rivalry and suspicion of the Jews that they have always borne for Israel. But that rivalry is greatly intensified by Islamic fundamentalists advocating the destruction of the Jews and Israel. The most dangerous enemy of the west—as well as the Jews—is the incessant Islamic message that fuels the flames of hatred and vengeance, which fuels the fires of terrorism.\nThe Palestinians have lived near the Jews for over half a century. This closeness to the “enemy” makes them of great value to the perpetuators of terrorism. Thus, the Palestinians have served as surrogates for the states who sponsor terrorism, namely Syria, and Iran, confronting the Jews with escalating terrorism, at every opportunity.\nTo see through the smoke surrounding the Mid-East crisis, a clear understanding of Palestine and the Palestinians is critical. We live in momentous times. Events in this crucial area will soon impact everyone!\nThis millennia-old hatred will soon come to a boil, instigated by the “god of this world,” Satan the devil (II Cor. 4:4). He is the source of human nature, the source of all wars, evils, and mass confusion: “From whence come wars and fightings among you? Come they not hence, even of your lusts that war in your members? You lust, and have not: you kill and desire to have, and cannot obtain: you fight and war, yet you have not because you ask not. You ask, and receive not, because you ask amiss, that you may consume it upon your lusts” (Jms. 4:1-3).\nSatan is the great deceiver; so great that most do not believe that he even exists (Rev. 12:9). (Read our free booklets Who Is the Devil?, A World in Captivity, and Did God Create Human Nature?, to learn more.)\nReal peace—the kind that lasts forever—will not come before the end of this age. (For more information read our free booklet How World Peace Will Come!. You will find this to be an incredible eye-opener.) The present dilemma will not be solved until the arrival of the King of Peace—Jesus Christ—and the kingdom of God.", "scores": {"score": 3, "score_transform_1": 5, "score_transform_2": 5, "score_transform_3": 0}}

It was one of the largest projects of its kind in the world. Audi assumed responsibility for what is known as requirements analysis, which served as the basis for the project’s basic framework. In addition, engineers at the brand directed several individual projects – including the traffic light phase assistant, road preview and extended navigation. Audi participation was rounded out by its work in the area of the intersection assistant. The Audi test fleet consisted of 20 vehicles.\nIn the traffic light phase assistant project, 20 traffic light systems in the vicinity of Frankfurt am Main were retrofitted so that the test fleet could communicate with them. The goal of developers was to achieve the most efficient flow of traffic in metropolitan areas. Audi contributed from its extensive knowledge base that was acquired in its travolution project. That project was started back in 2006.\nInformation from the traffic light systems is transmitted to the car and visualized as graphic images on the driver information system display. They show the driver the speed to select in order to reach the next traffic light during a green phase. Acoustic signals also warn the driver in advance of red phases. Remaining time information that is shown in the display assists in waiting for green.\nAudi has already completed the next development step, which goes beyond the project scope of simTD. Here, the cars are connected to the central traffic control computer via UMTS. This makes it unnecessary to convert the traffic lights themselves. 35 units of the Audi A1 e-tron, which are participating in the “Showcase for Electric Mobility” initiative by the German federal government, already utilize an advanced version of this new technology.\nTraffic light info online enables CO2 reductions of up to 15 percent.

Today, Audi is already seeing a lot of interest among cities and communities.\nIn the simTD large-scale test study, initiated in autumn 2008, six German carmakers, two large suppliers, a communications company and several scientific and public institutes are working closely together to acquire comprehensive knowledge about Car-to-X communication. The project was sponsored by the German federal ministries for Economy and Technology, Education and Research and Transport, Building and Urban Development.\nOver the course of the six-month practical phase, after which the project has now come to an end, the total of 500 test drivers in 120 cars and three motorcycles covered a total of 1.65 million kilometers (1.03 million miles).

{"id": "2439", "text": "Chainsaw is a useful tool that comes in handy more often than not. If its repeated need has made you decide to buy one yourself or you are simply new to its usage, we suggest you to first read, watch, learn and only then, start using it. To find the ideal chainsaw, take a look at this handy guide from the unclutterer that will help you to choose the one for your needs. Because anything that can cut, whether it be a power saw or even a simple steak knife, can be dangerous. It is not our purpose to scare you, we simply want to make you aware of its safety measures. So, here are some chainsaw safety tips to follow.\n1. Read the Manual\nManuals are carefully put together after much deliberation by the company’s professionals and experts to ensure your safety, not for you to toss it into the black hole. Not just chainsaw, anything you buy that has a manual, go through it at least once, it’ll only take a few minutes. Who knows, it might save you from getting injured and even from life threatening situations one day. Start small on logs and precut trees of smaller size. Get yourself acquainted with everything related to a chainsaw at chain cutting.\n2. First Watch and Learn\nDo not touch a chainsaw if you’ve not seen someone working with it before. It’s important to first watch how the tool works, what all needs to be done, how should one hold, handle and work with it. If you do not personally know someone who works with the tool, get help from a professional for the first few works. Watch closely as they operate the machine and also ask them for tips and tricks because they know what can go wrong and how. After that start practicing in their supervision.\n3. Know Your Machine\nIt is always fruitful to know your machine, it’s parts, functioning, uses and also, the limitations. It’s even better to buy a chainsaw after you’ve gone through some considerations like your requirement, size of the chainsaw and its usage. Examine the machine for any loose bolts or parts before every use. It’s maintenance is highly essential, oil the holes, maintain the sharpness of the chain, keep the air filters and chain brake mechanism free from sawdust. Follow the manual for maintenance instructions and always use genuine replacement parts. Get regular servicing at a service center.\n4. Wear Safety Gear\nNo safety gear, no working with the chainsaw. Follow this rule and you’ll always be inside the safe zone. Safety gear for using a chainsaw includes safety glasses to protect the eyes, helmet for your priceless head, headphones, so the noise does not affect your hearing ability. Gloves are also necessary for good grip, handling a chainsaw with damp hands is highly dangerous. Also be properly dressed for the task at hand, wear full sleeve clothes, chaps and a well-built pair of boots. Do not compromise with the boots, get the best one. You’ll know why.\n5. Miscellaneous Steps\nBesides all the written rules and instructions, there are other miscellaneous steps that you can take for extra safety. Because accidents do not follow the rules, do they? Kickback is a common concept and you have to be extra attentive to prevent it. Avoid cutting above shoulder height. Keep a well-equipped first aid box handy. Do not cut if you’re completely alone at the work sight. Do not start felling trees if you’re not experienced enough. Be patient, do not rush with this machine. Watching online tutorial videos will also pay off.Chainsaw accidents are very common, not because they are highly dangerous but because people don’t take safety seriously considering it an easily operable machine. But we should always remember that safety comes first and we should never compromise with it. Don’t try to be superman, because a real hero is the one who lives by the rules.", "scores": {"score": 3, "score_transform_1": 5, "score_transform_2": 5, "score_transform_3": 0}}

{"id": "2497", "text": "Looney Tunables: PoC Available for LPE Vulnerability Impacting Major Linux Distributions (CVE-2023-4911)\n[Update] November 22, 2023: See the subheading: “CISA Adds Looney Tunables Vulnerability (CVE-2023-4911) to KEV Catalog: Patching Required by December 12.”\n[Update] November 15, 2023: See the subheading: “Scan for the Looney Tunables Vulnerability (CVE-2023-4911): A Nuclei Template is Available.”\n[Update] November 7, 2023: See the subheading: “Kinsing Exploits Looney Tunables (CVE-2023-4911) Vulnerability to Steal Credentials and Secrets from AWS Environments.”\nResearchers have released a Proof-of-Concept (PoC) exploit for a new high-severity vulnerability, dubbed ‘Looney Tunables,’ which impacts the majority of well-known Linux distributions. This vulnerability allows attackers to execute local privilege escalation (LPE) and acquire complete root privileges.\nExploitation of this vulnerability presents a significant risk, as it could lead to potential data breaches, system alterations, and the complete takeover of vulnerable systems.\nWhat is the ‘Looney Tunables’ Vulnerability About? (CVE-2023-4911)\nThe vulnerability, identified as CVE-2023-4911 (CVSS score: 7.8, High), is a buffer overflow issue in the GNU C Library’s – commonly known as glibc – ld.so dynamic loader. The vulnerability was introduced into the code in April 2021 with the release of glibc 2.34, and recently, researchers have released a Proof-of-Concept (PoC) exploit for it, underscoring the urgency of patching.\nCVE-2023-4911 resides in the dynamic loader’s handling of the GLIBC_TUNABLES environment variable. According to Red Hat, a local cybercriminal can manipulate this vulnerability through maliciously crafted GLIBC_TUNABLES environment variables. This allows them to launch binaries with SUID permissions and execute code with elevated privileges.\nWhy is the Vulnerability So Important?\nThe glibc library within Linux systems is foundational, offering critical functionalities such as open, read, write, malloc, and more. Particularly, the dynamic loader embedded in the library holds immense significance, as it manages the preparation and execution of programs on Linux systems utilizing glibc.\nGLIBC_TUNABLES is of great value for developers and system administrators to optimize applications in sync with glibc — the environment variable was introduced in glibc to allow users to dynamically adjust the library’s behavior. Exploitation of this feature, on the other hand, could have negative consequences, affecting system performance, reliability, and, most importantly, security.\nWhich Linux Distributions Are Affected by the Vulnerability?\nThe vulnerability impacts major Linux distributions, including:\n- Fedora 37 and 38\n- Ubuntu 22.04 and 23.04\n- Debian 12 and 13\nWhile certain distributions like Alpine Linux remain unaffected, many other distributions are still vulnerable to the Looney Tunables vulnerability, CVE-2023-4911.\nProof-of-Concept (PoC) Exploit for Looney Tunables Linux Vulnerability\nIt is explained in the PoC exploit for Looney Tunables that a particular buffer is created in the program’s code at line 284 using a function called “tunables_strdup().” This function is a re-implementation of another function called “strdup(),” but it is designed to work a little differently.\nInstead of using a standard memory allocation of glibc method called “malloc(),” strdup() uses a different one called “__minimal_malloc()” from ld.so. This __minimal_malloc() function, in turn, requests additional memory from the kernel using a function called “mmap().”\nThe release of a PoC exploit raises concerns, as it potentially invites threat actors who are eager to exploit the vulnerability. However, it also heightens awareness and underscores the importance of timely patching.\nKinsing Exploits Looney Tunables (CVE-2023-4911) Vulnerability to Steal Credentials and Secrets from AWS Environments\nA concerning shift in tactics has been observed as the Kinsing group exploits the Looney Tunables vulnerability, known as CVE-2023-4911, in attacks against cloud servers. Researchers initially raised the alarm regarding Kinsing’s manual exploitation efforts on November 3, marking the first documented instance of such an exploit, as per their findings.\nOnce the Kinsing attackers gain initial access through CVE-2017-9841 (Critical PHPUnit vulnerability, CVSS: 9.8), they establish a reverse shell on port 1337. Then, they use manually crafted shell commands to identify and exploit the Looney Tunables vulnerability, enabling privilege escalation, and the theft of credentials and secrets.\nResearchers state that the data that could be stolen in a successful attack includes temporary security credentials, IAM role credentials, and instance identity tokens, each with significant implications for AWS resources and interactions with other AWS services.\nWhat is on the Horizon?\nThe Kinsing group is known for cryptojacking and typically targets cloud-native environments like Kubernetes clusters, Docker API, Redis servers, Jenkins servers, and more. In their usual attacks, they gain initial access by exploiting recent vulnerabilities and cloud misconfigurations before launching fully automated attacks.\nKinsing’s new approach of manually probing for the CVE-2023-4911 vulnerability represents a departure from their typical methods, focusing on more customized attacks tailored to cloud-native environments. This, in turn, heightens concerns regarding the threat posed by the Looney Tunables vulnerability; more varied and intense activities may be on the horizon, necessitating immediate action from cloud security teams and administrators.\nScan for the Looney Tunables Vulnerability (CVE-2023-4911): A Nuclei Template is Available\nYou can use the Nuclei scanner to detect the Looney Tunables vulnerability (CVE-2023-4911). A dedicated Nuclei template for CVE-2023-4911 is accessible on ProjectDiscovery.\nCISA Adds Looney Tunables Vulnerability (CVE-2023-4911) to KEV Catalog: Patching Required by December 12\nCISA has incorporated the actively exploited Looney Tunables vulnerability in the Linux GNU C library into its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog.\nThe agency emphasizes that these types of vulnerabilities serve as common targets for malicious cyber actors, posing substantial risks to the federal enterprise.\nWith multiple Proof-of-Concept exploits detected in the wild and documented exploitation by known threat actors, swift patching is crucial to prevent further attacks.\nCISA has set the due date for private organizations and federal agencies to address this vulnerability as December 12, 2023.\nEnhance Vulnerability Management with SOCRadar’s Threat Intelligence\nAs Linux users and administrators, staying informed, keeping your systems current, and remaining vigilant are all essential in navigating the ever-changing landscape of cybersecurity threats.\nSOCRadar’s threat intelligence assists organizations in staying updated on the latest vulnerabilities and risks.

Yet, I must say that we should correct press releases and usually try to give useful information about how to write better, in the hope that our tips and articles will help improve your English writing skills, consequently leading to greater software sales.\nWe’ve already written an article on the rules that are generally recommended while writing the text of a press release, but now I want to draw your attention to the concepts of writing clearly and understandably in the English language.\nWrite in a more understandable way and choose simpler words to express the main idea.\nUse a simpler word whenever you can. Replacing complex words with simpler words wherever possible lets your readers concentrate on your ideas and information.\nYour press release should be easy for the average person to understand, without having to pull out the dictionary. Don't add unnecessary complexity, and don't assume that the reader knows industry jargon or slang. Keep it simple.\nThe use of unfamiliar or complex terms interferes with comprehension and slows readers down. Readers may even skip terms they don’t understand, hoping to find their meanings within the context of the rest of the sentence.\nUse shorter, simpler words as the basis of your writing and save longer or complex words for when they are essential. As the writer, you control how specific your information is. The further you move away from the use of abstract words, and towards specific ones, the clearer and more precise your message becomes.\nUse everyday words and phrases. This is important. Use the language of everyday speech, for example, the terms: \"so, do, get, make, and build”, rather than “develop, obtain, maximize, and construct.\"\nHere is a list of some other complex terms and their simpler alternatives:\nAdvantageous — helpful;\nAccompany – go with;\nAccurate - correct, exact, right;\nAdditional – more;\nApproximate - about;\nCommence — begin, start;\nConsolidate — combine;\nDeleterious — harmful;\nDemonstrate - prove, show;\nDetermine - decide, figure, find;\nEndeavor — try;\nErroneous — wrong;\nExpeditious — fast;\nElect - choose, pick;\nFrequently – often;\nFacilitate — ease, help;\nInception — start;\nImplement — carry out;\nImmediately - at once;\nLeverage — use;\nMaintain - keep, support;\nOptimize — perfect;\nPrescribed — required;\nProficiencies — skills;\nPromulgate — issue or publish;\nProximity — near;\nRegarding — about;\nRelocate – move;\nRemain - stay;\nPurchase - buy;\nRemuneration — reward, payment;\nSubsequently — after or later.\nRegardless of whether English is your first or second language, these guidelines can help enhance the structure, flow and clarity of your writing, thus improving your sales in Western and American software markets.\n\"I try to use simpler words in my own writing, doing so is not always possible. Sometimes I need a complex word to communicate a more precise meaning. Other times, complex words cannot be avoided due to the subject matter. As a general rule, I use simpler words as the basis of my writing and save the more complex words for when they’re absolutely necessary—or if I’m trying to impress another editor.\"\nLaura Hale Brockway is the author of the grammar/usage/random thoughts blog:\n\"From my experience, people will often use the more complex word to impress or because they operate in a work culture where these words are commonly used. As a former journalist who is now a media adviser I do not like them when communicating to a mass audience as they exclude audience and send an implicit message that the author is incapable of or unwilling to speak in plain English.\"", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}
{"id": "2505", "text": "ORANGE COUNTY, N.C. – This year, 27 states have raised or will raise their minimum wage, but North Carolina isn’t one of them. The state’s minimum wage is $7.25 and it’s been the same for 14 years.\nIt matches the federal minimum wage put into law in 2009. But after all that time, many are asking whether it's still enough.\nWhat You Need To Know\n- This year, 27 states have raised or will raise their minimum wages but North Carolina’s is still $7.25\n- North Carolina’s minimum wage hasn’t changed in 14 years and it matches the federal minimum wage put into law in 2009\n- An Orange County nonprofit say this year’s living wage is either $16.60 or $15.10, depending on whether the employer provides health insurance\n- The owners of Big Spoon Roasters in Hillsborough are certified by the nonprofit because they pay a living wage\nThe Orange County Living Wage is a volunteer driven nonprofit. The organization calculated that a living wage in the county this year is $16.60 an hour if an employer doesn’t provide health insurance. However, if an employer does provide health insurance, it’s $15.10. That’s more than double the federal and state minimum wage.\nThe owners of Big Spoon Roasters in Hillsborough have decided to pay their employees more than the minimum wage.\n“Big Spoon Roasters was founded in 2011. We make fresh roasted nut butters and bars that are made with our nut butters. So that's everything from peanut butters and almond butters to cashew butters,” Megan Overbay, the co-founder of Big Spoon Roasters, said.\nBig Spoon Roasters started as a home-based business.\n“Eleven, 12 years later, and we are in 800 different retailers across the country. We are have a great e-commerce business. We sell on our own website as well as through Amazon,” Overbay said.\nMegan Overbay's partner in business and life, as she says, is her husband Mark Overbay.\n“When we started this business, we had this dream of starting the kind of business where we would always want to work ourselves,” Mark Overbay, co-founder of Big Spoon Roasters, said.\nPart of that means taking care of all the people who help make Big Spoon Roasters what it is.\n“Throughout sourcing ingredients, packaging, how you sell - you have to build into your model, taking care of the human beings that make your business possible. If that model does not make that possible, then it's a flawed model,” Mark Overbay said. “I think the state minimum wage hasn't been updated since 2009 and it's still at $7.25 an hour and that's way below a living standard for anyone in this community.”\nFor the Overbays, that involves increasing pay for their team members.\n“The state living wage was set in 2009 at $7.25 an hour. Just a few years ago, for Big Spoon, we were paying starting people at $14 an hour. That went up to $15 an hour. And we're actually really excited in the next couple of weeks to raise again,” Megan Overbay said. \"We have 16 team members right now. Two of them are part time and the others are almost full time. There are a couple people that work a reduced schedule, but anyone who works over 20 hours a week gets benefits with us. They get pro-rated benefits for whatever their regular schedule is.\"\nBig Spoon Roasters is one of 268 businesses certified by The Orange County Living Wage nonprofit, an organization that calculates a living wage based on the year’s average Fair Market Rent for a one-bedroom apartment.\n“We think everyone should be able to live comfortably and feel safe and that you shouldn't have to work multiple jobs to be able to just make ends meet,” Megan Overbay said.\nThe Overbays believe paying a living wage is part of a positive ripple effect that has allowed their business and community to thrive.\n“If you don't worry about whether or not you're going to [have] food on the table and if you're going to have medical support, if you have a health issue or if you're not worried about having a roof over your head, then you're going to come to work and you're going to be happier and excited to be there and thankful. And those are the kinds of things you want people to do. You want them to be healthy and happy at work as well as at home,” Megan Overbay said.\nFor comparison, the wage calculated by The Orange County Living Wage is higher than any other state’s current minimum wage. According to the Department of Labor, the state with the highest minimum wage right now is Washington at $15.74 an hour.\nThe Overbays say one way people can help support the living wage movement is by recognizing that it matters where you spend your money. Try to research businesses before you buy from them to learn how they treat their employees.", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}
{"id": "2515", "text": "Just before the sun rose on the sleeping city of Jerusalem, that original Easter Sunday morning, a group of tired guards paced in front of a large boulder that hid the tomb of Jesus. It was in that half light time and their inner chemistry would then have been telling them that the new day was upon them. The Bible says that suddenly an angel of the Lord appeared with amazing whiteness and this awesome figure rolled that great two ton boulder away and then sat there on it in terrifying light. The guards fell to the ground paralysed and unconscious with fear. But the angel did not roll the stone away to let the Lord Jesus out for he was already gone. The Easter Miracle of Christ’s actual resurrection happened without any human observation. The angel rolled the stone away to let the people then, and all of humanity now, look in on an empty tomb. Easter is about our taking the occasion to look in on the greatest miracle of all time. That is why you are here worshipping today.\nWhy is Easter remembering the greatest miracle of all time? Firstly because it is about the greatest Person of all time. Jesus only is the God-man. He was the eternal Son of God who added on humanity and came from eternity to be born as a man. He was fully human without that meaning he was any less divine. There has never been and never will be another equal. In the centre of history the greatest miracle has been performed by the greatest person.\nSecondly, Easter is about this God-man doing something beyond both God and man before He came. Jesus achieved that which He could not do while He was only divine. In Heaven before He came, the eternal Son of God could not die and so also could not be the subject of the resurrection. He voluntarily took on humanity to be the fitting, sinless and perfect, sacrifice for our sins. And so He died for us…That death earned our forgiveness. Then God the Father raised Him (Jesus, the God-man) to life again. The tomb was empty because it was a bodily resurrection. It was the raising of the body of Jesus out of the tomb never to die again. It was the first lifting of our humanity to be totally immortal and the other side of death. There had been other resuscitations, but this was the first resurrection. It took God to be in a man for that God-man to beat death.\nThis has been the greatest action of all history. When Jesus rose again He made available a new humanity to offer to you and to me. We don’t have to be locked in to the old man that always fails in sin. Now we have a new humanity in the God-man Christ.\nWhen to come by faith to Jesus, God gives us a new “human nature transplant” whereby our connection to the fallen Adam is cancelled and we are aligned with, connected to and recreated in the new man Christ.\nThat is why the Bible says:\n[box]If any person be in Christ he is a new creation. Old things are passed away. Behold, all things have become new!”\n2 Corinthians 5: 17 [/box]\nThe making available of this new humanity to us all was achieved by Jesus coming to life again.\nPraise Him. Worship Him. Trust Him.\nJim GibsonThank Sri 🙂", "scores": {"score": 3, "score_transform_1": 5, "score_transform_2": 5, "score_transform_3": 0}}
{"id": "2516", "text": "Built-for-Life Bootstrapper Bill Flagg Zings on ZingTrain\nIf you met Bill Flagg, you wouldn’t be surprised that an interview with Bill Flagg doesn’t quite go like a traditional interview might. Bill will ask as many questions as he answers. His are usually the thought-provoking kind that are meant to teach you something. Bill will answer questions you didn’t ask, not directly anyway. And Bill will extemporize on the topic he thinks you should be talking to him about rather than the one you’d decided on, but it’s such interesting stuff that you feel fine with letting go of your agenda and just running with it.\nBill is a wiry, compact man with a lot of happy energy. He isn’t buzzing with it, but you wouldn’t be able to be dour around him. He told me something from his wild, single days that made me laugh out loud and also characterized him perfectly. Bill would walk up to women and ask them “What do you have going for you besides your good looks?” I think he does the same thing now—but with CEOs, not women!\nBill Flagg’s company is called The Felix Fun! It used to be The Felix Fund until he attended The Zingerman’s Experience seminar and dropped the D. That’s Bill for you.\nBill was the co-owner of RegOnline, which he sold to The Active Network in 2007. He hopes to never sell another great company. In 2008, Bill started The Felix Fun to be an angel partner in helping other entrepreneurs grow great companies and thrive through organic growth. His four Felix Fun companies collectively have approximately 100 coworkers, $15 million in revenue, 25% profitability and are growing 20% per year. When he describes the kind of companies he wants to invest in, Bill uses the tag line – ‘Built for Life’. I want to change it to ‘Bill-ed for Life!’\nBill Flagg now lives in Boulder, Colorado, but he first encountered Zingerman’s as a student at the University of Michigan. Bill is a huge fan of Zingerman’s in the most intellectual way. The food isn’t irrelevant; he does have a weakness for Landjaegers, amongst other things. It’s just that he really, really gets off on good ideas. Which is all to say that interviewing Bill Flagg turned out to be more of a conversation than a question and answer session. I’ll report it to the best of my ability but do excuse the variety of reporting voices and styles – it was the only way I could really capture the conversation.\nWhat made Bill look beyond the food at Zingerman’s:\nBill describes an experience on the Zingerman’s Deli floor. The staff member offered him a taste of a 100 year old, $500 a bottle balsamic vinegar. Bill demurred. “There is no way I’m going to buy that,” he said. The staff member insisted. With an energy and enthusiasm that Bill noted with some amazement, the staff member said, “Just taste it. I want you to have this experience. That’s all.” What Bill realized then was that this guy truly “got” Zingerman’s mission. That impressed him and, Bill being Bill, he decided to find out more.\n“I had come as a curious skeptic. There are a lot of similarities between the Felix Fun and Zingerman’s: unique and diverse businesses, organic growth, entrepreneurial, boot-strapped and planning on sticking around, not built to flip. But you all were much bigger and had stuck around for 30 years. Plus your practices have a good bit of credibility in the business world. I was impressed. I was also a little skeptical—were these people really going to share their ‘secret sauce’ with me?\n“But you guys just roll it all out there. You’re not worried about competitors. You’re not putting on a public face. There was such a feeling of open-ness about everything—the seminar material, the tours of the businesses, the staff panel. As a seminar attendee, I did not feel like an audience-member, I felt like a participant. And you guys let me poke around anywhere! There are not too many companies out there that are this naturally open. For me, The Zingerman’s Experience seminar was like a gateway drug!\n“What I particularly loved is that The Zingerman’s Experience seminar is not for people who are looking for recipes and techniques for problem-solving. It is a framework for building a great business.“\nOn why Bill and the Felix Fun CEOs are so drawn to ZingTrain:\nBill, and by extension the partners he chooses to work with, have similar values in some ways: they want their businesses to grow organically, they don’t want to eventually flip the businesses for money, they think about their businesses in terms of organizational culture and long-term value. And they are huge fans of continuous learning and personal growth.\nBill quotes John Mackey, co-founder of Whole Foods, who credits the growth of Whole Foods to his personal growth, because the organization follows.\n“Some people are built for learning,” Bill says. “We’re like that. In fact, we are your target customer.\n“We’re excited about ZingTrain because you provide us with a framework on which to improve our businesses. All businesses face motivation and drama issues. What Zingerman’s is doing is providing a framework that takes the drama away because the employees feel empowered and complain less because the responsibility to act is shared across all levels of the organization in an Open Book business.\n“ZingTrain is more comprehensive than any books, workshops or seminars I’ve encountered. A lot of people do a great job in one particular dimension of the business world—Danny Meyer on Hospitality, The Great Game of Business on Open Book Management—but ZingTrain is totally comprehensive. It lays out the entire framework for building a great business—Visioning, Open Book Management, Customer Service. When we sit in your seminars, we’re just bouncing off the ceiling with the ideas that you are inspiring. This is the biggest value I have ever seen!”\nAnd here, Bill began to extemporize about ZingTrain:\n“If you ask me—ZingTrain is best for smaller to mid-size businesses with 1-2 million dollars in revenue. Or to put it another way, ZingTrain is best for businesses that have leaders who can implement change quickly.\n“ZingTrain’s true value is to entrepreneurs who want to deliver an experience, not just maximize profits, but don’t want it to all be on their shoulders. You show us how to do it.\n“In fact, now that I think about it—there should be an application process for your seminars! You should ask people who want to attend to write a vision about what they want to get out of the seminar and how they’ll use it and then you can pick and choose who attends!”\nWe’re not about to create an application process for ZingTrain seminars, but thanks for yet another great conversation, Bill!", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}
{"id": "2521", "text": "David Schwimmer, best known as Ross Geller from the famous TV show “Friends,” has been the talk of the town regarding possible plastic surgery. This article looks into the rumors about whether he’s had any cosmetic work done.\nDavid Schwimmer is a well-known actor, director, and producer from America. He became really popular for his role in “Friends,” where he played Ross Geller. This role brought him a lot of praise and even a nomination for a big award. After “Friends” ended, Schwimmer didn’t just sit back; he kept busy with different kinds of acting jobs, voice work, and even directing.\nThere’s been a lot of chatter about whether David Schwimmer has had plastic surgery. People have been looking closely at his pictures from the past and now, and they think they see some changes in how he looks. These changes are mostly about his nose and skin, which some believe might be due to surgeries like a nose job or treatments to make his skin look smoother.\nIn short, while there’s no solid proof or word from Schwimmer himself about any surgery, the differences in how he looks over time have made people wonder. But no matter what, it’s his acting skills and roles that really make him stand out.\nWho is David Schwimmer?\nDavid Schwimmer is an American actor, director, and producer, best known for his role as Ross Geller on the popular television sitcom “Friends.” Born on November 2, 1966, in Queens, New York, Schwimmer rose to fame in the 1990s thanks to his portrayal of the lovable paleontologist Ross Geller, a role that earned him worldwide recognition and a Primetime Emmy Award nomination.\nBefore his breakout role in “Friends,” Schwimmer had various television roles and was a co-founder of the Lookingglass Theatre Company in Chicago. His background in theater contributed significantly to his acting career. After “Friends” concluded in 2004, Schwimmer continued to work in film, television, and theater.\nHe appeared in several films, lent his voice to the character of Melman in the “Madagascar” animated film series, and directed movies like “Run Fatboy Run.”\nIn addition to his work in entertainment, Schwimmer has been involved in advocacy, particularly focusing on issues of sexual harassment and violence.

During this time, he had a youthful, fresh-faced look typical of young actors starting in the industry.\n- During “Friends” (1994-2004): Schwimmer’s role as Ross Geller brought him into the limelight. Over the show’s ten seasons, viewers could see subtle changes as he matured from a young adult into a more seasoned actor. His hairstyle, fashion choices, and overall demeanor evolved with the character and the times.\n- Post-Friends Career: After “Friends” ended, Schwimmer continued to work in film, television, and theater.

Some speculated about possible cosmetic procedures due to changes in his facial features, but these remain unconfirmed.\nIn conclusion, while there is no concrete evidence or confirmation from Schwimmer himself about undergoing plastic surgery, the changes in his appearance have led to widespread speculation. Regardless of these rumors, Schwimmer’s talent and contributions to the entertainment industry remain his defining attributes.\nWhat is the main speculation regarding David Schwimmer’s plastic surgery?\nDavid Schwimmer is speculated to have undergone plastic surgery, including rhinoplasty and Botox, based on changes observed in his facial features over the years.\nHas David Schwimmer confirmed undergoing plastic surgery?\nNo, David Schwimmer has not publicly confirmed undergoing any plastic surgery.\nWhy do people think David Schwimmer had plastic surgery?\nPeople speculate about David Schwimmer’s plastic surgery due to noticeable changes in his facial features, particularly his nose and the smoothness of his forehead.\nWhat are the rumored procedures David Schwimmer might have had?\nRumored procedures include rhinoplasty (nose job) and Botox injections.\nHow has David Schwimmer’s appearance changed over the years?\nSchwimmer’s appearance has changed with a seemingly slimmer nose and smoother forehead, leading to plastic surgery speculations.\nWhat impact has the speculation about plastic surgery had on David Schwimmer’s public image?\nDavid Schwimmer’s public image remains largely defined by his acting talent and iconic roles.\nIs plastic surgery common among celebrities like David Schwimmer?\nYes, plastic surgery is relatively common in the entertainment industry.

{"id": "2547", "text": "Title: CompleteView Web and Mobile Client Connection Failure\nDescription: Web and mobile clients are unable to authenticate with a CompleteView 7.X deployment and are consequently unable to receive live or recorded video.\nDuring installation and initial configuration, the CompleteView Management Server creates a self-signed security certificate which allows for authentication of remote clients (web and mobile). The certificate is valid for one year from creation. When the certificate expires, the remote clients are no longer able to authenticate with the deployment’s Recording Servers and therefore unable to receive live or recorded video. Note that this certificate is automatically created by all CompleteView deployments and is separate from any certificates created by the user, such as those used for TLS communication. Consequently, this issue affects all CompleteView 7.X+ Management Servers.\nTo allow remote clients to authenticate and reconnect, a new security certificate must be created. A new security certificate is created by restarting the CompleteView Management Server Windows Service after the expiration of the existing certificate.\nAfter the service has been restarted on the Management Server, a configuration save is required on each of the deployment’s Recording Servers, done by clicking the Save to Server (disk) icon in the Configure module of the Desktop Client.\nThe Desktop Client authenticates in a different manner and is unaffected by the expiration of the certificate.\n- CompleteView 7.X Management Server\n- CompleteView Web Client\n- CompleteView iOS Client\nCompleteView Desktop Client\nAs described above, restart the CompleteView Management Server Windows service after the expiration of the current certificate to generate a new one, then perform a configuration save on the deployment’s Recording Servers.\nThe expiration date of the current certificate can be seen via the Start menu.

{"id": "2553", "text": "Swarthmore’s freshman retention rate is the stuff of college-rankings legends. A whopping 96 percent of students return to the school after their freshman year, a number which, according to publications such as the US News and World Report, is “an indicator of student satisfaction.” But is it really?\nLike many of the clunky metrics used to formulate college rankings, the freshman retention rate fails to account for a number of factors. Though most students return to the college after their freshman year, only 88 percent complete their Swarthmore education within four years, according to the college’s website. What about the other 12 percent, who take time off?\nStudents may choose to take time away from Swarthmore for any number of reasons, including physical or mental health. In these cases, students such as Mark Gardiner* ’15 and Adan Leon ’17 said, returning was a relatively simple process.\nGardiner, originally a member of the class of 2014, returned to Swarthmore for the fall of his sophomore year despite orders from his doctor to stay home due to a severe case of mononucleosis. He only made it through a month of the fall semester before he grew so ill that he was hospitalized for several months. When he recovered, Gardiner got a job at a solar lobbying firm in California.\nEnjoying his job and using his time off to begin a startup with a friend from another college, Gardiner extended his break from a semester to a year. When he did return, the process was smooth, he said: he told the school what he had been up to in his time off, and was accepted back easily. Swarthmore, Gardiner said, simply wanted to ensure that he could keep up with academic demands upon his return, which was easy to demonstrate since he had been so busy during his time away.\nLeon, meanwhile, elected to take the spring of 2015 off from Swarthmore due to a series of academic struggles caused by health issues. Leon felt he was not taking care of himself, either physically or mentally. By the end of the fall semester, he had taken two incompletes and dropped one of his classes.\n“I was just dying,” Leon said. “I was just like, I need to figure this out, it’s affecting me badly and I can’t get my life together…I had a really rough fall semester trying to figure out a bunch of stuff out and I realized that you can’t really figure out your life and be at Swarthmore at the same time.”\nLeon believes that his return process — which he said was simply a matter of speaking to Associate Dean of Academic Affairs Diane Anderson and completing a series of steps demonstrating that he was ready to meet the college’s academic requirements — was made easier by the fact that he had taken the time off before he could be placed on academic probation.\nOther students — such as Frank Rizzo ’17, who was asked to leave by the college after failing to meet academic requirements — may have a more difficult time returning. Rizzo intended to return after one semester, but ended up spending a year away from the college.\nDuring his sophomore year, Rizzo failed to complete several of his classes. After the spring semester, the school asked him to turn in his missing work by July 1. When he did not meet the deadline, Rizzo received an email from Assistant Dean for Academic Affairs Liz Derickson ’01 on behalf of the Committee on Academic Requirements. (The committee of faculty members meets at the end of each semester to review the records of students who have been struggling academically, and issues warnings, places students on academic probation, or requires students to “stay away for a semester or longer and engage in meaningful activity: classes, work, or volunteer activities,” according to the college handbook and Derickson.)\nThe email informed Rizzo that he would be required to take the semester off.\n“That came as a shock because I hadn’t realized it was going to escalate that quickly,” Rizzo said, though he added that if he had been in more constant contact with Derickson, rather than simply ignoring the one or two warning emails he had received beforehand, the letter’s shock value would have decreased.\nRizzo said that the college then informed him of what he had to do in order to return for the spring semester and told him to contact his professors. But Rizzo had difficulty, he said, getting himself to begin the return process.\n“It wasn’t like the Dean’s Office was checking in to see how I was doing or anything,” he said. “They left the door open, but it’s kind of hard to step into that door when you’re feeling bad about how you’ve handled things and you’re unsure about how to proceed.”\nDuring his first semester away, Rizzo took several classes in his hometown of Los Angeles, and he worked on his incomplete papers until he was offered an internship at a publishing company in New York. Completing his work, however, was difficult outside of an academic environment. Rizzo’s experience highlights the alienating aspect of forced time off, and how being asked to stay away from Swarthmore might create more obstacles to a successful return.\nRizzo says he initially cut off all contact with Swarthmore students, deleted his Facebook, and stopped checking his Swatmail.\n“I wanted to remove myself from it entirely. I didn’t want to know what was going on at school.” These feelings of isolation made it easier for Rizzo to put his academic work out of his head, and that winter he missed the second deadline the school set for him. After a few months living “quote-unquote in the real world,” Rizzo did gain enough focus to meet the third deadline, enabling his return this fall.\nRegardless of whether they left the college voluntarily or were asked to do so, students can have a difficult time coming to terms with the idea of taking time off.\nGardiner, for instance, worked so hard to remain at Swarthmore that he lost almost seventy pounds due to his illness, despite clearly being too sick to continue taking classes.\n“I was driving myself crazy, telling myself I should stay, when I really needed to go,” Gardiner said. Only when he was unable to leave bed to attend classes and extremely serious medical complications began did he admit that he needed time to rest and recover.\n“I thought, ‘Once you’re in college, you’re in college,’” Gardiner said. “You think, four years, not five. It felt like I was derailing a bit.”\nFortunately, Gardiner found support when he came back in the form of others’ stories.\n“I’ve never met more people in my life that have been okay with the idea of pausing and taking time off,” Gardiner said. “It was kind of a culture shock to me… but when I talked to people who had been in similar situations with health issues… there were so many examples, it was kind of crazy, and so it made me feel a lot less bad about leaving.”\nStudents interviewed for this article also said that, in their experience, the college does its best to support those who are struggling academically or otherwise, and to smooth the process of return for those who wish to come back.\nWhen students are struggling in classes, Derickson said, professors will sometimes refer them to class deans, academic deans, or other members of the deans’ staff.\n“We work with students to try to figure out the root of their academic struggles and to help them connect to various resources on campus,” Derickson said. These resources, she said, include Student Academic Mentors, the Office of Learning Resources, professors, tutors, Counseling and Psychological Services, and the Writing Associate Program, among others.\nRizzo, for instance, met with Derickson and Coordinator of Student Disability Services Leslie Hempling before his academic problems even began, in his sophomore fall. But though Rizzo acknowledges that the deans were supportive, he found it difficult to take advantage of this support, which he attributed in part to the competitive environment at the college. Struggling academically was, for Rizzo, characterized by shame, as all of his classmates appeared to be enjoying great academic success.\n“What would have made it a little bit better was if people talked about having trouble with their work more,” Rizzo said. “When you’re drowning in work, you feel alone, and when you feel alone you don’t want to talk about it with anyone. You feel like you’re the only one who might have to take time off… you don’t want to tell people how you’re doing, so that’s kind of how I approached the dean’s office, which wasn’t fair to them.”\nUpon returning to Swarthmore, students can face both social and academic challenges.\nFor Gardiner, transitioning back was easy academically, especially because he had been working in his time off. His re-entrance was more difficult socially, he said, as it seemed his graduating class had moved on without him.\nFor his part, Rizzo is both worried and excited about the prospect of returning.\n“I’m really nervous — I haven’t been in school in a year. Working a nine-to-five job is very challenging, but in a different way… there’s a lot of pressure but it’s not the same thing as at school. I’m kind of glad to be done with it and looking forward to the more steady pressure of being at school.”\nRizzo noted that he was unsure about how he would deal with the issues of attitude and anxiety which had affected his academic performance in the past upon his return.\n“I wrote in my readmission letter that I would try to see a counselor when I came back, but I don’t know how realistic that is,” he said. “The chances that I will have the motivation to do that are actually not that great.”\nDerickson emphasized that her office works hard to help students who return from time off. “We work with returning students to develop promising academic plans and solid plans to tend to their well-being,” she said. She added that students who return from time off are encouraged to meet regularly with a dean and take advantage of the college’s other resources, and that there are organized meals and discussions among students who have returned from leaves of absence so that they can meet one another and share reflections with others considering time off.\nOther students may decide, after time off, that in fact they do not want to return, such as Rafi Ellenson, who began as a member of the class of 2016. Ellenson took his spring semester of freshman year off, returned for the following fall, and then took that spring off as well. This fall, he formally withdrew and enrolled at City College of New York. Ellenson felt that his mental health issues prohibited him from continuing his Swarthmore education, but that the problems he had would have taken place anywhere, not just at the college. Similarly to other students, Ellenson emphasized that Anderson and the rest of the college’s administration and faculty were helpful and supportive throughout his experience.\nAcross the board, students interviewed for this article were ultimately glad they had taken time off, and said they had gained physical and mental health, valuable real-world experience, and insight into themselves, whether intellectually or on a more personal level.\n“As trite as it sounds now, I have zero regrets about taking time off,” Gardiner said. “It was a really good decision in the end.”\n*Note: This student’s name has been changed to ensure his privacy.", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

AP Photo/John Minchillo\nBrooklyn’s population has not reached pre-Covid levels as quickly as Manhattan’s, but in terms of the number of visits by American tourists, Brooklyn is leaving Manhattan far behind.\nAt least, that’s the word from Place.ai (Placer Lab), a California-based analytics firm that describes itself as “providing location analytics and performance data for businesses in commercial real estate, retail, hospitality and community”.\nPlacer, analyzing the change in retail traffic and domestic foot traffic in the two boroughs, found that “while Manhattan is struggling to maintain its pre-pandemic levels of domestic tourism, Brooklyn has seen domestic tourism increase year-over-year each month this year. “\nDomestic or non-foreign travel to Manhattan, according to the online report “Manhattan and Brooklyn’s Pandemic Recovery,” has been up and down in recent months — up in February, down in March, up slightly in April, then down. again in May and June.\nMeanwhile, the report states, “inbound tourism in Brooklyn skyrocketed between January 2022 and May 2022, with double-digit increases in foot traffic each month [relative to 2019].” Brooklyn visitation growth slowed in 2022, but was still 5 percent higher than in June 2019.\nOne of the reasons, one might suspect, is Brooklyn’s affordability. However, the firm says, another factor could be the fact that after the long lull in travel caused by COVID, former residents are returning to visit friends, shop and visit restaurants.\nIn addition, the number of hotels in the municipality has increased dramatically. In the late 1990s, when the New York Marriott opened on the Brooklyn Bridge, it was heralded as a major event. Now, there are many hotels, in Downtown Brooklyn, Williamsburg, Sunset Park and elsewhere.\nBrooklyn’s retail foot traffic, while it still has a ways to go, has also grown faster than Manhattan’s since the pandemic. In June 2022, for example, retail foot traffic in Brooklyn was 17 percent below June 2019, while in Manhattan it was a full 27 percent below 2019.\nIn terms of population growth, Manhattan is leading the way — “While Manhattan’s population has essentially returned to pre-pandemic levels, Brooklyn still has fewer residents than in 2019,” the report said. “Many of those who left the municipality during the first two years of COVID have not yet returned.”\nThe firm doesn’t have a clear answer as to why that is, but it did provide the interesting fact that most people who left Brooklyn moved nearby — Queens was the most common destination, with Manhattan a close second.\nThis refutes the idea, often discussed early in the COVID pandemic, that Brooklynites who had the means to do so were leaving en masse for the open spaces of Upstate New York, the Hamptons, Pennsylvania and beyond.", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}

{"id": "2565", "text": "Letter from a reader, on how to find Victor:\nMost recently I dated a man who I was apathetic about meeting because he didn’t meet my list. We clicked instantly and had dates that were a “blast” and as soon as I was ready to fall, he ran. A scared Lance afraid of who he could have been with me. He was no doubt intimidated by me, so I’m still learning how to make a man feel good about who he is and all that he has accomplished. As you know, for successful, intelligent women, this is no easy deal. How do you balance making a man feel good about being with you while impressing him with who you are so he wants to continue, and when/how do you stop impressing him? I knew, living in a blue-collar town that dating men local to me would be a challenge, but I gave it a shot anyway. He was “impressed” with me at first, but then he had to face questions like what could he do for me? I know the answers, but he’ll never get to hear them. It was my job to make him see how wonderful he was with me. I’m still wrestling with this and recently turned down a date with a man in a similar situation (less educated, less worldly, less credit, you get the idea…). I don’t take all the blame here as I do want a strong man, and he wasn’t, but I do want to make sure the next guy can’t resist me even if my list intimidates him.\nI meet this intimidated man one more time to exchange some things from our short, but intense, 2-week relationship. If you have any sage advice for this last opportunity, please do let me know. I’m leaning towards just being positive – happy and energetic, but unavailable (even though I am).\nYours, Maggie B\nMaggie B —\nGreat letter! Now, I’ve never met you, and I don’t have any idea what your dynamic is on a date with a man. But this much I noticed: you mention several times that men are intimidated by you: “He was no doubt intimidated by me.” And then they disappear. I am here to tell you that, unless you’re having a very thorough exit interview with these dudes, you don’t have access to that kind of information — especially if they disappear. He could have left because he lost his job, or his dog died, or the Steelers had a 4-game losing streak. Or because he thought you were mean. And it would still look the same.\nAnd when you say that they’re intimidated, you’re subtly putting the onus on them: “I’m fine — they’re just intimidated by my greatness.” I’d like to bring to your attention the hard undertone to that, and it could be the thing that sends the guys running. It’s also disempowering to you, because when the issue is on them, there’s nothing you can do about it. But if it’s on you, you can grow into the person that solves the problem. Responsibility is power.\nWhat I would encourage you to do is to err on the side of kindness. In fact, it’s much better to impress them with the expansiveness of your heart and the depth of your compassion than to do so with your accomplishments and intellect. Trust me — they’ll figure it out eventually that you’re whip-smart, and they will appreciate you for it.\nBut lead with love. Leave business of impressing to the guys — heck, we’ve been building pyramids, making fortunes and starting wars for thousands of years to impress women. If the women start trying to impress us, we’ll be as good as unemployed.\nSo just be nice to the guys. If you’re that one woman who’s being nice to them, they’re just grateful out of their minds. The more you’re attached to your ‘list’, the more these poor guys will be on the defensive, wondering, “How can I possibly measure up?”\nIt’s like you’re a food critic, and these poor guys are trying to make you a home-cooked meal. How can they win? So let the inner food critic go. Appreciate men for what they have, and accept their humble meal for what it is — real nourishment and a show of love. Otherwise, if their cooking goes unappreciated and you go hungry, who wins?\nSo let you be their big win. And, from a man to you, remember: there is nothing more attractive to a man than a woman’s vulnerability.\ngo get ’em", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

{"id": "2576", "text": "When it comes to enhancing the aesthetics and functionality of your Shutters Dorset, one often-overlooked but highly effective option is installing stylish shutters. Shutters not only add a touch of elegance to your property but also offer numerous practical benefits.\nIn this article, we will explore why shutters are an excellent choice for homeowners in Dorset and how they can transform your living spaces.\n1. Aesthetic Appeal\nOne of the most significant advantages of installing shutters is the instant boost they provide to your home’s aesthetic appeal. Shutters come in a wide range of styles, materials, and finishes, allowing you to choose the perfect fit for your property’s design and your personal preferences. Whether your home has a classic, traditional, or modern design, there are shutters that will complement it beautifully.\n2. Versatile Design Options\nShutters are incredibly versatile and can be customised to match your unique style. They are available in various designs, including full-height shutters, café style shutters, tier-on-tier shutters, and more. This versatility means you can find shutters that suit your specific needs and preferences, whether you want maximum privacy, full light control, or a combination of both.\n3. Light and Privacy Control\nOne of the key benefits of shutters is their ability to control both natural light and privacy. You can easily adjust the louvres to let in as much or as little light as you desire, ensuring your living spaces are always comfortable and well-lit. Additionally, shutters provide an effective barrier against prying eyes, giving you the privacy you need without compromising on style.\n4. Energy Efficiency\nShutters also contribute to your home’s energy efficiency. By providing an extra layer of insulation, shutters help regulate the temperature inside your home, keeping it cooler in the summer and warmer in the winter. This can lead to lower energy bills and a reduced carbon footprint, making shutters an environmentally friendly choice.\n5. Durability and Longevity\nInvesting in shutters is a wise decision in terms of durability. High-quality shutters are built to last, and many manufacturers offer warranties to back up their products. Unlike curtains or blinds, shutters are less prone to wear and tear, making them a long-term addition to your home.\n6. Easy Maintenance\nMaintaining shutters Dorset is a breeze compared to other window treatments. Regular dusting or a quick wipe with a damp cloth is usually all that’s required to keep them looking pristine. This ease of maintenance is especially appealing to busy homeowners who value convenience.\n7. Increased Property Value\nInstalling stylish shutters can significantly increase the value of your property in Dorset. Potential buyers are often drawn to homes that have well-maintained and attractive window treatments, making your investment in shutters a smart financial move.\n8. Tailored to Your Needs\nEvery homeowner has unique requirements when it comes to window coverings. Shutters can be customised to fit various window shapes and sizes, ensuring a perfect fit for your home. This tailored approach allows you to achieve the desired look and functionality for each window.\n9. Enhancing Curb Appeal\nShutters not only improve the interior of your home but also enhance its curb appeal. The visual impact of well-designed shutters can make your home stand out in the neighbourhood, creating a lasting impression on passersby.\n10. Local Expertise\nWhen considering installing shutters in Dorset, it’s essential to consult with local experts who understand the specific needs and preferences of the region. Local professionals can guide you through the selection process, ensuring you choose shutters that are well-suited to Dorset’s climate and architectural styles.\nIn conclusion, enhancing your home with stylish shutters in Dorset is a fantastic way to improve its aesthetics, increase energy efficiency, and boost its overall value. With a wide range of design options and the many practical benefits they offer, shutters are a worthwhile investment for any homeowner in Dorset. So, if you’re looking to transform your living spaces and add a touch of elegance to your home, consider installing shutters today. Your home will thank you for it.", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}
{"id": "2579", "text": "In the sea of software development, there are two broad currents: custom and off-the-shelf. As it is, these two branches do not compete but rather complement one another by addressing separate market niches. Still, in this article, we will mostly concentrate on the custom division of software development, as well as the gap it tries to fill and how to identify the ad hoc demand in your e-business.\nTable of Contents\nCustom software refers to software that is created specifically for the demands of a specific e-business, resulting in a specialised set of digital solutions. Each solution contributes to the overall health of your digital product and when combined, they constitute a well-synchronised supporting system with the same purpose in mind.\nToday, the term “custom” is frequently supplanted with the term “bespoke,” which has its origins in the tailoring industry. Bespoke software, like a fine bespoke suit, is tailored to the specific measurements of a given web product. These measures differ from the chest breadth and arm length.\nLet’s have a look at the business aspects that are taken into account while acquiring bespoke software:\n- The intended audience\n- Ethos and concept\n- Needs and specifications\n- Strategy for marketing\n- Market segmentation\nYou may stand out in the industry by availing the custom software development services from a reputed company.\nWhat’s in it for you?\nFollowing the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on both small and large businesses, corporations were forced to consider a contactless method of meeting clients’ demands. The apparent response was the IT sector and thus a massive migration of firms to the digital arena began.\nAs a result, the IT industry was one of the few that did not see a fall in client rates as a result of the pandemic. On the contrary, the need to reorganise and automate the process resulted in an overabundance of clients, which the IT sphere was not always able to handle. However, the industry currently has a sufficient quantity of qualified workers and general aptitude to meet the developmental needs of clients.\nCustomer software comes in helpful when it comes to locating your business in the internet sphere. Here is a list of the top needs that your company may have and that can be met by a software development company USA :\n- Work from home\n- The workflow has been modernised\n- Expansion into e-commerce\n- A long-term marketing strategy is required\n- Supply chain process optimization and acceleration\n- International trading capability\nIf at least one of the aforementioned points appeals to you, then bespoke software solutions are what you should be looking at.\nSo, to make custom development clear to you, we’d like to look at it from a more practical standpoint. To be more specific, let us examine the trends that currently dominate the development industry and will determine its future.\n- Hiring development vendors providing custom software development services from other regions is a new black in development trends, regardless of geographical location, place on the globe map or price and quality of the offered service. And to achieve maximum deadline synergy, there is the alternative of nearshore software development, which implies a vendor’s presence within 1-3 hours proximity.\n- The blockchain’s significance extends well beyond bitcoin and other fintech-related issues. Instead, blockchain gives unprecedented process security and transparency to all types of infrastructures, including logistics, agriculture and healthcare, to mention a few.\n- Development on multiple platforms. Instead of wasting time and money developing a native app for each platform or going through the agony of deciding between iOS and Android, you can simply choose the all-in-one solution.\n- Legacy software upgrade. This tendency is primarily associated with organisations that currently have software but is out of date. In most cases, incompatibility of outdated software with more complex services and products drives upgrades.\nHow Is Custom Software Different from Off-The-Shelf One?\nCustom Software: Make a complete examination of your company’s specifications with specialised software engineers and produce a personalised package of on-demand solutions. There are no extraneous services or goods included, simply solutions critical to the business at hand.\nOff-The-Shelf Software: Off-the-shelf software is typically supplied as an independent product by large software suppliers and comes in bundles consisting of basic digital solution sets. Furthermore, this program has capabilities that you may not require but must pay for because they are included in the bundle.\nCustom Software: Because designers build wireframes during the development process, tailor-made design solutions are completely adjustable. Custom UI/UX is also useful for marketing because it reflects the authentic design and ethos of your website or app. Inclusivity can also be achieved through unique UI/UX and a preliminary understanding of your target audience’s wants and pain points. Finally, bespoke design is distinguished by its great feasibility on both mobile and computer versions of your website.\nOff-The-Shelf Software: Pre-made design templates and patterns are used in the off-the-shelf design. As a result, your chances of getting an inclusive design that meets the demands of all your clients range from slim to none. The scalability of off-the-shelf design solutions is limited, which makes UI/UX transitioning across devices difficult.\nCustom Software: Without any issues, custom software can be integrated with any third-party software.\nOff-The-Shelf Software: Off-the-shelf software has weak compatibility with third-party systems, limiting interaction with other services that increase workflow productivity.\nCustom Software: When you use custom software, its security is entirely dependent on the amount of effort you put into ensuring it. Furthermore, additional financial and human resources are required to maintain your program secure against hacker attacks.\nOff-The-Shelf Software: In the case of store-bought software, security is provided by the vendor, therefore you do not need to take further measures or invest additional money to secure it.\nCustom Software: When it comes to customise system development, financial investments are significant. On the other hand, the price only covers essential services; there are no extraneous features or solutions to pay for.\nOff-The-Shelf Software: Off-the-shelf solutions are ideal for start-ups because they do not require significant expenses. However, the price is not adjustable, which means you pay for all of the solutions included in the off-the-shelf bundle, not only the ones you require.\nBy choosing custom software instead of off-the-shelf options, you can have a strong solution that is tailored specifically to your company’s requirements.

{"id": "2646", "text": "How do you capture a trend in stock or futures trading?\nUnderstanding Market Trends\nBefore we delve into capturing a trend in stock or futures trading, it's crucial to understand what a market trend is. A trend represents the general direction in which a market or the price of an asset moves for a certain period. In trading, trends are used to analyze markets and make educated predictions about the future direction of an asset's price. There are three types of trends: upward (bullish), downward (bearish), and sideways (neutral). Understanding these trends can provide valuable insights and potentially profitable trading opportunities.\nIdentifying the Trend\nIdentifying a trend in the market is the first step towards capturing it. This involves examining the market activity over a specific period. Traders typically use price charts and other technical analysis tools to spot trends. For instance, if the price of a stock or futures contract consistently reaches higher highs and higher lows, it's considered to be in an upward trend. Conversely, if the price consistently hits lower highs and lower lows, it's in a downward trend.\nChoosing the Right Tools\nThere are various tools that traders use to identify and capture trends. Moving averages, trend lines, and Bollinger Bands are among the most popular ones. Moving averages, for example, can help smooth out price fluctuations and identify the direction of the trend. Trend lines, on the other hand, can be used to identify potential areas of support and resistance, which are crucial for trend trading. Bollinger Bands can help identify volatility and price levels that are overbought or oversold.\nTiming Your Entry\nOnce you've identified a trend and chosen your tools, the next step is timing your entry. This is arguably the most challenging aspect of trading. Entering too early can result in losses if the trend reverses, while entering too late might mean missing out on potential profits. Traders often use technical indicators, such as the relative strength index (RSI) or the moving average convergence divergence (MACD), to help time their entries.\nSetting a Stop Loss\nSetting a stop loss is an essential part of trend trading. A stop loss is a predetermined level at which you will close a trade if the market moves against you. It's a way to limit your potential losses if the trend reverses. The stop loss level will depend on your risk tolerance and the volatility of the market. It's important to set a stop loss that gives the market enough room to move, but not so much that you risk losing a significant portion of your trading capital.\nExiting the Trade\nKnowing when to exit a trade is just as important as knowing when to enter. Many traders make the mistake of holding onto a trade for too long, hoping to squeeze out every last bit of profit. However, trends can reverse quickly, and it's often better to exit a trade while you're ahead. Traders usually exit a trade when their target price is reached or when the trend shows signs of reversing.\nManaging Your Risk\nRisk management is a critical aspect of successful trading. No matter how confident you are in a particular trend, there's always a chance that the market will move against you. Therefore, it's important to manage your risk by only risking a small percentage of your trading capital on each trade. This way, even if a trade doesn't go your way, you won't lose a significant portion of your capital.\nLast but not least, successful trend trading requires discipline. This involves sticking to your trading plan, even when things don't go your way. It can be tempting to deviate from your plan in the heat of the moment, especially when you're faced with a losing trade. However, discipline is what separates successful traders from unsuccessful ones. So always stick to your plan, and don't let your emotions dictate your trading decisions.", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}

{"id": "2777", "text": "No matter what type or size of business or organization you operate, your human resources are likely to be your most valuable asset. Managing these human resources (HR) has a crucial cost and productivity impact on businesses of all types.\nWith this in mind, there are some strong arguments in favor of outsourcing a business’s whole HR needs to professional HR management organizations. Such companies will have both the experience and resources to get the very best out of their client’s HR.\nAny small, medium-sized business or even larger corporate body will be fully aware of the high cost of managing human resources. There is an increasing trend of outsourcing across every business strata.\nIn this article, we will take a look at both why and how your business can benefit from HR outsourcing.\nDoing what you do best\nAs obvious as it sounds, you are in business for a reason, and that reason isn’t to manage HR (unless, of course, you are an HR management company), which means that your business has better things to do. By outsourcing your HR, you will be freeing off time, and costly resources focused on doing what your business does best.\nIs there an optimum time to outsource HR?\nWhile outsourcing can be one of the most cost-effective HR solutions, knowing when to outsource, HR is likely to provide something of a challenge, especially to businesses that have invested heavily in their own HR departments.\nBecause efficient HR management is about so much more than just keeping employees happy, there are likely to be certain phases in the growth of a business when outsourcing reaps the optimum results in a short space of time.\nIs there an argument for cherry-picking?\nBecause HR is such a diverse and involved function of a business, there may be an argument for “cherry-picking” certain facets of its overall HR remit. For instance, many companies already choose to outsource the financial aspects of HR, such as payroll or the whole business of training and counseling.\nThere appear to be strong grounds for this separation when considering what outsourcing these particular facets then leaves behind.\nFor example, employee screening can be very industry-specific considering skills, experience, and the overall suitability of a potential employee. The fact that much of this comes under the heading of recruitment also highlights how this part of HR has been outsourced already for decades through recruitment agencies.\nDoes size really matter?\nThere is something of an irony that owners of smaller businesses may feel that they don’t employ enough people to justify outsourcing their HR. However, they are likely to be expending a disproportionate amount of time and resources to managing the real needs of their employees without even considering that it is happening.\nPartnering with an experienced HR management team\nMoving your HR en-mass could be much simpler and hassle-free than you have imagined. There is even a strong chance that the perception attached to making the move into outsourcing hasn’t always been a positive one. Many smaller businesses have trouble “letting go” despite being aware of the potential cost and time savings involved.\nPartnering with a professional HR company that already has a proven track record is likely to make the whole process easier and smoother no matter what size of business you are operating. Whether you choose to outsource specific areas of your business HR or every aspect of them, such specialized companies have the experience and skills to provide cost-effective and meaningful results.\nImage source: Freepik Premium", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

{"id": "2815", "text": "2019 Fiber Connect Recap\nFirst off, I want to thank everyone that came by the AFL booth at the 2019 Fiber Connect in Orlando, Fla. We know there’s no shortage of entertainment in the Orlando area, so it means a lot to us that we had such steady traffic and engaging conversations with visitors. In the case that we missed you, I’ll provide a rundown of what AFL showcased along with some of the larger trends I took away from the show.\nAFL, staying true to our constant strive for innovation, showcased two new products at the show – the FOCIS Lightning Multi-Fiber Connector Inspection System and the OptiNID® Duo Optical Demarcation Enclosure. Both of these products share a common goal – improve speed of deployment and lower the learning curve for users. Other new products were showcased such as the ASCEND™ high density platform, Fujikura CT50 fiber cleaver and Fujikura 31S and 41S fusion splicers.\nWhile FTTH network builds by the larger Tier 1 providers in the US has slowed, an RVA study estimates only approximately 19 million homes are connected with fiber out of 39 million homes with service available. This means that as consumer bandwidth needs continue to increase, approximately 20 million customers have fiber available to them but have not yet taken service. This leads to equipment for drop technicians still being a major need, such as drop cable, compact fusion splicer machines, test and inspection equipment, cleaning tools and fiber demarcation enclosures.\nWhile FTTH Tier 1 builds have slowed, a large market opportunity has begun to arise with rural electric cooperatives building their own fiber networks or partnering with other providers to build these networks to service their members. A 2018 National Rural Electric Cooperative Association survey estimated $68 billion loss in economic value due to a lack of broadband access for 6.3 million homes. Many of our booth visitors at Fiber Connect represented electric cooperatives that are either currently building or investigating building FTTx networks. AFL’s strong position in the energy market segment was on display as we demonstrated our Follow the Power approach and our custom-tailored product solutions for these type of builds.\nAgain, if you stopped by the booth, thank you and we hope you provide AFL more opportunities to show our innovative solution sets to meet your needs. If you weren’t at the show or simply didn’t make it by the booth, please reach out to us and we can discuss how AFL solutions can work for you.", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

{"id": "2853", "text": "Question from Sophie: My dog has regurgitated its food twice in the last hour and is very lethargic. She has now gone to sleep. What is wrong? Should I see a vet immediately?\nAnswer from AI:\nIf your dog has regurgitated its food twice in the last hour and is showing signs of lethargy, it’s important to monitor the situation closely. Regurgitation can be caused by a variety of issues, ranging from simple overeating or eating too quickly to more serious conditions such as gastrointestinal obstruction or esophageal disorders.\nConsider the following steps:\n- Observe your dog: Look for other symptoms such as diarrhea, changes in appetite, or signs of discomfort. Also, check if the regurgitated material is undigested food or if it looks more like vomit, which is digested food and often accompanied by bile.\n- Assess the severity: If the regurgitation happens more than twice, or if your dog shows other concerning symptoms such as abdominal pain, continuous lethargy, difficulty breathing, or signs of dehydration, it’s time to seek veterinary care.\n- Remove food and water: Temporarily withhold food and water to prevent further regurgitation and to give your dog’s stomach a rest.\n- Check for foreign objects: Make sure your dog hasn’t ingested something it shouldn’t have, which could cause an obstruction.\nWhen to seek veterinary advice:\nIt’s recommended to contact your veterinarian if:\n- The regurgitation continues or worsens.\n- Your dog is unable to keep water down.\n- There are additional symptoms such as diarrhea, vomiting, or signs of pain.\n- Your dog is very young, very old, or has a pre-existing health condition.\nLethargy in combination with regurgitation can be a sign of a more serious underlying condition, such as an infection, metabolic disease, or even toxicity. If your dog has gone to sleep, continue to monitor her closely. If she does not improve or wakes up still lethargic, it would be prudent to seek immediate veterinary care.\nRemember, it’s always better to err on the side of caution when it comes to your pet’s health. If you are in doubt or your dog’s condition seems to be deteriorating, do not hesitate to contact your veterinarian or an emergency veterinary clinic. They can provide guidance based on your dog’s specific symptoms and history.", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}

{"id": "2923", "text": "Three months ago, Kenya launched its first space nanosatellite, thrusting the country to the centre of cutting-edge technology. This was a moment of glory as the breakthrough ushered the country into the hallowed ground of elite innovators if not in the world, at least in Africa.\nDuring the launch of the technology dubbed Nanosatellite Precursor Flight (1KUNS-PF), also known as CubeSat, what it did not come out clearly is how the project will benefit the country. Now a report by the University of Nairobi says Kenya stands to reap big from the innovation. Such technologies, the report notes, have a variety of uses, pre-eminent of which is collecting useful data crucial for monitoring and managing its resources better.\nThe report shows that the technology conducts earth mapping, earth observation, land use and environ monitoring, weather forecasting, food security mapping and forecasting. It is also crucial for communication, disaster management, coastline and border monitoring, outer space observation, management of forests, livestock and wildlife monitoring and management.\nThe new technology was deployed into space by Japan’s aerospace exploration agency on 11 May and screened live at the University of Nairobi’s Chandaria Centre of performing arts auditorium.\nWith the launch of 1KUNS-PF, the only fifth in Africa, Kenya joined four other African countries – Egypt, South Africa, Ethiopia and Nigeria —that have launched one satellite each.\nAccording to the Index of Objects Launched into Outer Space maintained by the United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs (UNOOSA), there are 4,635 satellites currently orbiting the planet, an increase of 8.91 per cent compared to last year. Russia launched the first satellite, Sputnik 1, in 1957.\n“Our economy will become tech-driven. Reliable data will be for early warning systems and data marking. Weather data will be key in disaster preparation,” says the report\nKenya’s nanosatellite is the size of a soccer ball and is able to deliver a detailed imagery and information about a territory from space. This means technology advances have become smaller and cheaper, enabling developing countries such Kenya to cost-effectively collect troves of valuable data to be able to effectively manage its affairs and resources. Few years ago, the cost of developing such an advanced piece of technology was prohibitive to developing nations, making them a preserve of the wealthy West.\nThe nanosatellite’s lead scientist Prof Jackson Mbuthia told Enterprise that even though the country already made one of its greatest leaps in the technology sphere by launching its first space satellite, the scientific community still remains relentless with plans to produce “bigger projects”. Building the human capital and a satellite development capacity requires a long term commitment to a space science program, he added.\n“We are still doing more research to have bigger and better technologies in the country. This is just the beginning. When you come back here (University of Nairobi) in about one year from now, we will be able to show you bigger things that we have and the way forward,” said Prof Mbuthia who is also the dean, School of Engineering and Architecture, at the University of Nairobi.\nThe UoN report shows that the nanosatellite proposal was first submitted on 31 March 2016 by Prof Mbuthia and Prof Heywood Ouma of department of electrical and information engineering, to the United Nations, Japan Cooperation Programme.\nFollowing the submission of the proposal, UoN won a grant leading to the development of the 1KUNS-PF.\nThe Kenyan team also composed of Prof Vitalis Oduor, UoN’s lecturer of Cube satellite antennas and communications and about 33 undergraduate and postgraduate students who participated in building the CubeSat. They coordinated with colleagues from the University of Rome.\nThe end product — the nanosatellite – is a 10 cubic centimetre first outer space object registered by Kenya. The gadget consists of two commercial cameras and experimental web audio upload and broadcast, capable of limited earth observation and audio broadcast. Power is stored in two rechargeable battery packs and silicon solar panel, coupled with computer, communication system, GPS receiver and telemetry - an automated communications process by which measurements and other data are collected at remote or inaccessible points and transmitted to receiving equipment for monitoring.\nThe report shows that depending on the mission goals for each year of the space program, the cost of design, manufacture, launch per minimum satellite and gradual setting up of the requisite laboratories require a financial commitment ranging from $500,000 to $1million (Sh100 million) annually.\nA student records a live transmission using a mobile phone during the public viewing of the deployment of Kenya’s first nanosatellite (CubeSat) from the International Space Station (ISS) at the", "scores": {"score": 3, "score_transform_1": 5, "score_transform_2": 5, "score_transform_3": 0}}

Validus Senior Living says its facilities have \"state-of-the-art medical practices and standards, allowing them to maintain value even in difficult times.\"\nBased on this appraisal alone, Truist is now demanding all $83 million be paid back immediately, says Validus Senior Living.\nTruist, one of the largest banks in the United States with $543 billion in assets, did not immediately return a message from the Business Observer.\nTruist decided to do this \"not because of anything Mr. Garcia or VSL Holdings has done, but simply because the bank doesn't like the senior living category anymore,\" Garcia's attorney John Anthony in a statement. \"Here we are right in the middle of the holiday season, and Truist is taking an action that could potentially disrupt the lives of hundreds of senior citizens who call our communities home, as well as Validus employees and their families.\"\nThe most recent agreement between Validus Senior Living and Truist included a loan-to-value ratio of collateral to outstanding debt, the company says.\nAn LTV is commonly used in good faith to measure the strength of a loan, Validus Senior Living says, \"not to be used as a cudgel to chase a compliant borrower out of the bank because the bank no longer wishes to lend in a given sector, even though the borrower is not in default.\"\nThe co-founder of the company says he regrets turning to litigation.\n\"I was the founding chair of a Tampa bank, so I understand the complexities of the commercial lending business and regulation very well,\" Garcia says in the statement. \"I have financed millions of dollars to support our various portfolios without incident, litigation or ever missing a payment. We have always engaged in good faith dialogue with Truist and ... I am saddened that we had to resort to litigation.\"\nDuring the COVID-19 crisis, which hit senior living facilities particularly hard, Truist continued to pressure Garcia to exit its loan with them, according to the complaint.\nGarcia and company says they further reduced the debt owed by $6 million.\nThe federal complaint, filed in the U.S. Middle District of Florida, asks the court for declaratory relief, including \"timely adjudication of this matter so the various Validus properties can continue to serve their senior citizens and their families,\" the company says.\nThis story was updated to reflect the correct debt reduction of $6 million.", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}
{"id": "2929", "text": "Internet of Things (IoT) devices—small form-factor, sensor-based, task-specific hardware—have proliferated across military operations over the past several years. They are used in everything from weapons systems to warfighter wearables to base defense and building operations. The global Military IoT, or MioT, market is wirth $41 Billion and it is anticipated to reach $109 billion by 2030.\nMIOT devices are used to support situational awareness, cyber security and communications, to name a few. Adoption of the devices has been amplified mainly through procurement processes that value price over security. In many cases, lowest price technically acceptable procurements are the reason that many military enterprises have persistent cyber-attack vulnerabilities.\nYet with billions of devices already deployed and many more coming, MIoT remains a large, relatively unprotected attack surface area for adversaries looking to compromise our defense operations. These devices present unique security hurdles due to their diverse, unstandardized ecosystems, varied protocols, updating and patching challenges and lack of compute power, storage space and/or battery power to execute common commercial security defenses. That puts them at odds with the paradigm that is driving much of federal and defense cybersecurity strategy — zero trust.\nIn the past five years, there’s been a lot of ink spilled about zero trust as both a “goal” and as a set of tools and practices for security professionals. The goal of zero trust is to safeguard government agencies and companies from both inside and outside threats. zero trust strategies promote tools, devices, and specific ways of doing things to constantly check and make sure everything and everyone accessing the organization’s data is legitimate and authorized.\nThe zero trust security framework, which includes tools, hardware and procedures, relies on continuous verification and focuses on software-centric data protection and managing user access. However, a zero trust model does not specifically address hardware devices – like MioT – within the enterprise.\nIn an ideal state, these devices would rely on onboard hardware encryption, the absence of which can introduce limitations or challenges in an ideal zero trust implementation. That significant gap, largely omitted in the volumes of current literature, solutions, and practices, overlooks what to do with the physical devices that collect, process, store, and transmit all of an agency’s data—and which comprise much of the digital attack surface. This weakest link leaves adversaries with a sizeable sandbox to play in, even when zero trust technology is utilized.\nMany vendors will point to the data coming to and from an MIoT device as being encrypted and therefore safe. Users also often conflate “hardware encryption of the data collected and transmitted” by a device with the actual encryption and hardening of the device itself. Hardware encryption does in fact provide an additional layer of protection, without which sensitive data may be more vulnerable to theft or compromise if other security measures fail.\nHowever, the assumption that “secure data is good data” is a recipe for disaster. It ignores the gaping hole in a zero trust solution where an adversary is already inside a defense network sending corrupted but encrypted data out to network consumers. Compromising the network can originate through myriad tactics, techniques and procedures used by threat actors, including breaching MIoT devices. Perhaps surprisingly, it is even possible for these devices to be breached through both close network access and physical access.\nConsequently, even secured data gets compromised before transmission or storage. Think of it like corrupting medication at the factory before the tamper seal is put on. Imagine the myriad adverse consequences that could result from data corruption that was accomplished by breaching just one or a few seemingly minor MioT devices connected to a weapons system, a warfighter’s person, or a data center.\nBroadening the model\nTo be sure, hardware encryption, while critical, is not a substitute for the other necessary layers of a comprehensive zero trust security strategy: identity and access management, micro-segmentation, continuous monitoring, strong authentication and more. Defense organizations can still achieve robust security for devices within a zero trust framework even if the devices do support onboard hardware encryption, but they must carefully consider and address the limitations by implementing alternative security measures and best practices.\nAs mandated by the 2022 DoD Zero Trust Strategy, zero trust is clearly essential to future defense network security. The concept of integrating MIoT into a zero trust strategy is gaining traction as a critical defensive construct, and is increasingly recognized as beneficial for comprehensive cybersecurity. However, there is still a lack of both guidance and proper tools and practices to bring MIoT into a true zero trust Framework.\nSince the zero trust ethos of “never trust, always verify” has centered around people and data, the vendors and consulting companies that endlessly promote the promise of zero trust have created a false sense of security for defense organizations that now rely on a staggering number of inherently vulnerable devices. Until a concerted effort is undertaken to harden and reduce the vulnerabilities embedded in those MIoT devices, zero trust will at best be a limited promise instead of a true, comprehensive “solution” available to our military and integral to our national defense.\nPaul Maguire is CEO and co-founder of Knowmadics, a Herndon, Va.-based supplier of risk management products and services to government and industry.", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}
{"id": "2955", "text": "I’m sitting in a hotel ballroom in the basement of the Marriott Marquis Hotel in Atlanta with about 350 people who work for the exoneration of wrongfully convicted and imprisoned men and women all over the United States and in eight other countries besides. We are at the annual gathering of the Innocence Network, a network of groups and projects that help free wrongfully imprisoned men and women, Among the participants here are 86 men and women who have been exonerated for crimes they did not commit. One of these people, James Bain served over 35 years in prison in Florida for a murder that he didn’t commit. I am here with my colleague and friend Ashley Cooper working with another dear friend, Angela Amel. Angela is a social worker with the Innocence Project in New York city and she invited me to work with a small core team of exonerees who helped design an Open Space track for exonerees this year.\nToday we held a circle with about 50 people, just to hear who was in the room and what they did time for and where. It was incredible to hear some of these stories and beyond to see what these men and women are doing now. Not a single one of them has had an easy go of freedom and yet to a person they are doing what they can to free others who have been wrongfully imprisoned. This ranges from running groups, and starting organizations to meeting exonerees at the prison gates and pressing $100 bills in their hands to get them started. Unlike guilty convicts who are able to access a system of resources upon serving their time, exonerees are often assumed to be satisfied with freedom and justice itself. But when you have spent 10, 15 , 20 or more years in prisons like Sing Sing, Utica and Angola, freedom is not an easy transition to make. So to have 86 exonerees gathered here together is a precious moment, to connect and share stories, ask questions of each other and establish bonds of experience and support. Tomorrow we will Open Space with them so they can create and be in the conversations that are most important for them to be in.\nLast night we went out for dinner with a couple of amazing people. Curtis McCarty served 22 years in prison in Oklahoma, 19 of them on death row for a murder he did not commit and Fernando Bermudez, who got out in November from Sing Sing where he was incarcerated for 18 and a half years. What strikes me about these two and the dozens of others I have met is that they are at the same time some of the happiest people I have ever met, and yet there is a deep core of sadness for both what was taken from them as well as what is being taken from others who are behind bars because of mistakes, lies and ignorance. They are imbued with a core purpose that awakens the potential in others, that inspires and invites and draws others to their cause. Curtis is a tireless advocate for social justice, a photgrapher and a death penalty abolition activist whose wife Amy is an ACLU lawyer. The Innocence Network is growing and expanding around a fierce core to extract truth from power and restore freedom to people who are losing decades of their lives to some of the worst prisons in the world as a result of atrocious and tragic miscarriages of justice.\nI was struck today how much the United States is tipping towards a culture of presumed guilt. In receiving an award for an investigative series, two journalists from the Columbus Dispatch related the fact that the question they are most asked is “How do you know if someone is innocent?” It is a question that forgets the foundation of justice in the United States and Canada: that everyone is presumed innocent until proven guilty. It is a sign of the times that people are being forced to prove their innocence. Every person in this room is working with every ounce of will to ensure that justice is upheld in this country.\nI am amazed and humbled at their work, their commitment and their stories.", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}

{"id": "2977", "text": "Can Spouse Drive Company Car\nWorking long hours and living an international lifestyle can be stressful for anyone, however every once in a while you get the chance to make use of the company car and take a break. One of the most common questions people ask is- can spouse drive company car? The answer ultimately depends on the policies of the company and the level of trust that you have built with the company. Before trusting anyone with the car, your employer must have built a level of trust with the person who is driving. It is also important to understand the legal implications when it comes to insurance and liabilities.\nThe first factor to consider is the company policies. Every company has its own set of rules and regulations in terms of who can drive the company car. Generally, it is not permitted to share vehicles with family or spouse without permission from the employer. Different companies have different thresholds and requirements. It is best to check with the specific company before allowing a family member to drive. Most companies will require a certain amount of paperwork and legal documents to be completed in order to protect themselves from any liability.\nIt is important to understand that when someone is allowed to drive the company car, the employer must trust them. Generally, a company will not grant access to an employee’s spouse unless there is a certain level of trust built. Companies will only grant access to those whom they trust to drive the car safely and responsibly. It is important to build that trust in order to be able to use the car without any issues.\nInsurance and Liability\nAnother important factor to consider when it comes to can spouse drive company car is insurance and liability. Generally, it is not allowed to drive any company car without proper insurance coverage. Insurance coverage is something that must be discussed with the employer before anyone can be allowed to drive the car. Liability is another key factor to consider. Accidents can happen at any time and it is important to understand the implications of who is liable in the case of an accident. Generally, the employer is responsible for any accidents that occur while an employee or family member is driving the car.\nIn the instance that the employee and their spouse or family member are granted permission to drive the company car, it is important to make sure that the car is kept in a safe and operational condition. Generally, the driver is held responsible for any maintenance and upkeep of the vehicle. It is important to keep in mind that the company car must be kept in good condition as it is a representation of the company. It is also important to make sure that the car is insured and fuel is regularly replenished.\nBenefits and Drawbacks\nThere are of course benefits and drawbacks associated when it comes to can spouse drive company car. On one hand, it allows more flexibility and the ability to travel together while on the other hand, it could pose a threat to the company’s liability. It is therefore important to assess the situation before granting access to anyone else. Understanding the legal aspects, building trust, and properly maintaining the car are all key components when it comes to driving a company car.\nWhen a company grants access to someone other than the employee to drive the car, it is important to take a look at their driving record. Companies tend to be more cautious when making a decision so they may require a copy of the drivers’ license and records of previous violations. It is important to run a full background check, especially when someone is driving a company car as this ensures that the car is being driven in a safe and responsible manner.\nAuditing the Vehicle\nLastly, it is important to audit the vehicle after the person has been granted access to drive the company car. This should be done in order to make sure that the car is being used for the purpose it was purchased for, and to make sure that all necessary repairs and maintenance have been completed. Regular audits are also a good way to identify any potential issues with the car, as well as any potential abuse of the vehicle.\nWhen travelling in a company car, it is important to make sure that appropriate allowances for travel are provided. Generally, companies provide a certain amount of money for the purpose of travel expenses. These allowances must be properly calculated and accounted for to ensure that the company is not at financial risk. Additionally, it is also important to maintain accurate records and receipts in order to prove that the money is being used for travel and not for any other purpose.\nWhen it comes to using a company car, safety is of the utmost importance. Before anyone is granted access to the car, it is important to ensure that they have a valid license and that they understand the rules and regulations surrounding driving a company car. Companies typically have their own set of guidelines that must be followed in order to ensure the safety and security of everyone involved.\nLastly, it is important to understand the insurance coverage for a company car. Generally, companies purchase an insurance policy that covers the car in the case of an accident. It is important to understand what is covered and what is not before allowing a spouse or family member to drive the car. Generally, the company will provide adequate coverage in the case of an accident.", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

You’ll simply have to EXPERIENCE IT FOR YOURSELF (in order to understand why this TV series is so different).\nPeople are tired of a mock, pseudo, superficial Christianity. They’re realizing that…despite all the hype and emotion UP FRONT…IN THE FINAL ANALYSIS, much of modern Christianity is nothing more than a “FORM of Godliness…WITHOUT THE POWER.” (2 Timothy 3:5)\nYet (…at the same time…) there is a new, God-sent THIRST and HUNGER amongst a relatively small (but RAPIDLY GROWING) remnant of people, to EXPERIENCE, KNOW, LOVE, OBEY,SUFFER FOR AND SERVE the ONE, TRUE, LIVING GOD with all their hearts, souls, minds and strength.\nAnd those same people want a TRUE, STRAIGHT TALKING, PLAIN SPEAKING, “DON’T TELL ME WHAT YOU THINK I WANT TO HEAR, TELL ME WHAT I NEED TO HEAR,” biblically accurate interpretation and exposition of God’s Word.

Today the heartfelt worry was that the Deficit Will Devour Us All, especially if we fall off the Dreadful Fiscal Cliff.\nI attempted to point out that he could relax because on day one the so-called Fiscal Cliff (1) doesn’t do dramatic changes [although I should have added it stops extended unemployment payments, which is a bit drastic], and (2) fully implemented it lowers the deficit, which should have made him happy about his deficit worries. But, no, he said, then people won’t have any money. My attempts to suggest this argued for stimulus spending (and bigger deficits in the short run) failed to crack through what he knew was true: deficits are bad because they cause inflation, and the Fiscal Cliff is bad because it reduces spending money in the economy, and these ideas are not in tension.

{"id": "3049", "text": "Your dog loves tripe and you should too.\nTripe seems to be the thing that distinguishes a novice raw feeder from an old pro. If you’re among the uninitiated, you’ll find feeding tripe to be a real treat (as will your dog). And while it may have one drawback … it doesn’t affect all the good things it will do for your dog.\nFeeding tripe will catapult you to the rank of seasoned raw feeder. So let’s unveil the wonders of tripe before discussing its single fault.\nWhat Is Tripe?\nTripe is the stomach of ruminant (grazing) animals including cows, buffalo and sheep. Stomachs of ruminants have four chambers. These systematically break down grasses with digestive enzymes, gastric juices and amino acids.\nYou may have seen tripe on supermarket shelves. It’s white and bleached form. This isn’t what you want to feed your dog … it’s devoid of any nutritional value. You want green tripe for your dog. It’s the stuff that comes right out of the animal, dripping with those wonderful juices.\nWhy Does It Have To Be Green?\nGreen doesn’t refer to the color. Green just means it’s raw and unprocessed … it’s right out of the animal. And that means it still has pre-digested plant matter and that’s really good for your dog.\nIt’s important that your dog’s tripe is not only green, but raw. Cooking destroys important digestive enzymes in the tripe. That’s why you also want to avoid canned products that may be processed.\nIs Tripe Good For Dogs?\nGreen tripe is not only good for dogs, they love it. You don’t have to coax them into eating it. In fact, many use tripe to get dogs to eat other things.\nAnd tripe has some great benefits …\n6 Reasons Tripe Is Good For Dogs\n1. Tripe Is Great For Digestion\nTripe is great for your dog’s digestion. If your dog eats a cooked or commercial diet, he may have an enzyme deficiency. The juices from green tripe are full of digestive enzymes and beneficial bacteria. They help the ruminant animal digest its food so they’ll help your dog have better digestion too.\nThat means your dog gets the most nutrition from his meals. Digestive enzymes also purify and cleanse the blood, remove toxins, parasites and fungus. They also improve metabolism, hormonal function and boost the immune system.\nThink about what you spend on bottled digestive enzymes and probiotics. Those same wonderful, natural substances are plentiful in tripe for your dog.\n2. Tripe Is Full Of Nutrients\nTripe is full of nutrients: minerals, amino acids and essential fatty acids.\nDogs deficient in nutrients could be suffering with chronic diarrhea, poor skin and coat, gingivitis, inflammation, viral and bacterial infections and yeast overgrowth.\nYou can improve their health by adding tripe to their diet and getting all these nutrients:\n- Manganese, iron, potassium, zinc, copper, manganese and selenium\n- B complex vitamins\n- Vitamins A, C, D and E\n- Perfect 1:1 ratio of calcium and phosphorus\n- Perfect balance of omega-6 and omega-3 essential fatty acids\n- Contains linoleic and linolenic fatty acids\n- Prebiotics and probiotics\n- Amino acids\n3. Tripe Supports Gut Health And Immunity\nNot only is green tripe good for dogs, it’s good for the good bacteria in his gut.\nThe gut is populated by hundreds of different kinds of bacteria or microflora. They’re divided into the ‘good guys’ and the ‘bad guys.’ The bad bacteria causes health issues. They include e-coli, salmonella, campylobacter and listeria. These are from foods and the environment. They could make your dog sick if it weren’t for the protection of the good bacteria.\nThe good bacteria improve immune function by out-numbering the bad bacteria. That maintains a healthy microflora in the gut. Green tripe is loaded with Lactobacillus acidophilus. It’s one of the bacterial ‘good guys’ and the main ingredient in probiotics. Your dog’s gut can only feed so many micro-organisms. He needs to consume more good bacteria to crowd out the bad bacteria.\nMany health issues are caused by imbalance of the good bacteria and the bad bacteria in the microflora. Older dogs are especially prone to this. They tend to have lower levels of beneficial bacteria in their guts.\nAdd lots of raw, green tripe to your dog’s diet. It will maintain a healthy balance of microflora and manufacture more B vitamins. Tripe will also prevent other health disorders.\nHere are other benefits of acidophilus:\n- Treats diarrhea and GI infections\n- Aids digestion\n- Treats chronic constipation\n- Treats symptoms of Irritable Bowel Syndrome\n- Enhances immune function\n- Lowers the risk of pollen allergies\n4. Tripe Is Good For Dogs With Kidney Disease\nRaw green tripe can help dogs with kidney disease. It has a low phosphorous level that won’t conflict with a kidney diet. Dogs love the smell and taste so it can encourage a sick dog to eat. It also has a high moisture content that supports good hydration.\nTripe is a natural food product. It’s not processed and there are no synthetic additives. That makes it easier for the dog to digest and absorb the nutrients that lead to healing. It also makes a great topper to encourage sick or finicky dogs to eat.\n5. Dogs With Food Sensitivities Can Eat Tripe\nTripe has a low allergic reaction and can be fed to dogs with food allergies or sensitive digestive tracts. That’s because it’s considered a white meat with its low levels of myoglobin. That’s the protein that makes red meat red. Tripe often causes less reaction in dogs that are sensitive to red meat. A tripe chew from sheep or lamb is also a good alternative when a dog is sensitive to chicken or beef.\n6. Tripe Improves Your Dog’s Dental Health\nChewing on tripe can improve your dog’s dental health. Give your dog a large rubbery chunk of tripe and it’s like giving him a toothbrush. It will exercise his jaw, massage his gums and scrape his teeth. It’s also highly digestible so your dog will get some nutrients in addition to his chewing pleasure.\nThe Bad News\nNow let’s talk about the elephant in the room … the stink.\nThe rumors you heard are true: tripe stinks! After all, it’s an animal’s stomach where fermentation of what it ate has begun.\nBut instead of thinking about the horrific smell, think about the great stuff tripe will do for your dog. Don’t worry, those dry heaves will go away with time!\nWhere To Find Green Tripe\nTripe is available as raw, ground, frozen, freeze-dried and canned. Today there are many more suppliers catering to dog owners and their needs. It’s more available than ever before in independent pet stores and even the bigger chains. You’ll usually find it in the freezer or cooler section where it’s usually ground and frozen. That’s the easiest to use. There are online retailers that sell it as well. Some even deliver within limits.\nIf you’ve found a raw supplier, you’ll want to find out where it was raised and processed. Local farms and butchers are always best. There are canned varieties but they may be heat processed. That destroys the digestive enzymes. Some are blended with meat making them a green tripe dog food rather than a product for digestion.\nObviously, you will not find it in a supermarket. Your best bet is to find smaller butchers who do custom killing. Be prepared: they will want it off their premises as soon as possible. You may need to supply your own buckets to take it home.\nIt’s also important to note that tripe contains its share of bacteria. Use care when handling it as humans don’t have the natural resistance to harmful bacteria that dogs do. Wash your hands thoroughly after handling.\nNow it’s time to get tripe ready for your dog.\nHow to Prepare Tripe\nCutting tripe can be a nightmare but there are some ways to improve your experience.\nStart with a very sharp knife to cut through the tripe. And be prepared to sharpen it or have a second knife standing by. Tripe is also much easier to cut if it is partially frozen first.\nYou can cut tripe into chunks and feed it to your dog this way. If you have a grinder, you can grind it like any other meat. Tripe also needs to be refrigerated or frozen. Tripe by its very nature is already involved in the digestive process so it won’t keep longer than a few days in the refrigerator. You can package it in smaller servings and freeze. That will also help manage the smell.\nHow To Feed Green Tripe\nYou’ll want to feed raw green tripe to your dog by adding it directly to his meal. If you’re using ground tripe, start by adding a teaspoon to a tablespoon or more depending on the size of your dog. As your dog tolerates it, you can add more. You just don’t want to add too much too soon or he could get diarrhea.\nIf you’ve cut up strips of raw green tripe, give them to your dog as you’d give him a chew. He’ll love it.\nOther Ways To Treat Your Dog To Tripe\nIf you have a dehydrator you can come up with a variety of tripe dog treats. It’s super easy but a bit smelly.\nDehydrated Green Tripe: You may want to move your dehydrator outside or into the garage because of the smell. For this chew, use green tripe. Cut it into strips or bites. Lay the pieces out on trays. Dehydrate for about 9 hours at 150 degrees. Continue to dehydrate until it’s crunchy. Store in the refrigerator in a sealed container for a week or 2. It shouldn’t smell as much when it’s dehydrated.\nTripe Chews: This is a great replacement for rawhide which you should NEVER give your dog. Instead, this is the one instance when you can use the bleached tripe from the supermarket. Cut it into strips and bake in the oven at 325 degrees for 90 minutes. Or use a dehydrator and dehydrate for 14 hours at 160 degrees.\nTripe Snacks: Combine ground green tripe with ground organs like kidney, heart or liver. Try to get a consistency that you can roll or form into strips. Dehydrate or dry in the oven for 9 hours at 150 degrees. Or spread it onto teflon sheets. Dehydrate or dry for a few hours at 150 degrees and then score into strips. Finish dehydrating and break the pieces apart. These tripe treats are great for training or just give as snacks.\nCan Dogs Eat Tripe Every Day?\nYou can feed your dog every day or a few times a week or a few times a month. It can also be a meal unto itself. But you don’t want to serve it as a steady solo diet as your dog will need more balance.\nWith time, you’ll see that the icky parts of tripe are outweighed by the good parts … gloriously good health and vitality for your dog!\nAnd that rise in rank to seasoned raw feeder won’t hurt you either!\nBaillon, ML, et al.

{"id": "3085", "text": "Placing an address on a map either to find or place or to provide business context is becoming vitally important in our society. Location matters.\nMost commonly address information that is stored in a database is not something that is regularly maintained. Often information is captured in free text fields which results in data irregularities and inconsistencies.\nThe purpose of this article is to provide some insight into how to better manage an address dataset which would potentially be batch geocoded and how to optimise the capturing of these address datasets for geocoding in ArcGIS Online.\nThere are a number of variables at play which can affect the final outcome of a geocoding exercise (the most pivotal being the quality and accuracy of the reference data you are matching against) and it is never as simple as receiving an address dataset and geocoding it, often times clients want quantifiable measures of accuracy for the geocoded dataset and the GIS personnel working on the project are often expected to clean and normalise addresses in order to improve match rates.\nHere are a few helpful tips which will help ensure accurate geocodes when using the World geocoder in ArcGIS Online.\n- Use single-line addresses\nGeocoding single-line addresses is both faster and often more accurate than feeding the address records to the geocoder field by field. This is for a number of reasons, the most obvious being that often the incorrect information is captured in the wrong field.\n- An address should look like an address\nThe ArcGIS Online geocoder uses a form of programmatic pattern matching. If an address does not match the patterns in the locator, your geocodes suffer.\nBest practice is to ensure your addresses look as follows:\n[HOUSE NUMBER] [ ] [STREET NAME] [ ] [STREET TYPE] [, ] [SUBURB] [, ] [CITY] [, ] [PROVINCE] [, ] [POSTAL CODE]\n[CORNER OF] [ ] [STREET NAME] [ ] [STREET TYPE] [ ] [AND] [STREET NAME] [STREET TYPE] [, ] [SUBURB] [, ] [CITY] [, ] [PROVINCE] [, ] [POSTAL CODE]\n[POI] [, ] [SUBURB] [, ] [CITY] [, ] [PROVINCE] [, ] [POSTAL CODE]\n- A city is more important than a suburb\nSuburbs in South Africa remain loosely defined and differ from dataset to dataset. The inclusion of extensions creates an additional host of problems and often suburb names change, or an individual may say their street falls in a neighbouring suburb for various reasons. You are more likely to get an accurate geocode using a city alone instead of using a suburb which does not match the suburb in the reference data you’re matching against.\n- Never trust a postal code\nMany people do not even know their postal code and it does more harm than good by including an incorrect postal code in an address for geocoding in ArcGIS Online as the address will be scored down. What makes things even more confusing is the fact that a particular street may have a ‘box’ code and ‘street’ code which differ and both may not be accurately represented in the reference data being matched against. If you are going to include postal codes in your addresses to geocode, please ensure they all have four digits, otherwise ArcGIS Online will not recognise the postal code for what it is.\nClicking the image above will download an archive containing a toolbox with a simple Python script that uses a lookup table of freely available data from Statistics South Africa and the South African Post Office to attempt to normalise and clean address datasets prior to geocoding particularly for ArcGIS Online. You can use it in the same way you would use any other tool in ArcMap. Applying the 80/20 principal we have attempted to use the minimal amount of code in order to clean and normalise the majority of addresses, however each dataset is going to have its own nuances so it will be up to you modify the script in order to optimise it for each of your use cases.\nIf you’ve never used Python, don’t despair, the tool already does most of the heavy lifting for you and there is still much to be gained by adding text replacements and additional street types to the portions of the code indicated below. Simply navigate to the toolbox in an ArcCatalog window, right click on the script and select “Edit…” to be able to incorporate the additional records as and when required. If you would like to add additional functionality, some Python scripting knowledge will be advantageous.\nUltimately, the expectations for any geocoding exercise need to be realistically aligned with the quality of input address data. We must be aware that many datasets in South Africa still have a long way to go and with the dynamic nature of road networks there will always be gaps in the reference data used for geocoding, even in ArcGIS Online. It is up to us as the GIS users to ensure that we prepare our data correctly prior to geocoding in order to achieve the favourable results we seek.", "scores": {"score": 3, "score_transform_1": 5, "score_transform_2": 5, "score_transform_3": 0}}
{"id": "3095", "text": "For owners and operators of wind turbines, maintaining the integrity of these giant pieces of machinery is a considerable challenge. Fortunately, there are a few key tricks of the trade that can make the challenge one that can be easily managed.\nThe primary function of wind turbine rotor brakes is to prevent the rotor from turning while the turbine is in idle mode or during an emergency.\nIt is important to keep these brakes well maintained to help prevent damage to expensive drivetrain components, as well as providing a level of safety for maintenance and service teams. As a general rule, brakes should be inspected at least once every year.\nHowever, if turbines have demanding operating schedules, the maintenance interval may need to be shortened, as brake parts tend to wear out based on frequency of use.\nA careful visual inspection of the brake pads is important, since minimum required thickness of the friction material and a consistent pad wear pattern allow the brake to provide and apply full torque, without slipping on the brake disc.\nThe brake caliper and hydraulic system should also be checked for any damaged hoses or oil leaks. Sliding rods (if on brake) should move freely and pad retracting springs should be functioning properly.\nWhile inspecting the rotor brake system, the same attention should be given to the yaw brake system. If caliper-based, the process of replacing yaw brake pads has been made considerably easier with the introduction of a new lifting tool.\nThis time-saving device can be used by a single service technician to lower the brake caliper to the floor for easy inspection and brake pad replacement, and then for lifting the caliper in place.\nProduct and services selection\nSvendborg Brakes, Stromag, Twiflex, Ameridrives and Warner Electric are the five brands that sit within the Altra Renewable Energy family.\nBetween these five brands, Altra Motion Australia is able to provide a wide range of products, services and solutions to support the global renewable energy market.\nAs industry leaders in power transmission and motion control products, Altra Motion offers critical wind turbine drivetrain solutions, including rotor and yaw braking systems.\nImportantly, all Altra Motion products are backed by a genuine spare parts guarantee. In addition to this, many parts manufactured by Svendborg Brakes can be instantly and easily authenticated thanks to their unique Holographic Fingerprint label.\nWhen the label is scanned in the Svendborg Brakes app, users can confirm that the components of the part in question are genuine.\nExperience and expertise\nThe company also offers training, technical support, scheduled maintenance, 24/7 global service support and upgrades as well as manufacturing long-lasting genuine spare parts, including calipers, brake pads, seal kits and sensors for all their brake brands.\nUtilising genuine replacement parts optimises brake performance and extends component life.\nThis sponsored editorial is brought to you by Altra Motion Australia.

{"id": "3128", "text": "By Sher Wyn Tan\nGrowing up, Dr Jill Ho had an affinity towards science and people; hence, she pursued medicine. Initially, her career choice was met with resistance from her father, but at the eleventh hour, he had a change of heart and supported her decision.\nLooking back, she believes her dream was God-inspired because even as a teenager, she saw being a doctor as an opportunity to minister to the unreached. Amid her father’s resistance, she prayed, “God, if it’s Your will, allow a 180-degree change in my dad.” And He did.\nToday, Dr Jill is the field coordinator of LINetS (Life Inspired Network Society), an NGO that champions suicide prevention efforts. Her journey into the field is a remarkable one, displaying God’s hands at work as He led her step by step into the purpose-driven life He has called her to.\nStepping out in obedience and faith\nAfter graduating, Dr Jill started out in a government hospital, where she spent four years gaining experience and knowledge in different subspecialties. Then, she decided to take a year’s sabbatical for a break and to adjust to being a new mother.\nOne year later, she felt God leading her to resign from government service. After much thought, prayer, and discussion with family, she took that step of faith even though the path ahead was uncertain.\nWhen God leads, He leads all the way. And soon after, Dr Jill was approached to be part of Klinik Kecheerian (now known as Autrui Clinic), a clinic offering medical services at subsidised fees to refugees and other vulnerable communities.\nIt was a perfect marriage of her passion, purpose and professional expertise. She worked there for eight years and loved every minute of it.\nWhere medicine could not reach, prayer worked\nDuring her time with Klinik Kecheerian, she realised that many patients need beyond their physical health, especially emotional and relational needs.\nKnowing the power of prayer, Dr Jill would ask if she could pray for patients when medical solutions proved limited in treating their ailments. She remembers many miracles, witnessing how God moved mountains in these patients’ lives through prayer.\n“Sometimes we cannot see what’s around the corner, but God can. We have to just trust Him step by step. We just follow His lead; when He says stop, we stop; when He says go, we go,” she says.\nShe vividly remembers praying over a patient who was worried about taking a 12-hour flight with a big wound on her thigh.\nBut when she visited a hospital to check on her wound after arriving at her destination, she found it completely healed with flesh forming and the staples coming off.\nOn another occasion, she met one of her patients along the mall’s corridors (the clinic is located in Summit USJ). Dr Jill felt led to pray for the woman as she has been unsuccessful in trying to conceive.\nSoon after, the patient informed Dr Jill that she was expecting, and eventually gave birth to a healthy baby boy!\nAn upended dream and learning to follow where He leads\nWhen the pandemic struck, a decision was made to close the clinic. For Dr Jill, who had thought it was her life’s purpose and destiny, the news came as a thunderbolt.\nShe found herself grieving and going through feelings of anger, frustration, disappointment, discouragement and sadness. It was not easy, thinking of all her patients and the lives impacted by the clinic’s good work.\nHowever, God remained sovereign. Klinik Kecheerian was reopened as Autrui Clinic, managed by Collective Church and continuing its legacy of impacting communities with quality medical services.\n“That’s our good God, He will always take care of everything that He starts in our life,” Dr Jill says.\n“Even if it’s not us [who gets to] continue [the work]. He will bring someone along to ensure continuity, growth, and multiplication. He will not leave us hanging and will move us into something new.”\nThe Holy Spirit also comforted and reminded her that some months before, God had given her a double confirmation through her quiet time and a sermon that He was going to do something new in her life (Isaiah 43:19).\nThe realisation helped to cushion the impact of the clinic’s closure; she was now assured that God knew what was coming and had prepared her heart for repositioning.\nIn her last days at the clinic, she sat in her office and prayed, “God, so what do I do now? I really don’t know, I feel so lost. Please remind me of Your purpose for me.”\nBringing good news to the poor in body, spirit and soul\nLed to Isaiah 61:1-3, Dr Jill felt God’s vision for her life is to bring the good news to the poor in body, spirit, and soul. This mandate has since chartered her way forward, defining the work she takes on and the direction she moves in.\n“When we live our lives according to God’s purpose, the joy, satisfaction, and strength that you get from it, you cannot get anywhere else,” she says with conviction.\nToday, Dr Jill is the field coordinator of LINetS (Life Inspired Network Society), an NGO that champions suicide prevention efforts.\nAccording to World Health Organisation (WHO) data Malaysia’s suicide mortality rate increased from 5.10 – 5.77 per 100,000 population between 2014 and 2019. In other words, there was an estimated 1,841 suicide deaths in 2019, a staggering average of five suicides per day.\nThe “Youth Suicide in Malaysia” report by Relate Mental Health Malaysia stated suicide to be a leading cause of death among youths in Malaysia.\nAccording to the report, official numbers are conservative as the “true suicide rate is estimated to be approximately eight times higher than official certified suicides. And for every death by suicide, there are 10 to 20 more suicide attempts.”\n“I need to love myself in a healthy way to be able to love others”\nSoaring suicide cases have propelled the Health Ministry to work with the Education Ministry for early intervention programmes in schools and to develop a National Suicide Registry.\nThe registry seeks to provide detailed and accurate statistics on suicides to help the government make informed decisions on suicide prevention programmes and policies.\nOn 22 May 2023, Parliament (Dewan Rakyat) unanimously passed a bill to decriminalise attempted suicide, a historic move that will now see greater focus on compassion and support instead of punitive measures.\nWith LINetS, Dr Jill coordinates suicide prevention efforts through five pillars:\n- Media (producing suicide prevention and mental health resources),\n- Education (training in private education institutions and government schools)\n- Counselling (sessions with special rates services for students & the marginalised)\n- Resources (upcoming counselling festival on September 9, 2023)\n- Technology (planning to launch a crisis hotline – calls & text)\nHer motto is to “love God, love others, and also remember to love myself in a healthy way because I need to be healthy to be able to love others.”\nDr Jill also recounts various near-death incidents throughout her life, including nearly being bitten by a snake while walking to school, almost drowning, a choking scare and near-miss accidents. She believes that each time, God preserved her life so that He can use her to save the lives of others.\nShe feels three times more fulfilled now. Previously, she ministered to people just in body as a doctor to the poor and marginalised, now she ministers to others in spirit by supporting the needs of church ministries, and also in soul through LINetS.\nHelping people to have hope by saving minds and lives\nThroughout life’s journey thus far, God has shown Dr Jill that she’s not moving away from her passion and His calling for her. Instead, her purpose has taken a different form.\n“From a medical perspective, we save lives through CPR, procedures and medications. But for the soul, we save lives through suicide prevention, by helping people to have hope, to save their minds and therefore their lives.”\nGod has also graciously brought Dr Jill back to Autrui Clinic, where she now volunteers on a weekly basis to see pregnant patients. She is also a visiting doctor with PERCH (Peter Faber Convalescent Home), where she visits and follows up on in-patient refugees.\nOn an ending note, Dr Jill shares, “I’ve learned to not hold things too tightly to things in my life. Previously I thought I’d live and die with the clinic. I don’t know how long I’m going to be doing this, but I’ve learned to be more open to God’s taking me wherever He wants to.”\n“If He could change the direction of my life in such a significant way once, He can do it again. Of course, I do not ask for it to happen a lot because I don’t like change,” she says with a laugh.\n“But if God wants to do it, I will go on that journey with Him. It’s about faith and letting go.”\nAll photos provided by Dr Jill Ho.", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

Although it may not always be immediately apparent, psychological abuse can cause serious harm.\nCertain signs can indicate your elderly loved one may be suffering psychological abuse. Schedule a free, no-obligation consultation with our skilled West Palm Beach Nursing Home Abuse lawyers to learn if legal action against negligent caregivers is an option for your family.\nWhat Is Psychological Abuse?\nPsychological abuse, also called emotional abuse, refers to any actions that make a victim feel fearful, depressed, anxious or intimidated. This type of abuse can occur in situations where an aggressor is in a position of power and takes advantage of that power against the victim. In nursing home settings, aggressors may be staff, caregivers or other residents.\nTypes of psychological abuses include:\n- Being isolated from other residents or visitors\n- Being excluded from activities\n- Being ignored by caregivers\n- Threats made by caregivers or intimidation\nThis type of abuse can affect the health and well-being of residents and may be inflicted along with other abuses, such as physical abuse.\nNursing home residents are often susceptible to psychological abuse because they depend on the facility’s caregivers and staff for assistance with basic needs.\nNursing Home Residents at Risk\nAlthough any nursing home resident could suffer psychological abuse, there are certain people who could be at a greater risk. These residents include:\n- Those age 75 and older\n- Those who have memory problems, causing the inability to recall abuse incidents\n- Those who experience social difficulties and issues interacting with other residents\n- Those with long-term health conditions such as paralysis or dementia\nSigns of Psychological Abuse\nAccording to the National Center on Elder Abuse, elderly victims who suffer psychological abuse may show signs such as:\n- Sudden behavioral changes\n- Withdrawal and lack of interaction with people\n- Aggression that is random or sudden\n- Lack of communication\n- Behaviors often attributed to dementia such as biting, rocking, mumbling or sucking\nVictims of psychological abuse may be afraid or unable to report a caregiver’s actions or tell loved ones their experiences. For this reason, it is important that family members are aware of these warning signs and regularly visit their loved ones.\nWhen behavioral changes come on suddenly, watch your loved one closely and observe their environment. If staff members or residents seem overbearing, this can be a sign your loved one has suffered psychological abuse.\nReporting Nursing Home Psychological Abuse\nPsychological abuse may cause trauma that affects the victim for the rest of his or her life. If psychological or other abuse is suspected, it should be reported right away and the victim should be removed from the risk of further harm.\nIf your loved one is in immediate danger because of the abuse inflicted by a nursing home staff member, resident or caregiver, contact the police right away.\nYou should also report any concerns of poor care to the managers of the nursing home facility. If nothing is done to correct the situation, contact the Florida Department of Elder Affairs to file a report. Reports can be made by phone, fax or online.\nYou should then contact at trusted nursing home abuse attorney to learn more about your loved one’s legal options.\nContact Our Nursing Home Abuse Lawyers Today\nNursing home residents rely on caregivers for assistance with basic needs.

And her companion for this journey? A male she had actually satisfied online, however one she currently felt a connection to-- an elegant escort called Stefan.\nJenna pictured his strong arms around her, the sensation of his breath on her neck as he whispered sweet absolutely nothings in her ear. Their interactions had been flirty and lighthearted, but Jenna knew that they would soon be connected in the most intimate of methods.\nAs the plane touched down in paradise, Jenna's heart raced. After inspecting into the resort and dropping her bags off in her stunning cottage, she heard a knock at the door.\n\" Night, Jenna. I'm Stefan.\"\nA high, good-looking male stood in the doorway, his muscular arms crossed in a casual however powerful position, providing Jenna a friendly, knowing smile.\n\"Hello there Stefan, begun in. It's nice to finally satisfy you,\" Jenna said nervously, her face flushing as she stepped aside to let him into her haven.\nStefan walked in and began to walk around the bungalow, taking in the views of the glittering ocean, and the inviting king-size bed that dominated the master bed room. Jenna could feel her heart beat quicken as she saw him roam confidently around her short-lived house.\n\"I hope it's to your preference. I really desired everything to be best for us,\" she stammered, playing with her hair as she spoke.\nStefan turned to face her and reached out his hand, gently tucking a strand of hair behind her ear. \"It is more than ideal, Jenna.

Jenna felt her attraction for Stefan grows with each passing minute.\nThe sun lastly disappeared behind the horizon, leaving them alone with a light sea and a glowing moon breeze. Stefan stood and held out his hand to help Jenna to her feet. As she grasped his hand, she felt an excitement of excitement as his fingers linked with hers.\n\"Let's walk along the beach,\" he suggested with a warm smile.\nJenna nodded wordlessly as they roamed together along the shoreline. As they walked, ocean water lapped carefully at their bare feet, providing the ideal soundtrack to this romantic interlude. Stefan sometimes looked over at Jenna with a smile and after that back to the horizon, creating a sense of comfortable silence in between them.\nAfter a while, the set found themselves back at their bungalow. With a flirtatious look, Stefan started to lead Jenna toward the open door, his strong hand never ever leaving her grip. As they crossed the threshold, Stefan paused, looking deeply into Jenna's eyes.\n\"Are you all set?\" he asked, his voice barely above a whisper.\nJenna took a deep breath, her body hurting for him, and nodded. \"Yes, I want this,\" she responded, her voice shivering with anticipation.\nStefan led her to the bedroom, where he took the lead in undressing her slowly, with the tenderness of a fan, and not with the voracity that often dominated these types of encounters. He explored her body with his hands and mouth, awakening unidentified yearnings and desires within her.\nShe, in turn, undressed him, valuing Stefan's toned body and manly grace. They quickly fell under a rhythm of expedition and pleasure, their mutual needs heightening as the night extended on.\nStefan's fingers, lips, and tongue expertly directed Jenna through a maze of enjoyment, taking her to heights she had actually never experienced before. Their intimate connection grew more powerful as the hours passed, fueled by the envigorating mix of desire, trust, and carnal expedition.\nAs the very first light of day began to creep into the space, whispering an end to their night of enthusiasm, Jenna understood that the sun would rise on a new chapter of her life. One filled with newfound desires and unrestrained exploration.\nAnd Stefan?

These wonderful narcissus bulbs grow indoors over winter and feature clusters of small, beautifully-scented crisp white flowers from tall green stems. If you planned ahead, you may have forced them from bulbs, but you’ll also find them ready-to-go from most garden centres. These make a wonderful table decoration dressed with moss at the base and a selection of added twigs from the garden to make a truly stunning Christmas display.\nHelleborus niger are one of my favourite flowers, boosting any garden scheme, container or indoor display. They are known as the Christmas rose since they flower in winter; although it's not actually part of the rose family. They flower from December through to mid spring and even after the blooms fade they still have a wonderfully decadent feel and bring a froth of summery delight to your winter garden.\nThese hardy perennials grow well in shade in well-drained soil. If your soil is heavy, try growing them in a container, with some grit added to the compost to improve the drainage. A large container is best, as they have an extensive root system.\nBeauty berry 'Snow Queen'\nThe white beauty berry ‘Snow Queen’ (Callicarpa bodinieri) is a fantastic, and unusual form of deciduous shrub with delicate pink flowers in summer and large clusters of white, bead-like berries that appear in the autumn and continue right through the winter. The bare branches filled with pure white berries look beautiful in Christmas arrangements and dotted around the home, plus they’ll brighten up any winter garden – and will be popular with birds.\nMore like this\nWhile ivy has a presence year-round, it shouldn’t be overlooked in winter. With its festive star-like leaves, it symbolises new growth and is said to bring good luck. Ivy also brings an abundance of decorative charm, not only to the garden with its vibrant green but can decorate Christmas wreaths and hearths intertwined with offcuts of spruce. Ivy has a vigorous growth habit; so much of your care might involve pruning it back to where you want it. Why not try more unusual forms of English ivy such as Hedera helix ‘Pink ’n’ Curly’ which is a bushy plant, with waved, curly leaves?\nWhatever you choose, or wherever you plant or decorate your festive landscape, enjoy it all. The natural world offers us a beautiful panoply throughout the entire year.", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}

Reminds me of those sci-fi movies made in the 1960s give or take that try to suggest what the future will be like.\nMy husband and I watch a lot of movies (that he picks up at the library) at home as our unwind-together time after the boys are sent to their rooms for the night. Since we homeschool the boys don’t go to bed till close to 10pm so Joel and I only get in about half an hour to an hour of a movie. It takes us days to get through one movie sometimes. As you can imagine we watch a lot of old movies. Some oldies are in the sci-fi genre and will be set up as “in the future” like 2047 or something.\nIsn’t it funny how unrealistic these movies portray the distant future? Anyways…\nI thought it would be kind of fun this year to do a “top 18” instead of a top 10 list of my most viewed posts for 2018. You’ll find all of those links down below. There’s a lot of good information in those links. I hope you find something helpful.\nMy Word for 2019\nI don’t always choose a word as inspiration for a new year but I have had a desire on my heart and that desire is summed up in one word: redeem. Specifically, redeem as in Ephesians 5:15-17 and Colossians 4:5-6.\n“See then that ye walk circumspectly, not as fools, but as wise, redeeming the time, because the days are evil. Wherefore be ye not unwise, but understanding what the will of the Lord is.” Eph. 5:15-17\n“Walk in wisdom toward them that are without, redeeming the time. Let your speech be alway with grace, seasoned with salt, that ye may know how ye ought to answer every man.” Col. 4:5-6\nSome other definitions for redeem include (from Merriam-Webster):\n– to buy back, repurchase, to get or win back, to make worthwhile, to retrieve, to offset the bad effect of, to exchange for something of value (and so on).\nMy focus is on the definition of “exchanging for something of value”. Exchanging my time for that which is valuable.\nTime is fleeting and so much more the older we all get. We can never get back the time that has past, it is spent, so we must make the most of the time we have now and which is before us.\nMy priorities are the things that God says are a priority: Him, people and His word. As for people: my family, church family, friends, neighbors and others that God wants me to reach out to. But most importantly, my husband and children. Regarding my kids, I want to be training them in the ways of the Lord. This opportunity will be gone soon as they will one day be adults making decisions out of the foundation that my husband and I have laid in their life.\nTruly, these are not new priorities for me, but it is what is on my heart and I feel led to let it inspire how I live more intentionally in 2019.\nHave you picked a word for 2019? Do you have any special goals this year you want to share in the comments?\nTop 18 Viewed Posts for 2018\n#13 – USA Presidents from Ohio", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

{"id": "3256", "text": "How much does a professionally designed, custom built website cost?\nA guide to understanding the cost of custom web design and marketing.\nShort answer: It varies for each client based on specific requirements & needs. But now the long answer:\nOften we are asked to give some ballpark pricing based on creating a simple, yet highly professional online presence. After all, realistic web design cost & pricing aren't something you can easily find online. Cheap offers are everywhere! Web.com offers FREE custom (really?) web design. DIY websites and templates are all marketed as \"custom web design\". These are \"hook you in\" long term revenue models for sites that literally take minutes to build. Heck, I get an email every other day with a $499 custom web design offer (along with the obligatory \"We will rank you #1 on Google\" offer). No wonder there is so much confusion (and poorly built, cookie-cutter sites)!\nDon't believe the spam. Creating a powerful and influential USER EXPERIENCE (aka: your website) takes careful planning, talent, passion and serious know-how. Your site is where your customers form opinions about your products and services...it's not a place to cut corners.\nNonetheless, custom website pricing poses an important question, because many companies find it hard to even guess at what they should be budgeting. How can you determine your web design cost and budget if you don't know what goes into creating a great site?\nIn this article, I’m going to bare all and break down the cost of custom web design for you. Though I can't provide exact web design quotes without a formal consultation, what you learn may surprise you!\nThe following post walks you through the stages of consideration needed to determine a web design budget for your business.\nStep 1: Establish a realistic marketing budget. Learn the standard benchmarks that should be used to set aside an overall amount for the promotion of your business through marketing and branding – as the online face of your company, your website plays a key role in marketing, so you should think about branding when obtaining web design quotes.\nStep 2: Determine website pricing for your industry. Take a look at your competitors’ websites from every angle – from design quality and depth of information to usability and range of featured tools – and assess what you need to do to effectively compete against them.\nStep 3: Understand the full scope of your true needs. Consider the costs of the foundational elements that need to be developed along the way, to build a website that is optimally designed to attract prospects and drive conversions. An accurate web design budget will account for all of these needs.\nStep 4: Discover the power of your new brand. Experience the difference that a well-executed branding and marketing campaign can make – by returning on the investment you've made on website pricing through a variety of improved metrics.\nLet’s examine all of the facts and figures behind the cost of your next website overhaul so you know what to consider when evaluating web design quotes....\nStep 1: Establish a realistic overall marketing budget.\nYour marketing budget will vary depending on the size of your business and industry – but experts agree it should be between 4% and 12% of gross sales for your business.\nFor brand-building and brand rejuvenation projects most small businesses will spend between $15,000 to over $75,000 for agency-like results and strategies. (Average from our historic records and reported sales from other small agencies) Some companies will spend a LOT more…some a little bit less…but to do a high quality job from this is an accurate range for a custom web design pending complexity, required technologies and other related services that may be needed such as email templates, copywriting, 3rd party applications, animations, plug ins, blogs, etc. Other key components you may need (listed below) also will add to your total.\nNote: This does NOT include any ongoing marketing. Large companies spend millions in branding, so this example is focused on small and medium sized businesses (SMBs), not the big boys.\nWhen I say “key components,\" I’m referring to the essential branding elements of a custom web design and marketing campaign that most companies need to establish themselves:\n- Strategy & Planning Naming / Logo\n- Custom Website\n- Messaging / Copywriting\n- Online Brochures\n- Presentations / Videos (Complex videos alone can drive the range beyond what’s cited above)\n- Blog Design\n- Landing Pages\n- E-mail Templates & Designs\n- Social Media Optimization\n- Exhibit Design\n- Ads & Direct Mail\nThis cost logically adjusts to how many (and which) of the above brand assets are in the budget during the initial branding or rebranding efforts.\nYou will need to add a monthly budget for ongoing advertising and marketing, also consistent with the size of your business and your expected revenue.\nStep 2: Determine custom web design costs for your industry.\nYour website is not a stand-alone marketing tool. It is, in many cases, a prospect’s first impression of your brand. It is also the place your prospects go to either form or validate an opinion about your company – before they decide whether to take the next step. It’s the most important element of your brand image, and it sets the pace for your conversion process. Remember this when you're looking into web design quotes! Your web design budget must include the full scope of branding that you need - not \"just\" for \"a website.\"\nTo do this, you’ll first have to assess your industry and look at what your top competitors are doing. Just getting to the “design phase” requires going through an in-depth marketing discovery process and then formulating a web marketing plan. Trying to build a site without this initial investigation and planning is like trying to build a house without surveying the land or creating any blueprints. It's going to fall apart.\nThis is often hard to do as most competitors won’t want to share this with you. A place to start is through your professional and industry associations, vendors, employees who may have work experience elsewhere, etc. to get a range or even a percentage of revenue as a starting point for creating your marketing and web design budget.\nStep 3: Understand the full scope of your true needs.\nTo be successful, your website will need to include most of the following components and media. To build a site without them is like going big game hunting with a pocket knife. A solid web design budget will equip your campaign with all of the strategic tools needed to nail your target audiences, including:\n- A discovery process, including the production of a well-articulated creative brief – the essence of your marketing and sales strategies.\n- A sitemap, an outline of your website which shows all the navigation and pages. This should be completely centered around your customer’s needs.\n- Visual direction and messaging, aligned with your marketing objectives.\n- A design and layout for your homepage, based on an agreed-upon visual direction and messaging.\n- A design and layout for an interactive subpage / interior page template, which will inform your visitors, and guide them through your site while maintaining your own brand identity.\n- Professional copywriting or content optimization, which will allow prospects to scan the text efficiently, while offering compelling information to pique their interest and drive them toward your calls to action.\n- Animations or scenes, to stimulate interest and communicate key points without crowding the page.\n- A custom-designed blog, a critical component for the modern marketer, as a free PR machine and an SEO staple.\n- E-mail templates, which match your new online brand. Email marketing offers the best ROI in marketing, making it a must-have!\n- A downloadable PDF brochure or content piece with easily-digestible information—so your prospects can share it, print it, and/or archive it, turning it into viral media.\n- Online conversion forms. Why make it difficult for someone to contact you? Interactive forms make inquiries a breeze and data capture automatic.\n- Search engine optimization. Your site should be designed in a way that’s search-engine-friendly. By thinking ahead, you’ll be well-positioned to appear high on search engine results pages (SERPs) for phrases associated with your products and services.\n- Calls to action through dedicated landing pages, destination pages that lead customers to act on the specific conversion goals established in your creative brief.\nThis list could easily go on, but you get the idea. There’s a ton of foundational work needed to construct a website that is effectively built to sell what you have to offer.\nFor most of these items, web design cost will range between a few hundred to a few thousand dollars each – so you can quickly see that building a successful online brand via your custom website is going to take a serious investment.\nOf course, a site that is built correctly will grow revenue and increase awareness of your brand more than you can imagine! Our clients have experienced revenue growth that has paid back their investment hundreds of times over! It's not so much what you spend on your custom web design budget, it’s about how your expenditure affects revenue growth.\nThe Bottom Line\nIf you want a professional online brand that will recoup its value, you need to set a web design budget and hire a firm that is talented and passionate.\nSomewhat related to your website pricing is your ongoing marketing efforts. Things like: Landing page promotions, email marketing, lead nurturing, advertising, search & social marketing, etc. These are usually based on your approved marketing and web design budget using the range above. Most are monthly recurring. I recommend you spend 25-45% of your total marketing budget on these advertising and marketing tactics. The goal here is to bring in enough qualified leads to build your business and grow your client base.\nStep 4: Discover the power of your new online brand.\nBy now, you probably realize what it takes – and thus, what it costs – to build an effective and conversion-oriented online brand. Website pricing may seem steep, but the rewards will be tremendous.\nHere is what you can expect from a website done right:\n- Increased confidence in your brand from employees, prospects, and clients.\n- Substantially greater numbers of prospects who visit your site.\n- Considerably more positive first impressions on your visitors.\n- Increased interest and conversion for your products and services.\n- Measurable results, which can be used to further improve your online brand and customer conversions.\n- The ability to \"nurture\" the 90%+ of prospects that have a \"buy later\" mentality, through a system that nudges customers all the way through the sales funnel.\n- Increased referrals.\n- More repeat visitors, fueling even more conversions.\n- Multiple return on your investment, resulting in substantial revenue growth.\nWe’d love to hear your views on this topic.

{"id": "3269", "text": "Tax Attorney – Bellevue And Seattle IRS Audit Reconsideration\nEven after a liability has been properly assessed by the IRS, the taxpayer may still be able to challenge the liability. This is referred to as an “audit reconsideration.” If successful, the tax liability will be adjusted accordingly by the IRS. A taxpayer may request that the matter be sent (back) to the examination function for a redetermination of the liability, even after receiving a collection notice. This is accomplished by simply making a written request to the Service employee handling the matter, indicating that one of the circumstances for doing so applies. It should be mentioned that the IRS is not required to suspend collection activity while the audit reconsideration is approved, so often an installment agreement must be made until the matter can be resolved.\nThe circumstances for audit reconsideration, include but are not limited to:\n- The liability has not been finally determined by means of a closing agreement, court decision, OIC, etc.\n- The taxpayer requests in writing that an assessment be abated based upon information not previously considered which, if timely submitted, would have resulted in a change in the assessment.\n- There was a Service computational or processing error in adjusting the tax.\n- The taxpayer never received notification of a balance of unpaid tax due prior to action by the collection function.\n- The taxpayer did not appear for the audit or examination of his return.\n- The taxpayer filed a delinquent return after the Service filed a Substitute for Return per section 6020(b).\n- The taxpayer moved since filing the return that gave rise to the delinquency and never received the statutory Notice of Deficiency.\n- If the delinquent tax derives from a failure by the taxpayer to substantiate deductions, he never had the opportunity to submit the necessary substantiation and he now has the necessary documents.\nIf the Revenue Officer returns the matter to the examination division, the Service will sometimes suspend further collection activity while the matter is under consideration, but they are under no legal obligation to do so. If the examination function determines that the underlying tax should be adjusted, the collection officer will take whatever action is required.", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}
{"id": "3271", "text": "When you think of a blacksmith, what do you imagine? Do you picture a soot-spattered worker from a renaissance fair or fantasy setting? If so, you might be surprised to learn that blacksmithing is still a modern-day practice. Keep reading to discover some modern-day blacksmithing applications that you might recognize.\nBlacksmiths are known for working with metal. The whole blacksmithing process requires smelting metal from an ore by heating it past the metal’s melting point. Once a blacksmith has their desired metal, they can form it into nearly anything. One of the applications for blacksmithing is metal furniture. Patio and other metal furniture feature intricately designed legs, seats, and backs, which require metals to be heated and maneuvered.\nSome blacksmiths use the metal-heating process to create art out of different working materials. Blacksmiths know how to cut, turn, and twist metal into a variety of shapes and designs, and experienced blacksmiths have precise control over their materials. These techniques are perfect for designing and constructing metal art and other features.\nBlacksmiths who craft replica weapons are known as bladesmiths, and they’re just one of the different types of smiths. Weapons-crafting is common in modern blacksmithing, and it’s even featured on reality TV shows such as Forged in Fire. Some blacksmiths, who are known as gunsmiths, even specialize in crafting and repairing firearms and firearm parts.\nBlacksmithing techniques can also be used to make modern tools. We have these blacksmithing techniques to thank for tools that we use every day, such as chisels, hammers, hoes, vices, and shovels. Modern blacksmiths can even construct axes and crowbars.\nPlanning a construction project? Some of your building materials and other hardware may stem from blacksmithing techniques, too. Some examples of blacksmith-made hardware include keys, locks, hooks, nails, screws, and more. Many of these objects are mass-produced nowadays, but professional and independent blacksmiths are fully capable of constructing such items, too.\nThese have been some of the modern-day blacksmithing applications and crafts that many modern blacksmiths create. Were you surprised to find that modern blacksmithing techniques are infused into so many of the items we use every day?", "scores": {"score": 3, "score_transform_1": 5, "score_transform_2": 5, "score_transform_3": 0}}

{"id": "3305", "text": "Earlier today, in federal court in Brooklyn, former New York City Department of Correction (DOC) officer James Internicola pleaded guilty to federal program fraud, admitting that he fraudulently obtained a significant amount of salary and overtime pay by lying about the hours he worked. The proceeding was held before United States District Judge Kiyo A. Matsumoto. When sentenced, the defendant faces a maximum sentence of 10 years’ imprisonment. Internicola resigned from the DOC after his arrest.\nBreon Peace, United States Attorney for the Eastern District of New York, James Smith, Assistant Director-in-Charge, New York Field Office (FBI), and Jocelyn E. Strauber, Commissioner, New York City Department of Investigation (DOI), announced the guilty plea.\n“The defendant defrauded the City of New York by falsely claiming to have worked thousands of hours and fraudulently pocketing more than $170,000, when he was actually at home, vacationing in Aruba or elsewhere,” stated United States Attorney Peace. “The defendant’s greed cost taxpayer’s substantial money and threatens to undermine public confidence in our government institutions. This Office and its law enforcement partners are committed to fighting corruption on Rikers Island.”\nDOI Commissioner Strauber said, “This defendant, while a New York City Correction Officer, lied about the hours he worked, claiming to be on duty when, in fact, he was at home or on vacation, in order to obtain more than $170,000 of City funds by fraud. The criminal conduct that he has acknowledged today does not reflect the dedication and integrity of the many City employees who show up every day to do their jobs and serve their fellow New Yorkers. I thank our law enforcement partners in the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of New York and the New York Office of the FBI for their commitment to protect City resources and to ensure that employees who defraud the City will be held accountable.”\nAccording to court documents and facts presented at the guilty plea proceeding, Internicola fraudulently obtained more than $171,000 in salary and overtime pay by lying about the hours he worked from at least July 2021 to January 2023. During this time, Internicola claimed to work large amounts of overtime nearly every week. In fact, based on license plate reader data, E-Z pass toll records and cell site location information, Internicola frequently showed up to work more than two hours late and left work several hours early. In many instances, Internicola claimed to be at work when he actually never showed up to Rikers Island at all, including when he was at his home on Staten Island, visiting the Jersey Shore or vacationing in Aruba. In total, Internicola claimed to have worked more than 2,250 hours more than he actually did in a period of approximately 18 months and he fraudulently received the equivalent of more than a year of his base salary.\nThe government’s case is being handled by the Office’s Public Integrity Section.

Abreu is seen as Jeff Kent’s replacement at second base, though Kent is still going strong and his 2008 option becomes guaranteed with 550 plate appearances this year.

A dozen years after they met backstage at the Winnipeg Folk Festival, Canadian-via-Dublin folkie Stephen Fearing and Australian-via-Belfast singer-songwriter Andy White met up in Calgary in March 2010 with the intention of saying goodbye to their longtime songwriting collaboration.\n“Every year we’d meet and just sort of sit at Stephen’s kitchen table and write more songs and get better and better,” says White. “We met to cancel the whole project and to have one final tour, which would be great fun.”\nBut after listening to the songs the friends had crafted over the years, they realised it was stupid to just throw them away, even though their geographical distance and lack of finances made recording the tunes seem impossible.\n“It’s what songwriters try to do, is gather collections of songs like this,” says White.\nIt seems fate would intervene; a buddy had just announced he wanted to start a record label and threw his support behind Fearing & White. So the duo headed into a studio in Guelph, Ont., to make their long-time dream come true.\n“We went and made a record in the old-fashioned way where you go into a studio and two weeks later you come out with a record,” says White. “It was very organic and a very carefully written record. Every line has been really thought about and executed very spontaneously.”\nIt sounds like a bit of a contradiction, a record that’s both spontaneous and meticulously crafted. But given the long incubation period of the tunes versus the short recording period, it makes sense. The 13-track record is a plugged-in hybrid of Fearing’s folk stylings and White’s U.K. pop sensibilities. And while White says the record is based around their vocal harmonies, Fearing & White was also an opportunity for the two musicians to trade their usual acoustic guitars for some different instruments.\n“[Fearing] has got such a great electric-guitar style; it’s really beautiful,” says White, who played bass on the record. “He can really get at it, and when he gets an electric guitar in his hands, he’s like a kid again.”\nThe duo also managed to tap drummer Ray Farrugia to add some percussion to the album, giving it a fuller sound than one might expect.\n“That’s why there’s loads of atmosphere and fun stuff going on,” says White. “It was born around the kitchen table with me and him writing in the classic singer-songwriter fashion, but there’s an awful lot more going on.” M\nStephen Fearing & Andy White8pm Friday, March 18Hermann’s Jazz Club, 753 ViewTickets $25hightideconcerts.net", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

{"id": "3469", "text": "The program title “Diversity of Beauty” hinted at the clean, bright beauties pulled from The Baroque Orchestra of New Jersey’s core repertoire of Baroque, classical and Romantic chestnuts.\nBut the concert, which took place at The Morristown Unitarian Fellowship on Jan. 21, achieved something else. Beneath the charming veneer, maestro Robert W. Butts took a minimalist approach that condensed the musical and dramatic elements to the bare essentials and brought out the emotional essence of each work. There was a vitality and directness to their musical expression that spoke to the individual strengths of the musicians. The stylistic approach was low on frills and fussiness. Moments of virtuosic flair were present but fleeting.\nThe first half of the program was dedicated to delicate, alluring pieces by composers Antonio Vivaldi, Samuel Coleridge-Taylor and Johann Sebastian Bach. Despite their beautiful simplicity, the works are deceptively difficult to play, requiring intense finger work and impeccable technical command from the strings.\nThe ensemble’s orchestral palette of 16 mixed strings (with four woodwinds added to the second half of the program) was not wide, but projection and penetration was full. The overall timbre sat relatively low and deep, which made for an unexpected dark, broody expression on sparkling, effervescent repertoire that usually calls for the bright, sweet and high colors of the lighter strings. The impression was soulful.\nButts announced that, due to illness, some musicians had cancelled, and revisions were made to the program. “Welcome to winter,” he apologized wryly, to the full house.\nThe first half carried an impromptu feel that Baroque music can sometimes inspire. Vivaldi’s Concerto in D minor for strings RV 127 was loosely knit with long and leisurely phrases in the middle largo. Tight bowings in the final allegro made for searching, wandering passages.\nColeridge-Taylor’s Novelletten, Op. 52 dipped into romance. The set of four short movements for string orchestra from the early 20th century are thought to be inspired by Robert Schumann’s set of solo piano miniatures of the same name from 1838.\nThe third movement, andante con moto, was one of the selections cut from the program. It features a virtuosic violin solo that captures Coleridge-Taylor’s affection for strings. The gifted violinist attended Royal College of Music for composition at the same time as Gustav Holst and Ralph Vaughan Williams.\nThe first two movements unfolded with cautious tempi but still managed to capture the dancerly rhythms and colorful characteristics of the work. The allegro molto finale was fitted with muscular dynamics and ferocious bowings that gave an experimental, modernistic appeal. Larger strings added creamy textures to the mix.\nBach’s crowd-pleasing and inventive Brandenburg Concerto No. 3 in G Major provided glimpses of the beauty referenced in the program title. The work is one of six instrumental concerti written by Bach and presented to royalty of Brandenburg-Schwedt in 1721.\nBach wrote them in the concerto grosso style, which features soloists grouped in combinations (as opposed to a single soloist playing against the orchestra), with this one scored for three violins, three violas and three cello soloists. It opens ravishingly with the grouped soloists, but the positioning of the solos changes frequently and independently, weaving in and out of the entire ensemble.\nUsually the middle adagio movements of these concerti grossi are stately and slow, but in this one, a single measure of two chords acts as a musical coda. Modern performances approach it in various ways. Sometimes the chords are followed by an improvised cadenza from either a violin or harpsichord; sometimes short movements from other works are inserted; and sometimes, like at this concert, they are treated exactly as written.\nThe outer allegro movements, including the ritornellos, were taken at a confident clip. Virtuosic moments appeared here and there but the focus was on the melodic and harmonic lines, which came easy under the leadership of Alyson Whelan in the concertmaster chair.\nMozart was still a teenager when he wrote Symphony No. 27 in G major from 1773. It is short and sweet, and wrapped in the breezy Italianate style.\nDemanding passages of the allegro were played more pensive than delicate, though flute and bassoon duos shed some buoyancy and light. The andantino grazioso brought out some refined shading and clean octave work from the cellos. The violins and violas explored the complexity of the final presto’s motif, ending with a soft coda.\nMezzo-soprano Teresa Giardina sang the program’s two opera selections by Henry Purcell and Christoph Willibald Gluck, both of which are beloved Early Music mainstays that have crossed over into the operatic mainstream with transpositions up and down the vocal tessitura.\n“Dido’s Lament (When I am laid in earth)” from Purcell’s 1689 chamber opera “Dido and Aeneas” is an aria of great emotional depth, melancholy and beauty. It is sung by Dido, Queen of Carthage, dying of grief as Aeneas sails off to Rome.\n“Che farò senza Euridice” is Orfeo’s iconic aria from Gluck’s 1762 “Orfeo ed Euridice.” Grief-stricken Orfeo wonders how he will live without his dead wife Euridice, after causing her death along their journey from the underworld.\nGiardina sang both arias naturalistically, with somber poise, leaving aside Baroque articulations and word painting. Her sweet, glacé mezzo layered nicely against the ensemble’s darker overtones.\nFor more about The Baroque Orchestra of New Jersey, visit baroqueorchestra.org.\nWe need your help!\nCONTRIBUTE TO NJARTS.NET\nSince launching in September 2014, NJArts.net, a 501(c)(3) organization, has become one of the most important media outlets for the Garden State arts scene.

{"id": "3502", "text": "Good morning. One word to sum this all up... unprecedented.\nThe wildest market in history. Another word that sums up the last few weeks... surreal.\nhaving the qualities of surrealism; bizarre.\n\"a surreal mix of fact and fantasy\nnever done or known before.\"the government took the unprecedented step of releasing confidential correspondence\"\nIn the span of just a handful of weeks the stock market went from fresh record highs to lows not seen since.... the end of 2018.\nIn 2000 and 2008 it took years for the market to fall from highs... ....this time its been weeks. This collapse has got us back to prices from just over a year ago? Does that mean we haven't fallen enough? Or that the recent 15 months of upside was too far too fast?\nPerhaps these weeks of selling will morph into months of continuous selling sending us back down to where we started in 2000 and 2008?\nTo think that we've seen the ugliest market since the dawn of man... and we couldn't even break the December 2018 lows? Cue the thinking emoji......\nIn December 2018 the market fell seemingly every day. It wasn't until Christmas Eve 2018 until the market decided to reverse. It wasn't as historic a decline as we've seen the last few weeks, but it was one that signaled to many that the bull market was over. Growth was done. And the market had finally topped. I'm sure so many feel that way now. That the market is DONE. Those that came back after 2000 and 2008 may finally throw that towel in.\nFast forward a year. It's December 2019 the market is hitting fresh all time highs on almost a daily basis. Trade war news, Middle East conflict, among many excuses to sell, continue to get shrugged off.\nEven this new Virus in China we are slowly hearing about is not bothering the market. The dire twitter posts of people just collapsing in the street did not seem to bother the market one bit.\nChina shutting down Wuhan? Shoulder shrug.\nBut the cracks were slowly forming.\nThen on February 20th.... in the early afternoon... with the SPY just off fresh all time highs and trading around $338.... it dropped $3 in the span of 30 minutes. Heavy selling out of no where. No news. No exuse. Just downside. That was ominous.\nOf course $3 of downside in minutes today is about the norm. But less than a month ago it was abby-normal. The market ended up recovering much of those unexplained losses... but that was the beginning of the nastiest decline the market has ever seen in such a short period of time.\nThe Virus has ended up doing the unthinkable. Shutting down the entire Global Economy. The implications of which no one really knows for sure.\nFear is at all time highs. Panic has gripped the world. And the stock market has been gyrating around like it has never done before.\nYesterdays near 3,000 point decline on the DOW was the largest EVER.\nAnd this came the day after the FED dropped its Funds rate back to zero and pledged some $750 billion of QE.\nIn 2009 this helped bottom the market... in 2020 it preceded the largest market rout in history. Clearly participants are spooked.\nThere was a lot of fear in 2008 as well. The financial markets were broken. And no one knew if they would ever get fixed.\nThis time around the market has no idea the extent of the damage this Virus will cause. Will the world ever be the same again? Will the markets ever go up again?\nYes and Yes.\nI know the old adage.. be greedy when others are fearful. I don't know that we are there yet. Could this be just leg 1 of two or three more legs lower for the market?\nIt's possible. Remember in 2008 we didn't bottom because of the small windows people had to exit funds. The selling came and went, howver it wasn't done in 2 weeks.\nMy humble thoughts?\nThose a long way from retirement , even if this market has more downside to go, will likely look back years from now and wonder how they were able to get some of these companies so cheap. Those with a shorter term time frame and not willing to risk more losses should likely rethink their investments.\nThis market collapse is like a forest fire. It hurts. It causes pain. But years down the road that forest is greener, healthier, and more wonderful than it ever was. We got a nasty forest fire. The flames are still burning. The smoke is thick. But we are going to get through it. No doubt about it.", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

This program is set up for students to learn at a distance, traveling to Berkeley for class intensives. In the era of COVID19, I’ll be doing my classes on Zoom. And I plan to stay with you all as your religious educator, this is an additional vocation but does not end my commitment to faith formation and Unitarian Universalism.\nWhy do you want to do this?\nThere are two reasons: I’ve already done most of the professional development that is available for religious educators and my thirst for lifelong learning has me looking for the next step to keep learning and growing, and I have felt a calling to tend to the grieving of our world as we face climate chaos and systems collapse/deep adaptation.\nWhat is a Chaplain, anyway?\nTraditionally, a chaplain is a clergy person who is attached to a secular institution in order to minister to the spiritual needs of people in that institution. There are hospital chaplains, prison chaplains, and military chaplains. A chaplain is different from a minister in the focus of their work, but there is overlap between the two vocational callings and the seminary training is often the same.\nDoes this mean you’ll be a minister?\nSort of. To answer this question, it is important to clarify that if I am successful and become ordained, it will be as an Interfaith Chaplain. I would be ordained and able to wear clerical vestments and officiate at ceremonies, but not as a Unitarian Universalist minister. I will not be pursuing that path, and will not be in fellowship as a UU minister. So while I will be clergy, I will not be a UU minister.\nThis seminary journey will likely take me two to three years.

{"id": "3547", "text": "Vivo S1 can turn out to be one kickass model for the Chinese phone maker who is still eyeing destiny more like Samsung, Huawei, or Xiaomi as far as brand trust is concerned. The first Vivo phone we used was Vivo V7 Plus, and ever since then, their subsequent models have kept impressing us. Of course, there were shortcomings and flaws in V9 and V11 Pro, but there were always more pros than cons.\nSomehow, V15 and V15 Pro did not have the kind of craftsmanship we expected after the V11 Pro. Their popup selfie camera was a newer trend in favor of a full view display, but they failed to impress us aesthetically. However, it was interesting to see their motorized camera concept getting followed by Oppo F11 Pro and Huawei Y9 Prime 2019, but our views about their popups are no different.\nThis time, it is altogether different in the case of Vivo S1. We will talk about the design in the following part, but for now, it is enough, it’s one damn shiny gadget.\nAfter using this phone for a couple of weeks, we realized that Vivo had created a benchmark for itself in the mid-range category. Is it rightly priced or not, and in what way it has inspired us, let’s find out below in our review.\nVivo S1 specs\n- Display: 6.38 inches Super AMOLED\n- OS: Android 9.0; Funtouch 9.0\n- Chipset: Helio P65\n- RAM/ROM: 6GB/128GB\n- Camera (rear): 16MP + 8MP + 2MP\n- Camera (front): 32MP\n- Battery: 4500 mAh\nDesign and Display\nThe moment you hold the phone in hands, it speaks loud of its design language. We used Huawei P30 Pro a few months back, and the S1 kind of reminded us of the color pattern on its backside. Not only the skyline color resembles, but somehow, the triple-lens placement seems to have been partially inspired by their Chinese rival.\nDespite its shiny rear outlook, which gives us a feel of glass, it is a plastic body that merges with the front glass through a much more polished plastic RIM. Overall, this formation has helped keep the weight of the device on the lower side.\nUsual controls occupy sides of the device; a dual SIM + microSD slot is on the left side that also shares the space with a dedicated Jovi button; the right side has a power key and volume rockers. The top is empty, and the bottom side is busy with our favorite audio jack, microphone hole, micro USB cable slot, and the speaker grille.\nTurn on the device, and you get a full view display with a water-drop notch noticeable at the top and houses the front camera. Right above the notch, there is an ear speaker grille delicately placed at the edge.\nWe wouldn’t call it a bezel-less display due to a considerable bottom chin and top black stripe that appears when you try to hide the notch from the settings menu. It’s not easy though as you have to activate or deactivate the notch on the app by app basis. Vivo should have provided a universal control more like other brands.\nVivo S1 offers a Super AMOLED screen, which was the feature in Vivo V15 Pro earlier but the same was not a part of the standard V15. This time it is a common trait of both S1 and S1 Pro, which is a welcome sign. The 6.38 inches screen, 1080p resolution, further adds value to the screen beauty which does not degrade the viewing experience by more than 25% under direct sunlight. Watching from extreme angles also does not blur the view, another good sign for movie maniacs.\nEver since we are using Funtouch, the newer version (9.0), gives a more comprehensive feel. We don’t like the bloatware that comes attached to Chinese phones, but some of them have proven to be very useful. Honestly, I would like a few to go away; for example, vivo.com, though it gives price updates on Vivo phones, it still is an unnecessary addition.\nOn the other hand, Kids Mode is helpful to almost anyone who shares his/her phones with the kids. It can restrict their app’s usage and duration. Kids can’t alter the settings unless they have your password or access to the fingerprint scanner.\n“i Theme” has lots of makeup and customization options, but most of them belong to the youngsters. Maybe Vivo is targeting youngsters more with this phone, but it should be bringing more stuff for all age groups.\nOn Vivo S1, you will likely use at least three areas more frequently; Notification Center (swipe down from the top), Control Center (swipe up from the bottom), Smart Launcher (swipe right, if enabled). You can manage most of the daily tasks from here quite easily. Instead of digging deep, you need to get used to it for easier access to almost anything.\n“Easy Touch” is another easy way to access the apps and tools for quick execution, but it solely depends upon your personal choice. When turned on (Setting>>More Setting>>Easy Access), it parks a circle on the edge of the screen, tap on it, and it will show your pre-selected icons.\nAll these four areas have their benefits and limitations, but in my opinion, the pros exceed the cons. Vivo must avoid the duplicate existence of tools in these shortcut areas for improvising the user experience. The phone comes with a plethora of feature that is enough to customize the look and working of your S1, thanks to more than complex Color OS.\nA Few more things I liked and disliked about this phone;\n- Face unlock is quick and works like a charm, even in the dark.\n- Recent apps can be blurred for keeping the privy eyes away\n- Task Timer is an excellent option to avoid disturbance during critical hours\n- Privacy and app encryption/file safe are handy features\n- The behavior of defaults app can be changed from System App Settings\n- Jovi image recognizer is still useless as before\nPerformance and Battery\nVivo S1 is the first phone that carries the newly launched Helio P65 (Mediatek 6768) Octa-core chipset that offers better AI support and a 2x performance boost than the previous version of the family. There is Mali G52 GPU that, coupled with the main chipset, promises better graphic handling, especially the gaming experience.\nHere in Pakistan, Vivo introduced two variants, 6GB/128GB and 4GB/128GB, which work seamlessly with the new chipset.\nMediatek’s P65 scored much better on Geekbench (single-core: 1844, multiple-core 6014) than its sibling P70 did for Oppo F11 Pro and Vivo V15. Though, P65 falls in the middle of P60 and P70, but don’t let this placement confuse you as this chipset is the successor to both of them and exceeds in performance by a considerable margin.\nOn paper, the specs look convincing, but S1 isn’t short of skills on the ground either. It handles heavy multitasking with ease without showing a disappointing performance. We always test our phones on 4G data for keeping our tests as close to real-life usage as possible.\nHeavy multitasking does not choke the phone or cause any stutter apart from a slight lag that hits us while switching the apps, especially the browser. Otherwise, the phone ran damn smooth and it never felt like a mid-range device to us.\nVivo S1 carries a 4500 mAh battery that is accompanied by the fast charging characteristic. Like many areas, the battery is another feather in S1’s cap because it lasts as long as you would expect it to. It never betrayed us, both indoors and outdoors.\nIt took 2 hours and 20 minutes to charge S1 on several occasions fully. However, in our back to back 720p video playtest, it lasted for 18 hours and 4 minutes. We do the video test with both the SIM cards active and the Wifi turned off.\nIn another session, it only dropped 12% of the battery during 113 minutes of the Netflix session while I was traveling on the highway with 4G connected all the way. The phone consumed nearly 585 MB of data while streaming movies.\nIn our typical 3 hours battery test that we perform on every phone to test its might against data-hungry apps, Vivo S1 consumed 46% battery in 3.5 hours of consecutive drainage on social media, gaming, and video calling.\nHere is a summary of our battery test;\nTriple and quad camera is the rage today and Vivo isn’t behind. The phone comes with a triple-lens setup featuring a 16MP wide-angle, 8MP ultra-wide, and 2MP depth sensor, all placed vertically on the left side along with an LED flash underneath the lenses.\nThe default camera app inside is clean and straightforward, offering every required mode on the default interface which is very unlike Huawei’s camera app, where HDR, bokeh, and wide-angle ask for a couple of more clicks to reach.\nIn the camera department, the strength of the Vivo S1 lies in its front selfie camera. The 32MP lens of f/2.0 aperture captures some fine details of the subjects that we haven’t experienced in the earlier mid-range Vivo phones. Its autofocus tracks face brilliantly, no matter whatever you put in between the lens and the subject, the focus remains on the face.\nPhotos appear very pleasant on the phone’s screen, but they make you look unrealistically fairer – something very much in-demand for the social media presence. But on larger screens, images look less artificial. It’s the AI that does the magic and makes everyone beautiful.\nVivo heavily relies on the software-based beauty modes which it calls AI treatment and Vivo S1 has tons of such tools to revamp your look altogether.\nThe front cam offers panorama shots, videos, fun videos, and AR Stickers. Fun videos could be the most popular tool for youngsters and elders alike. Though it looks quite childish, it can be very handy for Tiktok and Instagram content creators. The tool can use a lot of inbuilt filters and background sounds for dramatizing a few seconds .mp4 social media ready video.\nVivo S1 can take Wide-angle and Bokeh photos through its 8MP ultrawide angle lens and 2MP depth sensor, respectively. The primary lens of 16MP can take some impressive pictures, which are mostly higher in contrast, but when the wide-angle toggle is turned on, the photos lose some essential details and a warmer effect creeps in. AI treatment in Vivo S1 is quite aggressive and a little faulty as well; it tends to overexpose the images from both, rear and front lenses.\nHowever, the camera grabs very decent details of subjects in the standard mode. Have a look at the following two images and their cropped version to see a difference between 1x and ultra wide-angle.\nDaylight photos with both, front and rear lenses, are rich in details, HDR keeps things higher in contrast and punchy but sometimes overexposed to such an extent that makes backgrounds look flat, especially the sky. Pictures look vibrant on its AMOLED screen, and they don’t lose much of their flavor on bigger displays either.\nS1 doesn’t seem to struggle much at night, either, as long as you are not zooming in. It washes out some details at 1x, but going beyond 3x loses way too much.\nBokeh isn’t perfect, especially for the subjects with sharp edges, and you might notice a merged outline around the subjects which sometimes spoils the photo.\nVivo S1 is an all-rounder in the mid-range price category. This beautifully designed device can easily process everything you throw at it. Apart from the looks, the battery is the primary feature that makes Vivo S1 a much-desired device. The camera is the area where Vivo S1 still needs improvement. The bokeh is not perfect and so are the overly treated photos that look less than natural. If you are not a big fan of AI-based artificial images, turn it off, however, if you are looking for a perfect camera phone that could handle every lighting situation besides being a powerful device, Oppo F11 Pro is the phone you should consider as well.", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

If the monthly statement indicates a sum of less then €5 net no payment will be made and the right to one is forfeited.\n4. Distribution Activity of a Distributor elsewhere\n4.1 Without the prior written agreement of PM, it is not permissible for a Distributor to undertake activities for a competitor of PM. A competitor of PM is taken to be any company which offers goods or services through personal direct marketing or via a network marketing system as well as, independent of the means of distribution, all companies with products partially or fully in a position of\ncompetition to PM products.\n4.2 A Distributor is obliged to keep every permissible distribution activity for another company completely separate from the activity for PM and with PM products. It is not permissible to draw attention to activity for PM or the status as a PM Distributor, or to offer goods and services of the other company together with PM products, or to cause other Distributors of PM in any way whatsoever to purchase goods or services from the other company or to become active for the other company in addition to or instead of their activity for PM.\n5. Purchase and Distribution of PM Products\n5.1 A Distributor orders and receives PM products exclusively and directly from PM. It is not permissible to purchase PM products from another Distributor.\n5.2 A Distributor sells PM products exclusively by personal direct distribution to end consumers. Distribution via retail outlets, at markets, trade fairs, internet auctions and similar sales events is not permissible.\n5.3 A Distributor is obliged to take back PM products sold to final consumers within 30 days of delivery; particular reasons need not be given by the customer to do so, it is sufficient if they simply do not like them (PM satisfaction guarantee). After taking back goods, a Distributor lets the customer choose between exchange, credit note or return of the purchase price paid.\n5.4 A Distributor freely decides whether and what quantities to buy from PM. There is no obligation to order a minimum amount.\n5.5 All orders by the Distributor are processed according to the PM price list valid at the time of ordering. Prices are generally to be understood as being without sales tax and costs of packaging and shipping, as far as these are applicable. Before every shipment of products, their payment must have been secured or completed. This is possible via direct debit from a bank account, payment via credit card, cash on delivery or cash payment on collection.\n6. Further Obligations of a Distributor / Contractual Penalty\n6.1 A Distributor always has to act as an independent and responsible business entrepreneur and has to avoid any possible appearance of acting as an employee of PM or of being entitled to make declarations in the name of PM.\n6.2 In so far as PM is a member of national and international associations for direct marketing, Distributors must strictly adhere to the standards of conduct specified by these associations for their members and their distribution representatives; PM will inform Distributors without delay of appropriate standards of conduct which must be adhered to.\n6.3 Everything a Distributor says about PM and PM’s products must be in accordance with PM’s stipulations, especially those in the product catalog, on the product labels and in other product information. On no account may a Distributor attribute therapeutic or healing properties to PM products.\n6.4 A Distributor may make no changes to PM products or their packaging and also not allow third parties to make such changes. It is permissible to include an address label with address data of a Distributor on a label as long as no advertising or product information is covered by it.\n6.5 A Distributor is to use only the product information, sales material and sales aids issued by PM in advertising for PM and in the distribution of PM products and, in so far as advertising and distribution is done via the internet, only to use the internet shop which PM provides for Distributors. In self-made advertising materials or on web sites of their own, Distributors may neither make a reference to PM nor to PM products, nor use trademarks or other commercially protected patents of PM.\n6.6 For every violation of obligations under No’s. 4.1, 4.2, 5.1, 5.2, 6.3, 6.4 and 6.5 of the Distributor Rules, a Distributor will pay a contractual penalty, the amount of which will be stipulated by PM in each individual case taking into account the significance of the violation and the income of the Distributor, Further claims, especially for an injunction and damages will not be affected by claiming a contractual penalty.\n6.7 Every distributor has to acknowledge and adhere to the binding statutory regulations and to the generally recognized rules of behavior of direct marketing both in general advertising measures and in attracting new distributors. This leads in particular to an express prohibition of any form of ’spamming’ and of the systematic head hunting of distribution partners from other companies. Violation of this will be strictly followed up by PM, even down to termination of the partnership. PM additionally specifies general rules of behavior which must be strictly adhered to at all times. This is available under www.pm-international.com.\n7. Line protection\n7.1 It is a principle of PM-International to keep and protect the sponsor line. A business partner who has terminated his business partnership can only be re-registered as a business partner if he submits a new application and (a) is sponsored by his former sponsor or (b) at least 12 months have passed since termination. A business partner who has been structured out by being deleted from records as an inactive business partner (12 months without personal volume) can be freely re-registered with an new application, i.e. not just under the former sponsor but in any line under any Sponsor.\n7.2 The line protection also applies to customers in the Customer Direct Program (see point 7.1). Customer line protection is valid for 6 months.\n7.3 Spouses can each have a Distributor number. It must be ensured that one of the spouses must be exclusively registered in the direct line (firstline) of the other spouse. Children who are of business age can (within the organization of their parents) also be registered exclusively in the organization of their parents or of one parent. Siblings, parents, grandparents and grandchildren can also be registered exclusively in the first line.\n8. Concluding Stipulations / Alterations\n8.1 The contractual relationship between the parties is governed by the law of the Federal Republic of Germany. 8.2 The court of jurisdiction for any disputes is Speyer (Germany), if a Distributor on conclusion of this contract or when court proceedings are started is neither resident in Germany nor is usually to be found there; the right of one contractual party to make a claim on the other party in their jurisdiction remains untouched.\n8.3 A contractually agreed-upon requirement for written form is also met by telefax or e-mail.\n8.4 PM will announce an alteration of the Distributor Rules to a Distributor in writing. The alterations are taken as having been accepted if a Distributor does not dispute them in writing within three weeks of the alteration being announced. This consequence has to be expressly stated by PM in the announcement.\n8.5 I agree to PM running a credit check about me. I agree to personal data which affect our business cooperation, being collected, stored, processed and used by PM using automatic and other procedures.\nPDF-Version to Download and Print", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

{"id": "3584", "text": "On the back of a serious financial crisis, Cyprus has decided to boost its photovoltaic development. New measures include: the large-scale application of net metering in residential systems (low income households will be given priority); the introduction of a new plan, which permits industrial and big commercial consumers to develop their own PV generation units; and a speeding up of the licensing procedure for the PV projects approved via a tender in January.\nThe new measures, CERA says, aim to reduce electricity prices for the households where net metering is applied, via fuel saving and carbon dioxide reduction. Jobs in the design and construction of the PV projects are also expected to be created.\nThe decision, CERA continues, has been taken in order to protect electricity consumers by helping mitigate the severe effects of the economic crisis. Ensuring reliability and security of the electricity system was also taken into account, it adds.\nCyprus introduced net metering as pilot program more than six months ago. The program concerns selected governmental buildings and a few communities only. Its goal was to gain significant experience and knowledge on how to run the electricity grid using net metering.\nA debate in the Cypriot Parliament in October 2012 concluded that the mechanism is vital, in order to reduce fuel poverty and promote economic development in the small country. However, the recent economic crisis seems to have triggered large-scale application of the mechanism as a way to boost economic activity.\nNet metering has been successfully applied in countries including Belgium, Denmark and Italy. In Italy, many photovoltaic associations recently asked the Government to allow the application of net metering for systems larger than 200 kW. In particular, Italian PV associations Gifi, Assosolare and Aper suggest that applying net metering to systems up to 1 MW would boost PV development in harsh times.\nUN's Cyprus PV system\nIn other news, the United Nations' Development Program (UNDP) in Cyprus installed a 15 KW photovoltaic system at its offices. The park cost US$ 30,000 and is now connected to the grid.\nEdited by Becky Beetz.\nThis content is protected by copyright and may not be reused.

{"id": "3607", "text": "How can I get a girly voice?\nRaising the laryngeal cartilage raises your pitch and creates a more feminine sound. Dropping the laryngeal cartilage drops your pitch and creates a more masculine sound. To speak in a lower voice, do exercises to relax your throat, like yawning or opening your mouth really wide from top to bottom.\nWhat are the signs of vocal nodules?\nSigns of Vocal Fold Nodules and Polyps\n- a “rough” voice.\n- a “scratchy” voice.\n- a harsh-sounding voice.\n- shooting pain from ear to ear.\n- feeling like you have a “lump in your throat”\n- neck pain.\nIs straining your voice bad?\nOveruse and pressure on the voice can lead to different problems within your vocal cords. Over time, if you keep straining your voice, this could lead to vocal nodules or polyps. Nodules on the vocal cords are a bit like the callouses that build up on your fingertips when you play guitar.\nHow do I change your voice?\nChange Your Google Assistant’s Voice On an Android Phone\n- Press and hold the Home button (or say “OK Google”);\n- At the bottom right tap the small compass icon;\n- Tap your user icon in the upper right corner of the screen;\n- Tap Assistant Settings;\n- Tap Assistant;\n- Tap Assistant voice;\n- Choose your voice from the list of options.\nHow do you talk high pitch?\n- How to Make Your Voice Sound Higher.\n- Focus on Your Breathing.\n- Listen to Yourself.\n- Remove All Blockages.\n- Embrace Your Nasal Voice.\n- Fix Your Posture.\n- Master Your Pitch.\n- Make Your Voice Higher by Owning It.\nHow do you describe your voice quality?\nGuttural – Deep and made at the back of your throat. High-Pitched – Very high and shrill. Hoarse – Low rough voice, usually because their throat is sore. Husky – A husky voice is deep and sounds hoarse often in an attractive way.\nHow do you talk without straining your voice?\nAvoid using the extremes of your vocal range, such as screaming or whispering. Talking too loudly and too softly can both stress your voice. Practice good breathing techniques when singing or talking. Support your voice with deep breaths from the chest, and don’t rely on your throat alone.\nWhat is an example of a high pitch sound?\nEvery sound has two parts: frequency (also called pitch) and intensity (or loudness). A bass drum, thunder, and a man’s deep voice are low- frequency sounds. A high-pitched whistle, squeal, and a child’s voice are high-frequency sounds.\nCan singing high damage your voice?\n2. Chronic vocal fatigue. Vocal fatigue can result from overuse of the voice. Overuse can damage the vocal cords, and if you often find you have lost your voice by the end of the day or after an hour of singing, your vocal cords may be experiencing tissue damage.\nHow can I have a cute voice?\nVoice training exercises\n- Yawn. Yawning will help stretch and open the mouth and throat, as well as relieve tension from the neck and diaphragm.\n- Cough slightly.\n- Make slight lip vibration.\n- Tighten all your muscles to teach your body to relax while singing.\n- Singing with a closed mouth is another way to warm up your voice.\nWhat is a feminine voice?\nWhen I speak of feminine voice, what I refer to is a state of being, more than a “sex” or “gender”. It’s a quality that bypasses the intellect, so it’s really hard to put into words. Less is More. I refer to feminine voice as an energy which is soft, yielding, nurturing and nourishing. It is deep and quiet.\nWhat voice strain feels like?\nWhat Are the Symptoms of Vocal Strain? Here are the main symptoms of vocal strain: Coughing and hoarseness. Those suffering from vocal strain may experience symptoms like hoarseness, a sore throat, or a persistent, tickly cough.\nHow do you fix a strained voice?\nSome self-care methods and home treatments may relieve the symptoms of laryngitis and reduce strain on your voice:\n- Breathe moist air.\n- Rest your voice as much as possible.\n- Drink plenty of fluids to prevent dehydration (avoid alcohol and caffeine).\n- Moisten your throat.\n- Avoid decongestants.\n- Avoid whispering.\nWhy does my voice crack when I sing?\nThe reason your voice cracks when you’re singing is because of the incapacity of your vocal folds to vibrate at the pitch you desire when trying to sing a sound, no matter how much you force it.\nHow do you know if you’re straining your voice while singing?\n#1 Use Your Eyes to SEE if You are Straining Your Voice When You Sing. A big tattle teller of strain is if you can SEE the muscles on your throat tighten. This is a clear sign of strain. Another visual sign of strain is if you are locking your jaw and tilting your head back when you sing.\nHow do you know if you have damaged your vocal cords?\nSigns and symptoms of vocal cord paralysis may include:\n- A breathy quality to the voice.\n- Noisy breathing.\n- Loss of vocal pitch.\n- Choking or coughing while swallowing food, drink or saliva.\n- The need to take frequent breaths while speaking.\n- Inability to speak loudly.\n- Loss of your gag reflex.", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}

{"id": "3641", "text": "CARLYLE - For several years, residents of Carlyle have been aware of the need to replace and improve its aging infrastructures.\nEstablished in August, the Carlyle Community Complex Foundation was incorporated as a non-profit organization. Its goal is to operate a foundation focused on bringing the community together to establish fundraising programs. The money will be used to continue to maintain capital funds required for the life of a pre-kindergarten-Grade 12 school and community support centre.\nA board has been formed which will bring the community of Carlyle together, identifying needs with common goals. Their priorities are daycare services, upgrading the schools, a shared use of partnerships, and inclusion of sports, recreation, cultural and community event space.\nJared Riddell is an advisor to the board.\n“In September 2021, select citizens of Carlyle had a private meeting with the mayor and reeves of Carlyle and area as well as council members and school staff. We discussed the needs in our area and shortly thereafter were invited by Andy Dobson of the South East Cornerstone School Division to tour the new Legacy Park School in Weyburn. That October, we boarded a van and had a tour of this brand-new facility,” Riddell said.\n“After much discussion with leaders of the school division, the Ministry of Education, MLA Daryl Harrison, and the Town of Carlyle, the advice given was to prepare our case. In December of 2021, a proposal was approved and delivered to all parties. When Premier Scott Moe visited Carlyle in August, I hand delivered him a copy of the proposal.\n“Architectural drawings, engineering and cost estimates were obtained, and several of us got together and formed a committee. It is important to be ready as we are extremely hopeful that a new facility is approved for Carlyle in the very near future.”\nFor the past two years, the town of Carlyle has appeared on the provincial government’s website as being a top-10 candidate for a new school which would combine the Carlyle Elementary and Gordon F. Kells High School facilities under one roof. A new school would also qualify for daycare facilities as at present, Carlyle does not have any daycare co-operatives registered.\nWhen a new school for Carlyle is announced by the Saskatchewan Ministry of Education, the foundation will be responsible for providing funding for any additional space requirements. After reviewing the costs of past builds, as well as calculating future needs, the foundation has determined the town will need $10 million to cover additional space requirements.\nThe source of these additional funds could be allocated as follows and are estimates only: 60 per cent municipal governments, 25 per cent programs and grants, 10 per cent corporate and other sponsors, and five per cent public donations and fundraising,\nTammie Riddell is the chairperson of the newly formed foundation.\n“Carlyle is a thriving community and not having a licensed daycare is a major concern. Additionally, our two schools require substantial renovations, and our memorial hall has a seating capacity of just over 200. When Carlyle gets notification of a new school, we must be ready, and we will be.\n“A new state-of-the-art school complete with day care will attract quality teachers, new families, and more businesses to our town. A new event centre is also an important part of our Foundation’s vision.”\nThe foundation recently elected their executive which consists of local parents and grandparents with a vision for Carlyle and its future needs.

Here in Belgium, spring has arrived and has brought along its bright colors, the delicate odours of blooming flowers, as well as the cheerful chirping of birds. I try to soak it all in as this is my favorite time of the year. On a related note, if we only looked closer, we would find gems of inspiration in the things around us. For me, nature is my personal and biggest gem. What’s yours?\nGreat color palette and love all the gradient mesh work in this illustration.\nSpark Of Science\nStill shot of short film. Beautiful perspective.\nPerfect Morning — Dark Hedges\nPerfect morning light at the Dark Hedges, Northern Ireland.\nOne part of a series of illustrations for the inaugural set of artwork launched for Facebook Event themes. Special color combination.\nBeautiful colours that are being used here. The eyes draw you in.\nSan Antonio Magazine\nLovely combination of type and illustrations. Beautiful extrude 3D effect too. It adds this perfect contrast.\nAdoring the simplicity of all this. Just the basics so that your mind fills in the rest.\nSummer Is Crazy\nThe special style of Sami Viljanto is an eye-catcher.\nPacking For Mexico\nSuch a great vibe due to the way the fills are done with this particular pencil stroke effect.\nMagnificent reproduction of the 1940s advertisement vibe. The entire piece was handpainted using digital paint brushes on a Cintiq tablet, and then a texture was applied created by an old, scratched up sheet of metal and a grain filter.\nPackaging illustration for 7 flavour designs for Smashmallow, all natural, organic sugar, gluten-free marshmallow snacks. The others are lovely too. Make sure to check them out!\nCan’t Hide, Kampina\nVery nice capture! A scenery that I always hope to encounter too when I’m out on my bicycle.\nThe Night Ocean\nWhat a great book cover! Brilliant usage of lines that translate the title so well.\nA warm atmosphere in this illustration. Great patterns on the dresses and brilliant colors that suit the mood. The threat is hidden in the shape of the shadow. Very clever.\nHearts In Atlantis\nInspired by the film of Stephen King’s best seller with the same name.

Such perfect soft blue tones to create the shapes of the ice.\nLove this subtly absurd and boldly colored illustration.\nI See You\nThe little details that make this shine are the eyes that you see in the binoculars.\nStanford Medical Wellness\nBeautiful Pallet! Great textures too.\nAll the plants are so nicely executed. Also loving the female running and how the waves are drawn.\nSo much greatness in this.\nNice editorial image. The line drawings in the back are clever. Love this combo of styles.\nGreat job on the light effect by using (I assume?) the moon as the light source and the use of white and black for the shadows. This high contrast effect is just perfect.\nCats Love Tables\nMaria’s intricately patterned illustrations made with a blend of colour pencils, markers, acrylic and watercolour on paper is what made me pick this one. The remarkable part is that she goes straight to paper without sketches. “I usually draw pretty quickly, I never prepare sketches, I go straight to the paper. I like it to be intuitive, to feel that the hand is almost possessed and drawing by itself, not letting the head think about every movement.”\nGreat for studying the texture and patterns usage. Beautiful retro style too!\nGreat idea to fill the figure with a square grid. Fits perfectly with all the other ‘sharp’ elements.\nSo much energy in this illustration. Great colors as well.\nWouldn’t mind having a go at this pinball machine created by Ellen Schofield. Such beautiful details!\nAnother lovely poster from Scott Hansen.

Additional external sources of information are not needed for this task and there are no marks associated with using additional resources, i.e.always work with the unit texts and resources first.\nQuestion 1: Crisis versus Disaster\n(a) The IRACI (Identify, Report, Assess, Communicate, Implement) tool is a crisis communication planning framework used to manage an incident. The key elements of the IRACI tool are as follows:\nIdentify: Identify the incident and activate the response plan.\nReport: Report the incident to the appropriate individuals and teams.\nAssess: Assess the situation to determine the scope and impact of the incident.\nCommunicate: Communicate the incident to all relevant stakeholders.\nImplement: Implement the response plan to mitigate the incident.\nFor example, if there is a data breach at Nike Inc., the IRACI tool can be applied in the following manner:\nIdentify: Identify the data breach and activate the incident response plan.\nReport: Report the data breach to the appropriate individuals and teams.\nAssess: Assess the scope and impact of the data breach to determine the extent of the incident.\nCommunicate: Communicate the data breach to all relevant stakeholders, including customers and partners.\nImplement: Implement the response plan to contain the data breach and prevent further damage.\n(b) Another strength of the communications planning approach outlined in HB292-2006 is the importance of clear and concise messaging. Effective communication during a crisis is essential, and the messaging should be tailored to the audience. For example, if there is a product recall, the messaging should be clear and concise, providing customers with specific details about the recall and any actions they need to take.\nQuestion 2: BIA and Disruption Scenarios\n(a) Business impact assessment (BIA) is a process used to identify and prioritize critical business functions and processes and assess the potential impact of disruptions. Disruption scenarios are helpful in planning for a BIA as they help identify potential threats and their impact on critical business functions and processes. By analyzing disruption scenarios, organizations can determine the likelihood and impact of different types of disruptions and prioritize their response efforts accordingly.\n(b) A relevant example of a disruption scenario for Nike Inc. could be a supply chain disruption. In this scenario, there is a disruption to the supply chain that impacts the availability of materials or finished products. The benefits of disruption scenario planning are that it allows organizations to identify potential vulnerabilities and prioritize response efforts. For example, Nike could identify alternative suppliers or increase inventory levels to mitigate the impact of a supply chain disruption.\nQuestion 3: Recovery Objectives\n(a) A recovery objective or metric is a specific goal or target that an organization sets for its recovery efforts. Recovery objectives are used to measure the effectiveness of recovery efforts and ensure that critical business functions and processes are restored within a certain timeframe.\n(b) In the context of the disruption scenario and impact assessment described in Question 2(b), a recovery objective could be to restore supply chain operations within 48 hours of a disruption. By setting a recovery objective, Nike can prioritize its response efforts and allocate resources accordingly to ensure that critical supply chain operations are restored within the specified timeframe.", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

In late 2002, nearly half of the workers at the state oil company PDVSA went on strike, after which the company fired 18,000 of them, draining the company of technical knowledge and expertise.\nDid Biden ask Venezuela to produce more oil?\"It's really sad to see the way President Biden treats our domestic oil industry, while asking countries like Venezuela and Saudi Arabia to produce more oil,\" Robert Rapier, a chemical engineer with decades of experience in the energy industry, told Fox News Digital.\nHow much of Venezuela's economy is based on oil?Oil Is Major Part of GDP\nOil comprises 95% of Venezuela's exports and 25% of its gross domestic product (GDP), so high prices provide a boon to the country's economy.\nWhy Venezuela Is So Poor Despite Having So Much Oil\nWho buys the most oil from Venezuela?In 2021, Asia was the main region of destination for Venezuelan crude oil exports, with an average of 418 thousand barrels per day.

N) have bought cargoes from Chevron, according to U.S. Customs and shipping data.\nIs the US getting oil from Venezuela now?Chevron received an expanded U.S. license allowing it to resume production in Venezuela and to import the South American country's crude into the U.S. The decision allows Chevron to revive existing oil projects in the U.S.-sanctioned country and bring new oil supplies to refiners in the U.S.\nHow did Venezuela go from rich to poor?A once wealthy country, Venezuela's economy was driven into political and economic crisis by corruption and mismanagement.\nWas Venezuela ever a rich country?From the 1950s to the early 1980s, the Venezuelan economy, which was buoyed by high oil prices, was one of the strongest and most prosperous in South America. The continuous growth during that period attracted many immigrants.\nWhy is Venezuela oil so dirty?The quality issues stem from shortages of chemicals and equipment to properly treat and store the oil, resulting in shutdowns and slowdowns at PDVSA production facilities, along with hurried transporting to avoid late deliveries, the sources said.

The views and opinions expressed on this program are not necessarily those of the staff and management of WMTR. As always, it is advisable to consult a professional before making a major decision.\nIt’s time now for the Templar Real Estate Talk Show. Here’s your host for the program, Joseph J. Zoppi.\nJoseph J. Zoppi:\nHello. Welcome to the Templar Real Estate Talk Show. My name is Joseph J. Zoppi. A real estate investor, consumer advocate, author, and managing partner of Templar Real Estate Enterprises. You could reach us at templarcashforhouses.com. That’s T-E-M-P-L-A-Rcashforhouses.com, that’s one word. Or you could call us at 973-240-8593. Again, that’s 973-240-8593. We could answer any questions you may have, or you could email us from our website as well. Ask any questions or if you want something discussed on this radio show, we’d be more than happy to try and accommodate you.\nFor first-time listeners, my company is a real estate investment firm. We buy houses for cash. We purchase apartment buildings. We do joint ventures with other real estate investors. We loan money for rehabs. We provide transactional and gap funding as well. We work with individuals that wanna invest with us in single-family houses up to apartment buildings. We do not speculate. We’re very protective of our money and our investors’ money. We’re not a brokerage and I’m not a real estate agent. But I have individuals on staff that could sell your house through the Traditional Multiple Listing Service. This show’s gonna go over everything there is about real estate and those things that impact real estate. We’ll talk about our rehabs, some of our investments, what went well, what did not go well, and how we compensated for that. We’ll talk about the economy and interest rates. We’ll discuss trends in the real estate market. Real estate is one of your biggest investments, so it’s important you know as much as possible about it. I’m gonna provide you with my opinion. It’s only my opinion. I ask everyone to do a lot of research and make sure you turn over all those stones. Peel back the onion as they say, all the other clichés about different things, but specifically about this. Make sure that you just do a lot of homework. Again, as always, I’ll say it every time, you read an article on the internet, make sure you realize the perspective of the author. That is the biggest thing. I read two articles this week. One said the house and market boom is over. And the other one says, the house and market boom is not over until 2023. So I don’t know. You know, someone could say one person’s right over the other. I have my own opinion on that, and we could talk about that a little bit today, hopefully. But again, you have to look at the perspective of the individual and what they want to convey. So they’re gonna obviously show you proof that something is a certain way. So when you do your research, you have to understand that. When you do your research for bringing someone on, providing a service, you gotta ask lots of good questions. I always prefer when someone does their homework and ask me a lot of questions. Because my statements are hopefully supported by their research.\nI had a gentleman that was going to… We’re gonna buy his house for cash. He lives in a really exclusive town. It’s a big house, it’s a fairly big house. About 3,000 square feet. It needed a lot of work. A lot of work. So I was gonna have to put a lot of effort into it. A lot of stuff in terms of HVAC. It was just gonna take a lot of rehab. And I was going over some of the stuff with him in terms of those cause. And I said also, one of the options is to list it. And I explained… He was on a little bit of a main drag and I told him, if he was like, on the side road, you probably get a 100,000 dollars more for the house. And these houses are expensive anyway. And he said, “Yeah. You’re right Joe.” Because he did a lot of research because he was disputing that with the township for the property tax. So he did an analysis and everything, but he did the homework. And it justified a number of statements that I made. So he felt more comfortable also with me because he could tell I was telling him the truth. And that’s a big factor. Because whoever it is goes into a new situation with a potential client, you’re not gonna trust that person for the most part. That’s the way it is. Some people are just very trusting, but most people are gonna have their guard up. And that’s understandable. And that’s why for us, we have great reviews. I have a background in terms of past work with managing large sums of money for the business that I was working for. And I’ve been interviewed for Forbes, Fox News, a number of different outlets as well as… I’m on the Forbes Real Estate Council. So again, all those things stack up to something that’s just, I’m not a flyby knight, We’re not a flyby knight. We have a great reputation and that’s what we make sure that we want to keep, always a good reputation.\nI’d like to do a quick shout out to a couple of our favorites that I always talk about. And of course, that’s Paulette, a famous Crossing Guard from Livingston. As well as Tim from City Grove Water Department. We have a couple of new listeners that had called me. One is Susan G, and her husband John G. So hey guys, welcome to listening and thank you very much for all the kind words that you have given me.\nSo coming up, one of the things that I’m gonna be doing is, I’m going to a conference in a Mastermind that I belong to. And we always share ideas with the top 150 flippers in the country. And we share our horror stories and what’s going good, what is not going well. And we learn from each other. What I’m gonna be doing is, I’m gonna have one individual from my company attending that. And there’s another Mastermind going on for a large multi-family property. So I’ll be attending that one. And again, we spend, I spend just on myself, probably close to at least 60,000 dollars on different types of education annually. And that’s the only way we stay ahead of the curve. So that’s very, very important to us. And see what the emerging trends are. Especially when we’re looking at it from a national perspective. So you look at things locally, but you also have to look at them from a national perspective. I say that all the time. Because certain parts of the country might turn to the downside or upside, it depends what it is. Depends on what time of year where you are in the life cycle of anything, especially real estate. And you see what’s going on, so then you could prepare accordingly. The areas that are the most expensive always turn down first. They always go down first. And then the other ones follow suit. So it’s always good that you have a pulse on it. I might have someone from LA or San Francisco saying “Yeah Joe. We’re having some challenges now selling houses. And we’re starting to see some problems. Or, “Now we’re still, everything’s doing well.” So we’ll see. Right now, Jersey of course is not, we’ll say the leader in terms of people flocking to the state. Usually, people are leaving the state more than coming to the state. And we’ll see how that impacts it. So we might be one of the first ones, or New York, or New Jersey, things like that as opposed to in the previous down-cycle where you had Las Vegas turn negative first, parts of California, parts of Arizona, things like that. So we’ll see and we always try to keep, like I said, a strong pulse on that. That’s very, very important to us. And seeing where everything’s going. We look at economic factors very closely. I have my Wall street Journal and I’m always looking at things. We’re always talking about that because we have large investments. And our goal is to get in and get out as quickly as possible. And right now we’re seeing a couple of towns that are concerning us a little bit. And we have a house in one of those. That will always make money. I’m not really concerned about that as much as how much money. So that’s the question. So we have one town, Long Valley. It seems things aren’t moving as quickly as we would like. I’ve seen a number of houses priced around our price range. Our house right now is not on the market. But we’re starting to see some reductions. And so, it’s a little bit of a concern to us. It might just because it’s July, August coming up. Not that summer is not a strong time but, might be just that. So many people are just beaten up by Covid, that they’re on vacation. They really don’t want to think about it, so on and so forth. A lot of families though, do like to shop in the summer for a house and be well-established before the kids go back to school, so they could start a new school. But we’ll see. Right now, the other trend is obviously, there’s a good with mortgage rates. The rates are still really good. So that’s a positive factor. But things have been brewing and I continue talk about inflation, things like that. So there is a concern on that side about that and how that’s gonna impact certain things. So we’ll see. But time will tell on that, but we’re looking very, very closely at inflation and where it is, and what’s gonna happen with that, and how that’s gonna impact everything from our multi-families that we’re looking at, to our single-family houses. We have individuals that are calling us. You know, they’re kind of concerned also saying, “We really want to sell our house. We want to put it on the market.” We work with both types of people. Those that need to sell their house fast for cash and those that do not, that say, “I’d like top-dollar and I’ll wait.” And that’s a good thing. But we cater to both types of clientele.\nWe have a number of things coming up. I had spoken about last week. I had a woman, she has a really nice house and it was inherited. They pulled the tank. The tank had insurance on it. And I don’t think I made that clear last time. I talked about insurance. But did not talk about that the tank had a posse on the tank in the event that it leaked. And it did leak. And it leaked bad. And it leaked into the groundwater. And she’s still cleaning it up. And she wanted me to come by. I was a little hesitant. And we’ll see. I said, we’ll see. And then after that, I made an appointment and I asked her more questions about the leak. And I wanted the report. And then she was getting a little cagey about that and a little worried. And I said, well, I have an environmental scientist that wants to look at it. And she wanted to know who it was, and so on and so forth. I’m not sure why, because he knows she doesn’t know the different companies out there. But I told her who it was. And then she was more hesitant and then I said, finally I said to her, how about we just cancel it? And I said to her, I said, I’m gonna do my due diligence. And she was, I guess a little naive, or I’m not sure what. Because she just assumed that I just go there, buy it, and that’s it. And that’s not the case. I still have to do my due diligence. And any person that’s gonna invest money should be doing that. And with that being said is, I look at the issues. I look at the risk. And then I price accordingly. If there’s extreme risk, like any wise investor, they’re not gonna get as much money. It’s just that simple. And for this situation, I was not gonna give her a lot, relatively speaking. But she would have came out of that and saying, “Oh, he could make so much money if he sells it at the top price.” And I’m gonna come out of that saying, well, I could lose X amount of dollars because I’m not gonna be able to sell it. So there’s two perspectives on it. So when I price something, like this, that’s very extreme in terms of an issue, I’m gonna price it accordingly, with the idea that I might lose the money. So I might lose 200,000 or 150,000 dollars based on this. Because it might not be sellable. Because no mortgage company’s gonna underwrite it. So all those factors come into play.\nSo let me close out this segment. Thank you very much. Again, you can call us at 973-240-8593, or templarcashforhouses.com. Thanks a lot and I’ll see you shortly.\nJoseph J. Zoppi:\nHello, welcome back to the Templar Real Estate talk show. My name is Joseph J. Zoppi, managing partner of Templar Real Estate enterprises. You could reach us at 973-240-8593. Again, that’s 973-240-8593, or templarcashforhouses.com. That’s T-E-M-P-L-A-Rcashforhouses.com, that’s one word. Again, if you need to sell your house fast, please give us a call. We could buy it for cash or we could list it through the Traditional Multiple Listing Service. Again there’s no obligation. We’ll go out. There’s no fees associated with it. We’ll give you a price. We agree upon the price. We’ll set a closing date. And then we’ll buy it as-is. It’s really pretty straightforward. The contract’s pretty straightforward too. We really don’t have too much pushback from any attorneys because of its simplicity. And we’re accepting all the risk. A lot of times we go into these houses, and even the owners don’t realize what’s lurking under things, behind walls, things like that. We open up walls, all of a sudden we have issues. Lot of times our budgets do get, go over definitely. That’s why one of the things I do like is condos, or townhomes because it’s somewhat limited to the walls inside the structure as opposed to outside the structure, which just adds additional complexity. And it just adds a lot to it. Even though you wouldn’t think so, it does. And that’s the problem. It’s just the additional complexity. We don’t have to worry about the outside. We don’t have to worry about the vinyl siding or the painting or the roof, or the grounds, or anything else associated with it. It’s really just the windows and what’s on the inside. So it’s pretty segmented and relegated to a certain area, which can control your expenses considerably. And that’s a good thing. But when we get some of these houses, all of a sudden we just open them up and it’s just, it’s one horror story upon another. We’re looking at one where the ceiling was sagging. And we’re like, we weren’t sure why it was sagging. And we started to open it up a little bit. And a previous contractor glued the sheet rock, or the drywall to the other drywall. And there was no nails really keeping it up. And then all of a sudden everything came down. So all of a sudden, something that we didn’t expect to be really fixing that much is all of a sudden, as a result of, a whole ceiling has to be replaced. So it’s just one thing upon another. And that happens a lot.\nSo one of the things that I’d like to talk about is really structuring deals and it’s always a dynamic process. I spoke about this one deal that we’re working on. It’s four parcels of property in different towns with five houses. So one parcel has two houses on it. And I said before that, a couple of them had underground tanks, or partially underground tanks. And we did some soil tests associated with it. And it came back where the, what they call the soil’s dirty. So it means that there’s some type of environmental issue. There’s one specifically has to do with oil in the soil. And it got some prices back to remediate that and that’s to remove the tank, as well as clean the soil. So basically, they’ll remove the soil, bring it an EPA site that’s designated, and then they’ll put fresh fill in. Before they do that, they’ll start pulling the soil out and then doing some tests and determine if the soil’s clean or not. And then if it is, they’ll fill it in. If not, then they’ll have to dig more out, so on and so forth. So, of this one deal that has four parcels, like I said, there’s two tanks that are buried, or one that’s half-buried. It’s underneath a porch. So it’s partially buried. And they’re leaking. We got prices back, approximately 13,000 dollars each. One is probably a little less. And I said straight up in the contract, I made it very clear, I said that, if there’s a problem with the tanks, we’ll have to discuss it. And we’re not really going to pay for it. But we’ll figure something out. And the situation is that, the gentleman, unfortunately, he doesn’t have any money to pay for that cleanup. So we said, we will do that. And we want to do it before we close. Because what might be 13,000 might not in the end be 13,000. It might be, I don’t know, 14,000. Not 14,000, maybe like 40,000. So we need to know what it really is beforehand. And if I told him 13,000, they gave me the 13,000 and then afterwards it was 40,000, well it’s gonna be hard for me to collect, easily. So I want this resolved sooner. In addition, if, like I said in the previous broadcast, if it hits groundwater, that could cause a lot more issues. So I want to clean it beforehand to understand what my total exposure is. So as result of that, I had to figure out a good way of crafting this addendum, which my attorney would eventually write up. But I had to figure this out. So we had a couple of options. The first option is that, I do the work and whatever it is, it is. And if we decide not to close on the house because of the environmental damages, we’re gonna put a, it’s called a UCC lien on it. And when he did sell it, I would get the money. That’s one option. The other option is that we would not buy the house. So that’s a possibility. But at what point? So the way we decide it, and the way I figured out to craft it is this, is that we would do the initial remediation. We will continue with it until it got to a point, in the event this happens, that we will continue to clean it. And if it became at a point where it was just, we feel this cause prohibitive. And I don’t really know what that number is to be honest. Because it wasn’t gonna come out of our pocket in the end. But if I didn’t see any light at the end of the tunnel, then that would be an issue. Like I said, with that one woman that had the tank and it went into the groundwater. And she doesn’t know when that was gonna be cleaned up. It could be done in five years. So under that type of scenario, I would have probably just walked away with it. But I already spent the money, so I did not really want a lien on that property because who knows if it would ever be sold. So what we said is that, we would buy the other two properties and once those properties are sold, it would come out of their proceeds. The other thing that we would do, is because we’re using lines of credit, we do have to put some money up. It’s like 10% approximately. So what we would do with that is, we would purchase the property at the price that we had stated. And then we would get a check for the cleanup. And the reason we would do it that way as opposed to reducing the price of the property, at the end, when we would close, is because the money that was expended for the cleanup, that’s just cash that comes out. And cash is king. So we always want to preserve our cash and use lines of credit where we could. So we would purchase it at that price that we stated. And then we would get a check back and that would reimburse us for the money. So that’s the way that we would do it. And again, that would save us in the end. Because then we have our cash and we could do more deals, or whatever the case may be. Any investor that says that they have unlimited funds or so on and so forth. That’s just not possible. They might be well-funded, and we’re well-funded. But to say that, you can just spend money and spend money, that’s crazy. It’s just like a bank. Even banks have to have certain limits in terms of, based on branches and things like that, about what their reserves are, and how they spend the money. It’s just the way it is. So we make sure that we keep reserves. Make sure we’re very strong financially, so we cover everything that comes up and those things that don’t come up. So that’s why we look at deals. When we look at them, we structure them a certain way because of that. So with this one, we will say that the first house that we closed on with him that we will get, from the proceeds, we will get to cover our remediation. Now if we close before the remediation starts, that money goes into Escrow, for the estimated amount plus, I had it like, 10,000 more, or something like that. So we could get reimbursed as soon as we expend the money. And he needs to sell, I don’t know if there’s some issues. There’s some issues with that. I’m not sure why he needs to sell, but he’s very, very anxious to sell. The one house that has the oil tank, the house is burned down basically. And it’s underneath the porch. So it’s half underground, and half not. It’s above the ground. And I think someone died there because there was a cross outside. I think he’s very anxious about that one. There’s some suit going on. So I’m not sure what’s going on with that. And I don’t ask those questions. I don’t need to ask those questions. He’s coming to me to fix his problem. That’s what I do. Sometimes I’ll ask, just to get a general idea to help with the solution. But he’s a private person so I’ll just leave it at that. But we’re here to help. So we’re here to help in sticky situations. We’ll put it at that. Very, very sticky situations.\nWell I’m gonna have to close out today. Again, have a nice weekend. God bless. Take care and everyone be safe please.

It specializes on packing and shipping medical products. It will be in charge of providing storage, repackaging and distributing the Sinovac COVID-19 that will be arriving from China.\n2 million doses is expected to be delivered to Thailand from the Chinese firm. The first batch, consisting of 200,000 doses, will arrive by Wednesday next week.\nA further 800,000 doses will follow in March, while a million more will be arriving in April.\nThe first 200,000 doses will be distributed and administered to recipients in 10 provinces. These provinces are, namely, Samut Sakhon, Bangkok, Nonthaburi, Pathum Thani, Samut Prakan, Rayong, Chon Buri, Chanthaburi, Trat and Tak.\nAs previously reported, each recipient will need two doses of the COVID-19 vaccine. The second dose will follow two weeks after the first dose is administered.\nGPO Managing Director Withoon Danwiboon said that they will take a week to ensure the quality of the vaccines, and then distribution will commence. The quality assurance process will be undertaken by the Department of Medical Science, after which the GPO will provide DKSH a list of destinations for the vaccines.\nMr. Withoon assured residents in remote areas that they will receive the vaccine.\n“All deliveries will be made, even if they are in remote areas,” he said.\nHe also revealed that DKSH had offered to make deliveries for free for the two million doses that will be arriving in the next three months.\nDKSH will store the first 200,000 doses in its Bang Na district warehouse in Bangkok.\nWhen the vaccines arrive via Suvarnabhumi Airport, they will be processed by an inter-agency team consisting of officials from Customs, the Food and Drug Administration and the GPO. The teams will be working together to facilitate the speedy clearance of the vaccine shipments so that DKSH can then transport the vaccines to the target warehouse.\nThe GPO said that they expect to clock 30 minutes only for the clearance event for the vaccines.\nTo ensure safety and efficacy, the Sinovac vaccines will be stored at temperatures of at least 2 degrees and up to 8 degrees Celsius.\nAccording to earlier reports, the Ministry of Public Health is aiming to vaccinate five million people a month, which means 2 million doses per month. Dr. Sophon Mekthon, who has been placed in charge of the vaccination program, said that this will be an “unprecedented challenge” for the Ministry.\nAstraZeneca was due to send in the initial batch of doses to start the government’s immunization program, but measures passed by the European Union had blocked the imports of vaccines from the company’s Italian manufacturing facilities.\nAstraZeneca and Siam Bioscience had earlier entered into a transfer of technology agreement that will allow Thailand to locally produce the vaccines, an undertaking which will begin in June.", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

{"id": "3764", "text": "Once upon a time, there was a house.\nA little prairie house.\nIt was born in 1918, a homesteader’s dream, built to shelter a growing family from the harsh conditions of the high plains.\nIt’s seen a lot in the past 98 years.\nLightning strikes. Blinding snowstorms. Rattlesnake infestations. A shop fire. Tornadoes. The Blizzard of ’49. And relentless wind. Oh, the wind.\nMany families came and went after the original family left. There were some who loved the little homestead, and planted lilacs and Siberian Elm trees carefully in rows behind the house to protect it from the pounding west winds. They raised sheep and cattle, and candled their eggs in the tiny hand-dug basement. Each spring a lone tulip can still be found rising from the middle of the yard where their flower beds once stood.\nBut as the years rolled along and the homestead continued to change hands, it slowly fell into disarray and began to lose its shine.\nThe fence lines crumbled. The outbuildings weathered and slowly fell apart. The windmill atop the original well was torn down. Gaping holes were dug in the yards and pastures in an effort to bury the ever-accumulating trash, and during the worst years, a small horse lived inside the house.\nThe shop and barn were waist-deep in junk. There was a washing machine in the back pasture. The carefully planted trees filled the back yard with broken limbs as they aged, shattered, and died. Bits of clothing, carpet, and assorted trash seemed to grow from the prairie as the wind blew the soil from the hastily filled dump holes. No one wanted to live in such a tumble-down shack, so it stood empty for several years. Until…\nThese crazy people walked onto the property one day.\nThat’s us. (Way back when.)\nPeople tried to talk us out of buying it– they told us were were nuts. And as I look back at some of the photos, I see their point. The house was tiny, the outbuildings were trashed, the fence lines were destroyed, and it was miles and miles from the nearest grocery store. But we were blinded by potential, and couldn’t hear the naysayers whispering in our ear. Plus, we were newlyweds with a determination to live within our means and budget, and choosing the minuscule 900 square foot house meant two former-city kids could afford to become the proud owners of 67 acres. 67 glorious acres.\nSince the day we signed our names on the dotted line, this house has been much more than “just a starter home” to me. As someone who prayed for and craved country living since the age of three, buying this property was the realization of a longing that is so deeply ingrained in me I can describe it as nothing less than divinely inspired. It may sound strange, but I have a soul-connection to this land.\nOver the last 8 years, Prairie Husband and I have become ‘sweat equity’ personified, but it has been a labor of love. We overhauled every single inch of the place (fence lines, gardens, pastures, landscaping, tree rows, siding, roofs, outbuildings, corrals, you name it…), EXCEPT the house.\nThe good news was that the previous owner gutted the entire interior of the tiny house, so the inside had new sheetrock and flooring. The bad news was he had a “builder-grade” sort of style, so the house sadly lost much of its original character and ended up rather bland and uncharming (hello yellow plastic siding…). But it was clean and livable and it worked just fine for a while as we toiled away on our outside projects.\nBut then the babies started coming. And our home business grew. And the little 900 square foot prairie house suddenly got REALLY REALLY SMALL.\nAnd we knew it was time for the last piece of the 100-year old homestead rebirth to fall into place. It was time to add on.\nRemodeling was brutal. You can read all about our planning/demo/building process in this post. We tore off several rooms in the process, so our tiny house got even smaller for a while, and we found ourselves eating/living/schooling/relaxing in just one room for many, many months. More than once the Prairie Husband had to talk me off the ledge when I was sure I just couldn’t take the chaos for one more second. But all seasons come to an end, and hallelujah, that one is OVER.\nIt’s time for the big reveal today, my friends. I know many of you have been waiting a while for this, as I’ve been dropping sneak peeks on Facebook and Instagram for months. Is it entirely finished? Well, no. (Will it ever be? Probably not.) But I’m not going to make you wait any longer.\nSo without further adieu, may I present to you: the neglected and forgotten little prairie house made new.\nThe Story of Our Prairie House (in pictures)\nA shot from summer 2008, right after we purchased the property. The canvas camp chair lends a super classy touch– don’t you think? 😉\nSpring 2015– we tore off the dining room and “laundry closet” on the back of the house and prepared to dig the giant hole in the back where the new addition would go.\nWhen we ripped off the lovely plastic yellow siding, we discovered many of the boards underneath were rotted and the insulation was almost non-existent. So we had to take a detour and replace boards and install insulated panels before we could proceed with the new siding.\nBut this is what we look like now:\nWe still have a tiny bit of siding to finish on that one side, and I need to paint one more white door, but it’s quite the transformation, I think.\nWe agonized over siding choices for months, but we finally went with cedar siding with a steel wainscot. The wainscoting will naturally rust over time and I love the industrial/rustic feel it brings. Plus I can’t hurt it with the weed whacker.\nThe same tree– approximately 7 years later. (And no, trees do NOT grow fast here in Wyoming…)\nOld Dining/New Laundry Room:\nThis was our old dining room, aka the dining “closet”. We added the window in 2014, but even then, it was still an awkwardly small room. The ceilings were short and crooked, and even a small dining table and chair set would barely fit. Entertaining guests was super-duper cozy. Ahem.\nIn order for the foundation of the new addition to fit on to the back of the house, we had to complete rip off this room. However, we rebuilt it on the original footprint (on the new foundation, with straight walls and ceilings…) moved the door, and turned it into the new laundry room.\nHard to believe it’s the same space, huh?\nI went a little nuts with quirky additions to the laundry room, so I wrote a entire post with all the juicy details. You can find all of that (along with the name of my “heifer head”) in my farmhouse laundry room post.\nThis was the kitchen right after we bought the place. Builder-grade oak cabinets, no dishwasher, and extremely limited counter space. (By the way– my decorating style has changed considerably since then… thank goodness.)\nIn 2012, I got the wild idea to paint those builder-grade cabinets white (and we’d also installed an island and dishwasher and moved the sink by then, too).\nI loved the white look for quite a while– it felt airy and crisp. And then I had Prairie Boy and suddenly my white cabinets weren’t so white anymore (the kid is pretty much a walking ball of stickiness), and the cheap-o cabinets began to fall apart, too.\nThankfully, the kitchen was right on the edge of where the old house met the new house, so it needed to be redone anyway. Once the remodel was “dried-in”, we ripped apart the kitchen too. Fun times.\nAs is common with old houses, the kitchen floor was pretty saggy. So saggy, in fact, that we likely could not have laid down the new wood floor without major issues. Thankfully, Prairie Husband is extremely handy and was able to jack up the house and build in extra support in the ancient basement underneath. It was an adventure, to say the least. But now our new floor is as level as you can expect a 98-year old house to be.\nI’m pretty sure there’s some rule somewhere that says farmhouses *must* have white painted cabinets, but I’ve never been very good at following rules, so I opted for rustic hickory instead (partly because I’d already done the white thing, and partly because I couldn’t take the dirt anymore…)\nSpeaking of decorating styles, I have no idea what mine is… If I had to put a label on it, I’d call it eclectic-rustic-farmhouse-vintage-western-industrial. How’s that for some classification? While I like some aspects of the all-white farmhouse look, I still crave a lot of rich, natural tones and texture. I love rusty metal, leather, cowhide, richly grained wood, and natural elements. As much as I love to look at the crisp white farmhouses on Pinterest, I knew using that much white in my decor just wouldn’t fit me. Plus, I wanted my house to have a uniquely Wyoming feel. (More on that in a bit).\nI wouldn’t have gotten this pot filler above the stove if it hadn’t been for Prairie Husband, but I’m sure glad he talked me into it– I love this thing. Super handy for filling up canning pots, too.\nMy first choice for counter tops was butcher block, but considering how messy I am in the kitchen, I decided it would be wiser to go with a material that doesn’t require quite as much maintenance. We opted for a grey quartz with a “fractured” edge, and I am loving it so far. It almost has a concrete look, and it’s super tough.\nI requested the open shelving specifically as a place to store some of my dry ingredients and home-canned food. I’m not really into “knick-knacks”, but I love using functional items as decoration.\nThe Living Room:\nOur old living room was painfully awkward, and it was one of the main reasons we needed to build the addition. It was a tiny box with awkward furniture placement, which made entertaining guests near impossible. (See the pics of it below) We decided to turn it into an office space instead, and build a spacious living room in the addition.\nHardwood floors were a must for our new living area, as I have dealt with carpet for FAR too long. We knew we wanted an open room with high ceilings and lots of natural light and seating for guests. I wanted this room in particular to have a bold, vintage Wyoming look, and I love how we were able to incorporate elements of our style into some of the trim work to make that happen.\nI especially love the window trim– we distressed 2×6 pine boards with a draw knife, hammers, and chains, and then stained them a dark brown. Prairie Husband added the big black bolts for an extra rustic touch, and the result is stunning. No curtains for these babies.\nI really wanted a taller baseboard trim (to mimic what I’ve seen in older homes) so we used 2×6 pine again, but this time with the top edge routered and stained to match the windows and doors as well.\nPrairie Husband custom-built the sliding barn doors to hide the TV. I know, I’m pretty spoiled.\nWe moved our wood stove from the old living room into this new room. But instead of the faux stone we used previously, we lined the stove surround with leftover steel from the exterior wainscoting, and use grey pavers for the base.\nI love this wall– the door was salvaged from our barn when we redid it, the antelope mount was from one of the Prairie Husband’s hunts, and the rope is a real rawhide reata that was my great-grandfathers. I love decor with a story.\nAnd then we have the windmill… If you follow me on Instagram, then you’ve probably already seen the windmill, and I’ll probably forever be known as the crazy-windmill-lady because of it, but I don’t care. It’s absolute perfection. It was generously “donated” from the junk pile of one of the ranches down the road.\nIt hangs over the stairwell wall that leads down into the basement. The half-wall is covered with leftover windbreak wood we had hanging around in our trash pile.\nThe Old Living Room/Office\nThis was our tiny living room, circa 2008. (Ain’t that maroon chair a beaut?) The carpet looked decent back them, but it didn’t look so great when we pulled it out 8 years later. Let me offer an unsolicited bit of advice: if you’re considering putting carpet in your homestead house– don’t.\nLittle did I know the original hardwood floors lay waiting for me under that speckled Berber…\nThis was a day or two after we made our hardwood floor discovery, prior to repainting. It definitely wasn’t all pretty and shiny when we initially pulled up the carpet, but I knew there had to be something worth saving under the scuffs and scratches and dried paint.\nTurns out, I was right.\nA trip to town to get a drum sander, a coat of stain, and two coats of sealer later, we were in business! If only these floors could talk…\nWe couldn’t find any desks we liked, so Prairie Husband (have I mentioned how handy he is?) built a custom wall desk made from rough cut windbreak wood planks. He planed it, joined it, sanded it, and rubbed in several layers of tung oil until it looked like this:\nPretty snazzy, eh?\nI love the industrial-look of pipe, so the supports are fashioned out of regular ol’ pipe, painted black. And there’s open shelving to match, of course.\nI’ve had a home business since 2011, and this is the first time I’ve ever had an actual office space.\nThe decor and details in here are still a work-in-progress, but it’s coming together. And I love not having my laptop and planner in the middle of my kitchen workspace…\nNew Master Suite\nOur old master bedroom was a typical, tiny, old-house bedroom– nothing special– so we gave our old room to the Prairie Kids, and build a new master suite off the side of the new living room.\nIt’s spacious and airy–which is a big improvement from our other room.\nOriginally we were going to go with a basic shower insert in the master bathroom, but it just looked too…. modern. So, we chose a weathered wood-look tile for the tub and shower. The only problem with that was Prairie Husband had to build the entire shower base and surround from scratch. Did I mention he’s pretty handy? If I had to do that, there would be water leaking through the floor into the basement as we speak, but he did an amazing job.\nThe pebble tile completes the natural look. (This photo is before we attached the glass door). It kinda cracks me up how much work we went through to make it look like you’re showering outside behind an old wooden windbreak, but I think it’s fabulous. 😉\nI love the old-fashioned look of the copper vessel sinks, and we also scrounged in our scrap pile to find old bits of weathered wood to complete the mirror, towel rack, and tile trim.\nThis lilac bush sits right next to the homestead’s original well and cistern; the old, broken pump jack is still nestled beneath its branches. I walk by it every day on the way to the barn, and each year when it blooms in the spring, I stick my face deep into the purple flowers, inhale, and give a silent nod to the generations of homesteaders who loved this little chunk of land before we did. I sure hope they like what we’ve done with the place.\n- Hardwood Floors: Handscraped Tobacco Road Acacia by Lumber Liquidators (this is the solid wood, not laminate)\n- Barn Door Hardware: artisanhardware.com\n- Windmill and Scottish Highlander Pillow Covers: society6.com\n- Main Paint Color: Westhighland White by Sherwin Williams\n- Office Paint Color: Lovely Bluff by Valspar\n- Trim/Door Stain: Jacobean by Minwax\n- Kitchen Pendant Lights: Barn Light Electric\n- Dining Room Chandelier: Decorsteals.com\n- Dining Room Table & Chairs: American Furniture Warehouse\n- Industrial-Look Ceiling Fans: Home Depot\n- Hammered Copper Farmhouse Sink: Sinkology\n- Copper Vessel Sinks in Bathroom: Sinkology", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

According to his Bandcamp page, the recording artist has been producing songs since 2013.\nAccording to New York Post, Petunin had previously served in the army and had been treated in a mental hospital, according to reports. Petunin said in a letter to his girlfriend that the sham “referendums” held by Russia last week resulted in annexing four regions of Ukraine – “everyone will go to the front lines.”\nHe continued, “People with psychosocial ailments even worse than mine are already being sent there without any hesitation.”\nAccording to New York Post, Many Russian men fled the warring country in droves or broke their own arms to avoid being recruited into military combat in the aftermath of Putin’s Sept. 21 address, which called for 300,000 reservists to be dispatched to battle.\nSince the announcement, around 2 lakh Russians have fled to neighbouring Georgia, Kazakhstan, and Finland, incurring 10-year prison sentences if apprehended.\nThe Kremlin built up makeshift draught offices near border checkpoints to catch draught evaders.", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

{"id": "3795", "text": "The Words of the Mickler Family\nReverend Dr. Sun Myung Moon with Sang lk \"Papasan\" Choi, one of the first Japanese Unification Church pioneers to America.\nBefore 1971, the Unification Church in America consisted of four independent missionary groupings: the \"Unified Family,\" a network of \"centers\" across the United States; United Faith, Inc., a string of \"chapels\" concentrated in the Pacific Northwest; HSA Arlington, Virginia related to the Korean Cultural and Freedom Foundation (KCFF); and the Re-Education Center in San Francisco. Each of the groups produced \"Divine Principle\" texts, established patterns of community life and developed distinctive ways of relating to American culture. Unfortunately, the groups were unable to unite. As a consequence, a national movement never emerged under the leadership of the Church's original missionaries.\nThis all changed in 1971. By far, the most significant factor in this was the decision of Reverend Moon to shift the focus of his ministry from Korea to the United States. He arrived on December 18, 1971 and over the next three years the rival missionary groups went out of existence, national membership multiplied exponentially, and the Unification Church emerged as a national movement in America. At the beginning of the year, one member characterized 1971 as \"the year of change for our Family.\" The Unified Family, led by Miss Young Oon Kim, flowed most naturally into the Unification Church of the 1970s.\nDr. David S. C. Kim and Miss. Young Oon Kim, enjoy an ice cream bar with Reverend Sun Myung Moon at a concession stand at Cow Palace, first day of a boat show, 1973.\nThe Unified Family, led by Miss Kim, flowed most naturally into the Unification Church of the 1970s. Her group made two decisive changes, one symbolic and the other substantive in 1971. First, the group changed its name from the Unified Family to the Unification Church; second, the group shifted its organizational strategy from a policy of \"unregulated expansionism\" to a policy of \"reconsolidation\" whereby they would consolidate \"from twenty-one small groups to five points of power -- Berkeley, Denver, Los Angeles, New York, and Washington.\"\nIn addition to spiritual activities, Miss Kim's group contributed to the Church's anti-communist work and its efforts to unite science and religion. Her group organized the Freedom Leadership Foundation (FLF) in 1969 and began publishing The Rising Tide, later billed as \"America's fastest growing freedom newspaper,\" in 1971. FLF generated additional organizations which opposed leftists on college campuses and developed contacts for Reverend Moon on Capitol Hill. Members also met a key contact who helped launch the International Conference on the Unity of the Sciences (ICUS).\nUnited Faith, Inc., or the \"Northwest Family,\" led by Dr. David S.C. Kim, laid the initial foundations for the Unification Church's later ecumenical and interfaith activity. More so than the other missionary groups, the Northwest Family had the consciousness of being a \"united faith movement.\" As early as 1963, they attempted to dialogue with Christian churches through \"Articles of United Faith\" based on Mr. Kim's vision of uniting Christian and Buddhist religions.\n(From left to right) Mrs. Hak Ja Han Moon, Mrs. Won Bok Choi, Mr. Young Whi Kim, first president of the Unification Church in Korea, and Mr. Won Pil Kim, one of the first missionaries sent to America.\nCol. Bo Hi Pak came to America in 1961 and two years later incorporated HSA-UWC Arlington, Virginia in 1963. In 1964, he was the moving force behind the creation of the Korean Cultural and Freedom Foundation (KCFF) which sponsored the Little Angels' performances in the United States. In 1966, he played a central role in establishing Radio of Free Asia (ROFA). In effect, Col. Pak became a free-lance ambassador of goodwill, foundation director, and an activist in the struggle against atheistic communism. He would later become Reverend Moon's special assistant and chief translator.\nSang Ik \"Papasan\" Choi's San Francisco-based Re-Education Center steadily grew and reached the height of its development in 1971. However, unlike Miss Kim who adopted a church-theological approach, Mr. Choi utilized a character-educational methodology. His method was especially effective in appealing to disaffected young people: he tapped directly into the communal ethos and utopian idealism of the 1960s. From 1966-71, Mr. Choi fashioned a successful communitarian experiment which included active witnessing, multiple centers, student groups, weekend workshops and an \"International Ideal City Project\" in Northern California.\nMr. Choi's group changed its name from the Re-Education Center to the International Re-Education Foundation in 1971. Along with the name-change, the group purchased a new headquarters at 44 Page Street, San Francisco allowing the community to engage in more ambitious projects. With a ballroom and balcony, Page Street headquarters also was well suited for a succession of \"International Friendship Banquets. One particularly elaborate affairs brought in 500 guests, a flag ceremony, speeches by San Francisco Mayor -- Joseph Alioto and the Honorable Piero Mustacchi, Vice Consul of Italy. Mr. Choi was named \"Man of the Day\" by a local radio station and the foundation was approved by the government as an acceptable substitute for the draft.\n410 Cole St., San Francisco served as the first church center for members in the San Francisco area.\nDespite its achievements, activities in America were peripheral to the mainstream Unification tradition, which was focused in Korea and, to a lesser extent, Japan. However, work there solidified to the point that the Church was ready to give serious attention to world mission. The most dramatic indications of this new direction were Reverend Moon's two world tours, the first in 1965 and the second in 1969. In 1965, Rev. Moon sanctified 120 \"holy grounds\" worldwide, including 55 in the United States, and four years later, sanctified 13 couples in the United States in the first Holy Marriage Blessing Ceremony ever conducted outside Korea. In December 1971, Reverend Moon returned to America as part of his third world tour. Although not apparent at first, this time he came to stay.\nAccompanied by Mrs. Moon, Mrs. Won Bok Choi, Mr. Young Whi Kim (President, HSA-UWC, Korea), and Mr. Ishii (Director, HSA-UWC Business Enterprises, Japan), the party arrived in Los Angeles, December 11, 1971. The group flew to Toronto, Canada, the following day, and on December 18, 1971, he arrived in Washington, D.C. Speaking almost every night from December 21st through the 30th, Reverend Moon assembled members for a four-day training program beginning Friday, December 31. During that weekend, details of Reverend Moon's \"Plan\" emerged to hold revival meetings in seven major cities including New York, San Francisco, and Los Angeles.\nThe Plan changed everything. It would require not only individual commitment but also the cooperation of all missionary groups. The seven-city campaign, the first of the \"Day of Hope\" tours, was the first project ever carried out by the entire Church. It gave substance to a united national movement based on Reverend moon's vision.\nMiss Young Oon Kim and the first members in front of the 1309 Masonic Ave. Church Center in San Francisco. Eight of the 12 in this group are still Unification Church members.\nIn this sense, it is appropriate to date the birth of the Unification Church of America from his arrival. Additionally, since Rev. Moon had never spoken publicly either in Korea or Japan, the birth of the American movement coincided with the beginning of a new phase in his ministry.\nThe year 1971 was indeed \"the year of change\" for the American Unification Church. The previous period had been a time of planting or, more accurately, transplanting. Although the accomplishments achieved prior to the 1970s were noteworthy, they paled in comparison with what was to follow. During the 1970s, when the wider society settled down to become the \"Me\" decade, the Unification movement exploded in America. However, the Church's phenomenal growth and the reactions it provoked are not finally comprehensible without the events of 1971 and how they functioned as a bridge between the Church's early mission and its emergence as a national movement in American life.\nDr. Mike Mickler is Professor of Church History, Unification Theological Seminary", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}

{"id": "3820", "text": "7-Year-Old Superhero Vanquishes Challenges to Achieve Amazing Eyesight\nDecember 21, 2022\nIvy Williams, 7, loves to read. One of her favorite books is Amazing Amber and Her Lazy Laser Eye, about a superhero who uses an eye patch to strengthen her vision, allowing her to shoot laser beams out of her eyes and defeat a pie-throwing villain.\n“I really want to be brave like Amazing Amber,” says Ivy, who was born with significant vision issues.\nBut here’s the truly amazing thing. To her parents and a team of doctors at the Division of Pediatric Ophthalmology at University Hospitals Rainbow Babies & Children’s, Ivy is a superhero, bravely persevering through multiple challenges to achieve near-perfect sight.\nTaking on Three Vision Villains\nIvy was born in 2015 with congenital ptosis in her right eye, which caused her eyelid to droop, blocking her vision. Her parents brought her to UH Rainbow when she was just eight days old. Before she turned one, she underwent five surgeries to adjust the position of her eyelid.\n“We timed her surgeries around her major motor milestones,” says her mother, Jennifer. “Before she was ready to sit up, stand or walk, she’d have a procedure to correct her vision to help her take that next step.”\nSoon after Ivy turned one, she was diagnosed with a related issue, strabismus, a misalignment of the eyes, which required another surgery.\nAs the UH Rainbow team of ophthalmologists, oculoplastic surgeons and optometrists worked to ensure the proper development of Ivy’s eyes, they were also managing an even more serious issue that had developed called amblyopia (‘lazy eye’). This occurs when there is a breakdown in the signals from the weaker eye to the brain. Over time, the brain can begin to rely more on the stronger eye, worsening the vision in the weaker eye.\n“The brain actually needs to learn how to see,” says Faruk Orge, MD, chief of pediatric ophthalmology at UH Rainbow, who first saw Ivy in 2018. “We have a critical period until eight or nine years of age to fully develop vision. If the eye is not functioning during this time, it fundamentally alters the learning capacity of the brain to interpret those images.”\nTreatment for amblyopia involves re-training the brain to force it to use the weaker eye by obscuring vision in the stronger eye. Ever since she was an infant, Ivy’s doctors had prescribed various methods to do this, including using drops in her stronger eye to blur her vision, or an eye patch to block her sight.\nThese methods became particularly challenging when Ivy got her first pair of eyeglasses and started school. But even though the temptation to remove her patch was strong, Ivy persevered. With her parents’ encouragement, and inspiration from Amazing Amber, she continued wearing her patch for up to 10 hours a day.\nBreaking the Glass(es) Ceiling\nBy the time she was four, the vision in Ivy’s right eye had plateaued at 20/100. Her cornea (the clear portion of the eye) had developed an irregular surface, distorting the light that entered her eye. A possible solution would be a rigid contact lens that would cover the surface of her cornea like a dome. But convincing a four-year-old to wear a contact lens is not easy.\nUH Rainbow optometrist Adam Peiffer, OD, MS, who first met Ivy in December 2019, took on the challenge with innovative methods and a lot of patience.\n“At first we just needed to get Ivy comfortable with the idea and feeling of putting a contact lens in her eye,” Dr. Peiffer says. He started with soft contacts with no prescription and eventually gave her contacts that corrected her right eye vision to 20/60.\nBy June 2022, Ivy was ready to take the next step. Dr. Peiffer used advanced equipment at the UH Rainbow Babies & Children’s PRISM (Pediatric Research and Innovation in Sight & Motility) Clinic and collaborated with SynergEyes, a California-based contact lens manufacturer, to help custom-design a hybrid contact lens for Ivy. The lens had a rigid center, which provides a smooth surface for light to enter, surrounded by a flexible “skirt,” which makes it more comfortable.\nTears of Pride\nJennifer remembers when Ivy received her new lens in the summer of 2022. “She immediately started seeing at 20/30,” she says. “My husband and I started crying because she had never seen that well. It was such a huge victory.”\nIvy had just one question. “Mom and dad, are you proud of me?” she asked.\nThey were. And so was Dr. Peiffer.\n“It took years of work by a multidisciplinary team of pediatric experts to ensure that Ivy developed good vision in both eyes,” he says. “It also took out-of-the-box thinking, advanced technology and the ability to offer dedicated time slots to work one-on-one with young patients. These are the kind of services and the culture that make UH Rainbow unique.” And Ivy herself did the rest of the amazing work!", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}

{"id": "3857", "text": "The growing integration of renewable energy into power grids across the region is increasing the need for greater system flexibility to ensure stable power output. Find out how hybrid power plants provide a solution that can meet these needs and become instrumental in the energy transition across Southeast Asia.\nIn this episode of Rethinking Energy in Southeast Asia, Avani Garg, Senior Financial Analyst, Middle East & Asia, Wärtsilä Energy, talks with Malin Östman, General Manager, Market Development & Strategy, Middle East & Asia, Wärtsilä Energy, about the value proposition and advantages of hybrid power plants, while discussing challenges and the way forward.\nWärtsilä first started developing the concept of hybrid power plants several years ago, however the increasing cost benefits of renewable energy and growing interest in renewable energy integration have made the case for hybrids even more compelling.\nAs Garg explains, “A hybrid is a combination of different power generation assets that can be co-located at the same plant or just within the same portfolio. For our discussion we would like to focus on a mix of renewables, gas-based generation and energy storage. But even within these three technologies there could be so many different combinations, leading to various types of hybrids.”\nGarg continues, “For example, you could have a hybrid with renewables and energy storage, where the battery is shifting power or smoothing out the fluctuation of renewables. You could have a thermal and energy storage hybrid where the battery is providing some spinning reserve, allowing the thermal assets to run more optimally. Or, you could have a combination of all three with renewables, thermal and some energy storage. For this discussion, we will focus on the last type of hybrid, where the grid-connected plant would be guaranteeing a specific capacity at any given time.’’\nWith the increasing penetration of renewables in power systems, the role of gas is also evolving. Gas has traditionally been used for baseload generation but is now taking on the role of balancing to mitigate the intermittency of renewables. With a hybrid power plant, renewables provide fuel-free, green energy and gas-based generation provides the balancing and generates the net load – this model allows each technology to take advantage of their strengths.\nAs Östman describes it, ‘‘In a hybrid you can co-optimise the balancing. Renewable and gas hybrids are, I think, a great case example of the future role of flexible gas balancing.”\nÖstman summarises the advantages of a hybrid plant as being an enabler for more renewables in the system, providing cheaper and more reliable power, and managing the balancing risk at a local level. Garg adds that hybrid power plants also allow for a future-proof grid as variable renewables are increasingly added to grids moving forward.\nIn terms of the economics, when looking at the levelised cost of electricity (LCOE), traditionally 70% of the costs in a baseload power plant are fuel costs, whereas with the hybrid model fuel costs only account for 30%. Hence, a hybrid power plant, besides having lower emissions from lower fuel usage, is also less vulnerable to volatility in fuel prices.\nGarg asks, ‘‘Why do you think we haven’t really seen this concept take off in Southeast Asia, in terms of actual projects yet?’’\nÖstman explains, ‘‘It's traditionally been hard to compete with the price of coal generation for firm power. But things are changing. Coal is becoming increasingly more difficult to finance. The recent news from China on this just proves the point.” China recently announced that they will stop building coal projects overseas, having been the last major source of coal power financing globally.\nÖstman continues, “Yet, Southeast Asia still has a growing power demand. I think this opens up the potential for hybrid power plants, which are more economical than baseload gas, yet with all the advantages of firm dispatchable power.\nAnother factor, I think, is the extent and speed of the energy transition. When you initially start adding renewable energy to the power system, balancing is not too much of an issue.\nIt’s when the amount of installed variable renewable energy grows that you start to feel the crunch in terms of having to cycle the other generation assets. Then you see the value and the need for flexibility.’’\nFrom a technical perspective the developer or supplier needs to be able to integrate all the different technologies and to correctly model and optimise the hybrid in terms of operations.\nFinally, another challenge that the hybrid concept needs to overcome is the lack of best practices and experience in the region regarding the procurement of hybrids. Östman says, “If it’s through a tender it needs to have the right requirements and evaluation criteria to match the need of the country and the power system, while still being technically feasible so as to attract bidders. If it’s through an IPP then structuring a hybrid PPA is necessary.”\nFor independent power producers (IPPs), it will be necessary to have a well-structured power purchase agreement (PPA), that addresses the additional complexity around the integration of assets, balancing of renewables, fuel consumption, and tariff mechanism. However, it is clear that the advantages of hybrids are worth the effort of getting these things in place.\nInitially it is important to develop a solid understanding of the business case and benefits within the industry, as well as having solid partnerships in the region that can bring the expertise necessary to deliver hybrid power plant projects. On a practical level, countries need to start piloting hybrid projects which will accelerate institutional learning and industry expertise.\nIn closing, Östman says, ‘‘I see Southeast Asia in general as a region that could really benefit from hybrid projects as a way to integrate more renewables but also as a region where hybrids are a competitive option, compared to some of the other generation options such as baseload gas power. In terms of countries, Philippines has a spot market, where their hybrids could be implemented in the form of a portfolio play by generation companies and utilities. But also countries such as Vietnam, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Cambodia are examples, where I think hybrids could add a lot of value.’’\nTo find out more about hybrid power plants, watch the full webcast above.\nInstalled energy storage is predicted to grow tenfold around the world in the coming decade, with 55% of that growth taking place in Asia Pacific. Find out what is driving this growth, as well as the challenges energy storage still faces in the region by listening to experts from Wärtsilä and the International Finance Corporation (World Bank).\nAs more countries across Asia prioritise decarbonisation and the integration of more renewable energy into their power grids, gas conversions of power plants are becoming an increasingly popular solution. Find out how gas converted power plants are helping to reduce emissions and provide the grid stability needed for energy transition across the region.", "scores": {"score": 3, "score_transform_1": 5, "score_transform_2": 5, "score_transform_3": 0}}

{"id": "3908", "text": "Petrol, hybrid and electric vehicles\nA petrol or diesel vehicle relies on an internal combustion engine (ICE) to run. An ICE burns the fuel we put in our cars to ignite the engine.\nA hybrid vehicle is powered by an ICE and an electric motor. ICE burns fuel to create electricity that charges the battery in the vehicle. This means that a hybrid vehicle requires less fuel to run than a conventional petrol or diesel car.\nAn Electric Vehicle (EV) does not have an ICE. Instead, an EV has an electric motor and a battery. When you charge an EV, the battery stores the electricity. Hybrid and electric vehicles are better for the environment because they need less to no fuel to run and produce less carbon emissions.\nCharging your EV\nEVs can be charged:\n- at home using the 3-pin plug that is included when you buy the vehicle. This method of charging is convenient but comes with the risk of overwhelming a standard domestic socket\n- at a dedicated charging point. These chargers are standalone units that you can install anywhere in your home. Home chargers are best used as an overnight charger because they are slightly slower\n- at fast charging points, which can be found at public car parks, workplaces, and supermarkets. These units are designed for a quick top-up charge. You need to use your own charging cable when using fast charging points\n- by using a rapid charger, which is the fastest way to charge an EV. Rapid chargers have a charging cable attached and can fully charge an EV in an hour. These chargers are located at:\n- Red Houses car park\n- Long Beach car park\n- Jersey Electric on Queens Road\nIn Jersey you can park and charge your electric car using Evolve charging points. Jersey Electricity provides these charging points across the Island.\nMore information about charging EVs can be found on Electric vehicles and charging.\nLearn more about Electric vehicle charging points.\nThere are over 100 chargepoints across the Island. View the Live charge-point map.\nThe outright cost of an EV is higher than a conventional car. However, you can save money on running costs with an EV.\nAccording to the Review into Fuel Prices in Jersey 2022, the average driver in Jersey spends between £960 to £1,440 on fuel each year, which means that EV drivers can save between £480 to £720 in fuel costs.\nFind out how much money you could save by switching to an EV with the JEC fuel cost calculator.\nEVs have fewer moving parts that need to be serviced, reducing repair and maintenance costs by as much as 50%. Industry research indicates that the average cost to repair and service a traditional vehicle is £273 per year. EV drivers save over £135 per year on maintenance costs in addition to the longer lifespan of their vehicle.\nWith the right care and maintenance, EVs can drive 200,000 miles before it is time to retire them.\nOn average, EVs have a range of around 200 miles. In Jersey, the range of an EV should not be an issue due to the size of our Island.\nThere may be concerns about the range of your EV when travelling to the UK or France. However, the UK has an extensive rapid charging network where an EV driver is never more than 25 miles from a chargepoint on a motorway or A-road, and France has over 30,000 units available for EV drivers.\nView the UK’s Live charge-point map.\nView France’s Live charge-point map.\nPetrol and diesal vehicles have mechanical valves, gears and fans that create noise. This makes it easier for pedestrians to hear ICE vehicles. Electric and hybrid vehicles are much quieter as their wheels and air resistance at speed are their main sources of noise.\nThis is a safety concern for pedestrians, especially those with sight and hearing impairments. To improve safety, all electric and hybrid vehicles must have a noise system installed that complies with the Quiet Road Transport Vehicles (QRTV) law. This alert system must sound when the vehicle is reversing or travelling at less than 18 miles per hour.", "scores": {"score": 4, "score_transform_1": 5, "score_transform_2": 5, "score_transform_3": 0}}
{"id": "3958", "text": "Date: 20 October 2018\nA scoreless draw in this local derby would probably have been the prediction of many neutrals – but not, I’d imagine, of the supporters on either side. Fortunately it doesn’t tell the whole story, because there were parts of this game (notably just after the break and just before the very end) that were played at a fast and furious pace; and there were heart-stopping moments at both ends of the pitch.\nThis game sold out faster than any other Cherries’ league or cup game this season to date. For the first time, I was unable to get a seat in the East Stand (even though there were no ‘blocked’ seats between the home and away fans today) and I had to pay extra to go into the Main Stand. I was surprised to find that at a time (2:15) when the queues for the East Stand were massive as always – fans taking at least a quarter of an hour to get into the ground – the same number of people were entering the Main Stand without having to queue at all. No-one wanted to check my bag – or search my pockets – and I could only conclude that the Club presume that the higher priced tickets guarantee a more trustworthy kind of punter! There were actually a few empty seats near me, for some reason or other, and it was disconcerting to see the team playing the ‘wrong’ way in the first half (i.e. left to right), even though I was aware that strictly speaking they were ‘right’ and I was ‘wrong’!\nThe day was unseasonably warm, far exceeding the forecasts, and the sun was shining brightly at 2 – but that didn’t stop the Club from putting the floodlights on. It seems that although we can’t afford a new stadium or new training facilities there’s still some money to waste. We’d all been given free clappers again – and a free sticker album. Speaking of money, the cheaply purchased David Brooks was still keeping the £15 million Jordon Ibe out of the team, and rightly so given that he’d scored in successive matches. And he began brightly too, almost creating a scoring opportunity for the home side in the first few minutes, but he then seemed to go off the boil and on the hour mark was replaced by Stanislas (Fraser moving to the right wing to accommodate this change). In fact the entire line-up, including the bench, was identical to the 4-0 win at Watford. But no-one played quite as well as they had then. Even Lerma and Ake, though they were still more impressive than most of their colleagues, both made a few mistakes today. Indeed Ake’s failure to beat Charlie Austin on 35 minutes resulted in the best scoring opportunity of the first half falling to the visitors – though fortunately for us Austin then ran out of space to shoot. As a 0-0 draw continued to be played out on the pitch, it fell to the fans to make their own entertainment. The North Stand inevitably sang ‘Mind the gap’ and ‘The south coast is ours’. Away fans predictably responded with ‘When the saints go marching in’ and we equally predictably answered that with ‘You’ve only got one song’.\nThe half time ‘entertainment’ comprised on-pitch interviews with ‘legends’ Neil Young and Ted MacDougall. The latter probably upset a few fans when he said that among the happiest years of his career were the two he spent at Southampton! He was then asked, if he could be twinned with any other Bournemouth striker past or present, who would he most like to play alongside? I thought he’d stick with Boyer but he actually didn’t hesitate before replying ‘Jermain Defoe’. And yes, one can imagine that that would indeed have been a lethal combination.\nOur best spell was probably in the opening minutes of the second half, but Southampton soon upped their game to match ours. The best scoring chance of this half fell to us when on 65 minutes a well-worked move involving Stanislas and Wilson gave King a golden opportunity to score – but unfortunately his shot from close range went wide. A few minutes later, a Fraser corner met Ake’s head, and his header was a powerful one, but it was an easy one for the keeper to catch. Stanislas and Fraser were now giving everything they had on the wings, but Fraser’s move to the right turned out to be short-lived as Ibe replaced him on 76 minutes. Before this, Ings had been substituted for Southampton and seemed genuinely surprised at the warmth of the ovation he received from all four sides of the stadium, so he paused during his exit from the pitch and returned the compliment. Well, he is still one of a very small group from the Bournemouth Academy to have played in the Premier League.\nSitting where I was, I was able to see how animated Eddie Howe was becoming towards the end of the game – shouting endless instructions to his players. It wasn’t that he was displeased with their performance; he was just as nervous as we all were about holding on to the clean sheet. This is probably why, with five minutes of normal time to go, he replaced King with Gosling in preference to Defoe (despite Defoe’s attempts to gain Eddie’s attention by warming up frantically). So Gosling played in the ‘hole’ behind Wilson, as he had done towards the end of each of the previous two league games. As five minutes of extra time were announced, we actually looked the more likely team to score, but we weren’t taking too many chances. After all, 0-0 was good enough to keep us in sixth place in the Premier League.\nThe team lined up as follows at the start of the game (I've given the players marks out of ten):\nFrancis (7), S Cook (6), Ake (7), Smith (6);\nBrooks (5), L Cook (6), Lerma (7), Fraser (6);\nWilson (6), King (6)", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

{"id": "4038", "text": "The London Aircraft Production Group\nBy Brian A L Jones\nWhen looking at Britain’s industrial output during WWII one can only marvel at what was achieved in a non-digital age. The management, coordination and logistics required to bring sophisticated programmes to timely completion, I believe, would be difficult to emulate in today’s computerised world.\nThe subject of that observation is London Aircraft Production Group (LAP) which was led and coordinated by the London Passenger Transport Board (LT) between 1940 and 1945 to produce Handley Page Halifax heavy bomber aircraft.\nThe other members of the Group were: Chrysler Motors Ltd., Duple, Express Motor and Body Works and Park Royal Coachworks\nAs can be seen on the following sketch map, it is notable that all of the selected companies were situated on or close to main roads in the North and North West areas of London, with the exception of Chrysler whose factory was just south of the River Thames at Kew. This was no doubt an important consideration as all the components, some sizable, would need to be moved by road to Leavesden Aerodrome for assembly. Until the latter part of the War, when V-1 and V-2 weapons became a menace, those areas were less liable to enemy attack, than East and South London.\nUnder the Chairmanship of (LT’s) Lord Ashfield (1), LAP would eventually provide an organisation capable of completing one aircraft per hour, delivering 710 Halifaxes before construction terminated in April 1945, out of a total of 6,176 built overall. Beyond the companies in LAP, there were 600 sub-contractors and, in total, 51,000 employees (more than 50% female) were engaged in the construction processes.\nThe Halifax was initially designed and built by Handley Page and the prototype made its first flight from RAF Bicester on 25 October 1939, with the first operational aircraft handed over to 35 Squadron at RAF Leeming on 23 November 1940. Although it had been preceded into squadron service by the Short Stirling, which was the RAF’s first four engine heavy bomber, the Halifax was the first to bomb Germany, on 12-13 March 1941 when Hamburg was raided. Production was ramped up quickly, with, in addition to LAP, English Electric at Preston, Fairey at Stockport and Rootes at Speke all mass producing the Halifax.\nI have selected a range of photographs from the large number available to try and illustrate each company’s contribution to the scheme. While most photos are obviously carefully posed, they illustrate some interesting working practices that would almost certainly raise health and safety issues today!\nThe views also confirm the major participation of female workers and that most workshops were artificially illuminated at all times, due to the need to maintain blackout conditions.\nWhile London Transport had no previous experience of aircraft construction, they were able to provide strong engineering leadership. LT were able to utilise a new factory like building that had been constructed to stable and maintain tube trains for the planned Northern Line extension from Edgware which had been deferred with the outbreak of war. Located at Aldenham(2), near Elstree, it had the added advantage of being alongside the Watford by-pass directly connecting it to Leavesden airfield a short distance away where final assembly of the Halifaxes was to be undertaken.(3)\nDetail parts were also produced by LT at their Chiswick Works and White City.\nChiswick, which was largely given over to army tank design and production under the direction of LT’s Chief Mechanical Engineer A A M “Bill” Durrant, contributed details parts for the assembly of centre sections and front fuselages for Halifaxes at the Aldenham Works.\nLT used buildings at White City for the construction of Halifax engine cowlings and storage of components and spare parts. Other component parts were assembled in the subway that joined Earl’s Court Station to the Exhibition Hall on the other side of the road.\nDuple produced 750 front fuselage sections (including all of those fitted to the LAP’s 710 Halifaxes) in their works at Edgware Road, Hendon.\nExpress Motor and Body Works was located at the junction of the great Cambridge Road and Southbury Road in Enfield (4). Their modern premises had only been opened in October 1938 and provided 110,000 of floor space and, significantly, included a state of the art wood working complex. Their specialist peace time activity was the construction of cab units for commercial vehicles.\nThe company was selected to produce tailplanes and intermediate wing sections for the Group.\nPark Royal Coachworks, Abbey Road, Park Royal was selected to produce outer wings and engine cowlings. The company also produced around 16,000 military vehicles and utility buses during the wartime period.\n1. Born Albert Henry Knattkies in New Normanton, Derbyshire. He subsequently emigrated to the United States, where his father worked for the Pullman Company and changed their family surname to Stanley. Albert made his name when involved in tramway developments in Detroit and New Jersey. On returning to the UK, he joined Underground Electric Railways of London, becoming their Chairman in 1919. Before that he had been elected and served as an MP for Ashton-Under-Lyne 1916-1920 plus President of the Board of Trade 1916-1919. His Underground Chairmanship led to him being appointed as Chairman of the London Passenger Transport Board in 1933, a post he held until 1947. He was\nappointed to the British Transport Commission in 1948, but died late that year. He was awarded the title of first Baron Ashfield (the Nottinghamshire village where his father was born).\n2. Post WWII, as the creation of the Green Belt around London prevented housing development that would have justified continuing with the Northern Line extension, London Transport initially, in 1945 used the buildings to carry out bus maintenance and intake new vehicles. In 1956 the substantially rebuilt building was transformed into the main body overhaul works for its bus fleet and that use continued until the 1990s. The buildings were eventually demolished and the site cleared during June / July 1996. Slough Estates have subsequently developed the Centennial Business Park there.\n3. It may be worthwhile noting that, in the immediate post war period, Elstree Aerodrome, which lies adjacent to the Aldenham site, provided maintenance facilities for the civil Halifax operations of London Aero Motor Services, one of the numerous companies that sought to provide freight services as demand grew for the import and export of goods.\n4. Post WWII the aerodrome was used by de Havilland for aircraft maintenance and aircraft engine manufacturing, the latter passing to Rolls Royce. Flying ceased in March 1994 and the aerodrome buildings were adopted for film production – the Bond film Golden Eye was produced there in 1995 and all of the Harry Potter films have largely been made in the studios. Subsequently Warner Brothers introduced the Warner Bros. Studio Tour attraction in 2012. Part of the aerodrome site has also been adopted for housing development.\n5. The area formerly occupied by the factory is now given over to a B & Q Store, a Morrisons Supermarket and a Cineworld complex.\n6. The operational life of PN460 was disappointingly short. Delivered to 517 Squadron at Chivenor, Devon, which undertook meteorological flights until it was disbanded on 21 June 1946. The Halifax was struck off charge on 1 November 1946.\nExploring 20th Century London website\nRoyal Air Force – Owen Thetford – Putnam (1988 edition)\nA presentation loose-leaf album of photographs, believed to have been produced in 1945 by LT.

{"id": "4064", "text": "Window Cleaners Tarleton Lancashire (PR4): Having gleaming clean windows is just one of the ways that you can swiftly improve the look of your property in Tarleton. They doesn't just give your dwelling a welcoming feel, and an appealing new appearance, but clear windows also enable more natural daylight to enter your premises. One of those jobs that we all love to hate, cleaning your own windows can be a real hassle for most householders in Tarleton. As it often involves working from ladders, this work can be hazardous as well, which is why professional window cleaning services are much in demand in Tarleton.\nLeaving you free to do other things, bringing in the help of an expert also means that you won't need to find or purchase the necessary tools and equipment (bucket, cloths, ladder, squeegee and scrapers), saves you from risking life and limb by hanging out of windows or clambering up a ladder and lessens the likelihood of you possibly damaging your windows by using incorrect cleaning materials or smashing them with the leg of your ladder.\nYou'll also notice that a proficientin Tarleton, will get your windows sparkling clean quicker and more efficiently than you could ever hope to do yourself, consequently it's really a no brainer.\nFinding a window cleaner in Tarleton that you can trust isn't always going to be all that straightforward, and many window cleaners don't do much advertising except maybe for an odd leaflet posted through your door or a postcard in a local corner window. However if you're at home a lot, you will occasionally observe one strolling along your street with a bucket and ladder, so you think about approaching him or her and ask them to clean your windows and then put you on their cleaning round. Of course, you have no way of finding out whether this individual is \"unsavoury\" or legitimate, so when you're employing this method you need to be vigilant. A different approach is to check out some web basedfor example Rated People or Bark.com and get them to do your search for you, that may take a bit of the risk away as you are able to check out customer reviews for these in Tarleton, Lancashire.\nWhy Do I Need a Window Cleaner? - Whether you like it or not, sooner or later the windows of your house in Tarleton will have to be cleaned. Instead of running about with a bucket and squeegee, why not give some thought to calling inwho'll get them cleaned in less time, and a lot more safely, than if you chose to do it yourself. It could be that you have a hectic schedule and can't spare the time required for cleaning, or it may perhaps be that you don't like heights and clambering up a ladder with a bucket in your hand isn't really what you choose to be doing with your day. The most effective solution is right before you - just get on the phone to your amiable local window cleaner and he or she will get that messy task out of the way in the blink of an eye, leaving all of your windows clean and dirt-free, thus saving you the aggravation.\nAny decent Tarleton window cleaner will also be using better tools and equipment, which are a lot more effective than the frayed cloth and bucket of warm water that your regular Tarleton homeowner would be using to clean their windows. Kitted out with elaborate, multi-adjustable ladders that can reach all of those awkward to reach places, hose-fed extendable poles for the completely unreachable window panes, and specialist chemicals and cleaning agents which leave a thin, clear layer to protect your glass, the window cleaner will set about his work. Such materials are usually too costly for many homeowners who'll only use them occasionally and thus it may be cheaper in the long term to call in ato make sure your windows are properly cleaned and in great condition.\nInsurance Cover - To give themselves protection should an accident occur, and in addition to cover you in the event that they cause injury to you or your loved ones or damage your property whilst they are working on the windows of your property, all Tarleton window cleaners must have the appropriate public liability insurance. Being sure that any window cleaner or tradesperson who comes onto your property has the correct insurance protection is usually a wise idea. Any responsible Tarleton window cleaner will be quite willing to show you the relevant documentation.\nWindow cleaners in Tarleton normally focus on a certain area each day, consequently you ought to try and get yourself added to an existing cleaning round where feasible. Ask nearby neighbours and acquaintances by who, and when, they get windows cleaned. If the window cleaner can slot you in alongside a few other homes, and doesn't have to travel out of his/her way specifically to deal with your windows, the chances are it will work out cheaper for you. Top notch Tarleton window cleaners pride themselves in developing a solid reputation and making certain that their clients are happy.\nOffice & Commercial Window Cleaning Tarleton\nNeedless to say it's not just homes that need to have their windows washed regularly - commercial buildings and offices also need this service. While quite a few Tarleton window cleaners concentrate mostly on residential buildings, others specialise in the commercial aspect of the business. Specialist equipment might be necessary to clean the windows of certain industrial and office buildings, and this kind of stuff isn't necessarily owned by every window cleaner in Tarleton. Even so, lots of industrial and office properties don't call for any specialised tools or equipment, and can get their windows cleaned in much the same way as houses do. Buildings such as cafes, salons, business units, low-rise office blocks, factories or retail outlets, would come within this classification. But, when faced with multi-storey buildings and office blocks, ropes, hoists, abseiling, davits, cradles or platforms could be required.\nHigh-Rise Window Cleaning Tarleton\nThere are many benefits to owning office space in a high-rise, and being able to enjoy fantastic views is one of the most important. Needless to say, those windows will have to be routinely cleaned if you are to get the most from those breathtaking views. High-rise office window cleaning poses something of a challenge, which without doubt makes this among the most hazardous jobs on the planet. This isn't a job that anyone in Tarleton can undertake, and it calls for somebody who's thoroughly trained and has no fear of heights.\nThe proprietors of high-rise buildings generally hire specialist window cleaning services in Tarleton for dangerous work like this. The prices for high-rise window cleaning in Tarleton can be rather high, but that is quite understandable when you take into account the risks being taken. Attempting to get the windows clean from inside is pointless when the outside remains filthy.\nSome of the locally available window cleaning solutions in Tarleton are less pricey than others, and you should undertake some research to find the ones that match your allocated budget. It's vital that you choose a high-rise window cleaning contractor that is experienced in this sector and uses the proper equipment and cleaning products. You need to be certain that everyone who is working on your office building is sticking to health and safety guidelines and is properly covered with insurance.\nSkylight cleaning plays a vital role in preserving the beauty and functionality of skylights. Over time, debris, dirt and dust have a tendency to accumulate on skylights, hindering the entry of natural daylight into your home. Safely removing streaks, dirt and grime from skylights' interior and exterior surfaces is made possible by professional window cleaners and their specialised tools and methods. Ample sunlight can illuminate your working or living areas as skylights regain their transparency through extensive cleaning. By ensuring maximum light penetration, regular skylight cleaning enhances the aesthetic appearance of your space, thereby promoting a welcoming and bright environment.

The design of the new product was absolutely faceless – no zest. Undoubtedly, quality components from the best suppliers were used for the assembly. But the modern car market is literally full of “good cars”.\nThe skeptics’ opinions could not shake the belief in victory. The management in Stuttgart decided to develop Borgward Group AC further. Moreover, it was able to convince the Chinese BAIC of its success. The cargo department of Foton Motor bought 67% of the shares of the German Borgvard and launched production in Miune.\nThe management of the car concern planned to build a factory in Bremen and to start assembling electric Borgvards. However, the project did not go ahead. Problems also arose with the development of the dealer network. As a result, the sales of Chinese parquet flooring was started by the guys from Sixt. In total, a negligible number of cars were sold – about 30 pieces.\nBy the way, the ATU contractor is also engaged in maintenance of the cars. In a word, it turned out unrealistically. In China, Borgward has several branded showrooms and official service. However, in the first 9 months of 2018, the company managed to sell just over 26,000 cars. While at the start of the project it was a question of plans to sell up to 500 thousand cars a year.\nWhy don’t they buy a Borgward?\nExperts named three main reasons why Borgward crossovers are not sold in Europe or China:\n- Not the most successful design. For example, the Chinese like original cars, which is not the case with the standard Borgward.\n- This is the overall decline of the car market. First of all, because of oversupply and “trade wars”.\n- And the third, most important reason Brand Borgward knows very little. Residents of the Celestial Soul do not tea in Western brands. But only if they are famous and premium. And when the car is “not by ear”, there is no great desire to buy it. If Chinese tourists, traveling in Europe, saw a lot of Borgward cars, they would be happy to buy a little-known brand. But to buy an unknown crossover, and even with a premium price tag… The client does not see a single strong argument in favor of such a purchase. And gives preference to BMW, Audi, Porsche. In a word, anything but Borgward.\nShares – go ahead, bye-bye\nSeeing how unfavorable the events unfolded, Foton Motor quickly got rid of the failed asset. UCAR Group decided to try their luck with the German brand. Bruno Lambert, who previously headed Magna Steyr in Asia, was appointed head of the group. The approximate amount of the deal is $580 million.\nThe appearance of Borgward in Russia is not yet expected. Despite the fact that at the beginning of 2018 Foton announced the certification of the BX7 model in Russia, after the dumping of illiquid assets, export prospects leave much to be desired.", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

{"id": "4126", "text": "The California Department of Health Service and the Massachusetts Public Health Biologic Laboratories jointly developed Baby BIG (Botulism Immune Globlulin) antitoxin to treat infants infected with infant botulism. In adults and older children, botulism infection is the result of ingesting food containing botulinum toxin produced by botulism bacteria growing in food. Infant botulism on the other hand, occurs when babies ingest bacterial spores and the bacteria colonize their large intestines. The disease is rare enough to have qualified for “orphan disease” status in 1989, which helped provide funding for the development of Baby BIG.\nWhile botulism antitoxin has been produced commercially in the United States since 1940, using it to treat infants carried risks. Historically, antitoxin was derived from the blood serum of horses who had been injected with the botulinum toxin. Blood serum from these inoculated horses contained protective antibodies, which when injected into infected humans worked as an immune-response boosting antitoxin. (For more on equine botulism antitoxin see object 2001.0131.02 Vial, botulism anti-toxin.) Although generally successful in treating botulism, the horse-derived antitoxin serum sometimes induced allergic responses or serum sickness in patients, a complication that could be particular harmful for already ill infants.\nFor this reason, doctors preferred to use human-derived rather than horse-derived serum in the treatment of infants. Human-derived serum was first developed by the U.S. Army in the late 1970s and became available for public use in the early 1980s. With the start of the Gulf War, however, the military source of the antitoxin dried up as reserves were diverted to prepare for possible biological warfare attacks. In 1991 the California Department of Health Service and the Massachusetts Public Health Biologic Laboratories began work to develop their own human-derived botulism antitoxin. CDHS collected blood plasma from volunteers on its staff, who had already been inoculated against botulism for workplace safety. Their antibody-rich blood plasma formed the basis of the drug Baby BIG, which the FDA gave final approval for commercial sale for the treatment of infant botulism in 2003.\n“Human Botulism Immune Globulin for the Treatment of Infant Botulism.” Stephen S.

Histone lysine acylation is a major class of histone post-translational modifications involved in essential biological activities, such as transcriptional regulation, DNA-damage repair, and cell-cycle progression. Abnormal acylation is strongly associated with various diseases, such as cancer. Thus, histone acetyltransferases (HATs), the “writers” that catalyze histone acylation, are promising targets for cancer treatment. Rapid developments in structural biology and artificial intelligence have facilitated the development of drugs targeting HATs. To provide new ideas for exploring novel HAT modifiers with high efficiency and selectivity, this article reviews the relationships between acylation and diseases, illustrates HAT catalytic mechanisms through structural biology, and summarizes research progress in HAT modifiers.\nActa Materia Medica welcomes the submission of research articles, review articles, databases, mini reviews, commentaries, editorials, short communications, case report articles and study protocols.\nSubmissions to Acta Materia Medica are made using ScholarOne, the online submission and peer review system.

It supposedly began in 1982 when Anne Herbert scrawled the words “practice random acts of kindness and senseless acts of beauty” on a place mat. The rest, as they say, is history.\nNow there’s a new way to express kindness. Zachary Gibson started the Tiny Mailbox Project earlier this year. Gibson set a goal of 100 tiny mailboxes around Los Angeles earlier this year. But his idea has spread far beyond the city limits of LA.\nThe Tiny Mailbox Project provides the opportunity to be kind, one person at a time, without ever necessarily meeting the recipient of your kindness.\nThe concept is simple. Each mailbox contains an encouraging note along with several blank cards. The recipient takes the note, and leaves one for someone else.\nIn a recent interview, Gibson shared his belief that “trying to restore a little faith in humanity is a good thing.”\nI confess, I don’t have much faith in humanity any more. The Bible tells us no one is righteous (Romans 3:10). Even if I didn’t believe what the Bible says, all I have to do is observe humanity in action.\nYet, just when it appears kindness has died out, it shows itself once again–this time in the midst of disaster. Hurricane Harvey is the worst weather event to hit Houston in 50 years. Still, it provided the backdrop for a massive, ongoing act of kindness on the part of furniture store owner, Jim McIngvale.\nMcIngvale has opened up his 2 showrooms for evacuees, without regard for his immediate profits. His daily losses are estimated at a minimum of $30,000 per day.\nSo what can professing Christians learn from Zachary Gibson and Jim McIngvale?\nWe know the Bible tells us kindness is a “fruit of the Spirit” (Galatians 5:22). This means that the more we surrender to the leading of God’s Spirit in our lives, the more kindness will mark our relationships.\nYet kindness has not marked our conversations and behavior very much in the area of politics or morality. Christians are known more for what we are against than what we are for. Many of us have lost the ability to stand firm for biblical values without trying to destroy those who disagree with us at the same time.\nAnd along comes tiny mailboxes and a furniture store owner to remind us what kindness could look like if we stopped being belligerently self-righteous.\nWhat would happen if Christians spoke the truth…in love (Ephesians 4:15)?\nOr if we were so surrendered to the Holy Spirit that our “fruit” attracted those who are hungry for food that feeds the soul?\nWhat would happen if being kind wasn’t just something we practiced with other Christians, but something we practiced regardless of the recipient?\nPerhaps it’s time to find out. What do you think?", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

{"id": "4199", "text": "Oranjestad, St. Eustatius – Juvenile criminal law is applicable in the Caribbean Netherlands as of August 1st, 2020. The pedagogical approach is characteristic of juvenile criminal law. This means that punishments and measures for young people aged 12 to 18 are aimed at having a positive impact on behaviour, re-education and preventing recidivism.\nWith the introduction of juvenile criminal law, there will be more options in the juvenile criminal law chain to deal with criminal behaviour. Important elements in this process include the reintroduction of the Halt programme, the introduction of juvenile detention, the coordination of community service orders and the supervision of special conditions by the Probation Office.\nAvoid a criminal record\nIn the case of petty crimes like vandalism, skipping school or driving without a driving licence, the police may refer young people to Halt. There juveniles are given the opportunity to rectify their criminal behaviour. Halt aims to stop transgressive behaviour among juveniles as early as possible by means of interviews, work and educational assignments, and apologising to the victim. If the Halt programme is completed successfully, the juvenile will not receive a criminal record.\nIn the case of more serious offences like abuse or an act of violence, the Public Prosecution Service may decide to prosecute a juvenile. The Guardianship Council will then investigate the juvenile’s past history and subsequently advises the Public Prosecution Service’s Public Prosecutor on what punishment would be most suitable for the young person. The Court ultimately decides what punishment will be imposed.\nThe Court may impose a fine or juvenile detention on the young person. The latter is a prison sentence specifically intended for juveniles who have committed a serious offence. The Court may also impose this punishment as a suspended sentence. This will be done under special conditions. If a juvenile reoffends or does not comply with the conditions, the Court may decide that the juvenile must be placed in juvenile detention after all. In detention, different rules apply to the youth section. For instance, minors may not be placed in solitary confinement and neither may they be placed together with adults. Additionally, there are guidelines for juveniles regarding daytime activities, education and receiving visitors.\nSpecial conditions which can be imposed on juveniles are for instance a community service order, compulsory treatment or a curfew. The Probation Office coordinates community service orders and monitors a juvenile’s observance of special conditions. Often a juvenile is also assigned a Youth Care (in Dutch: Jeugdzorg) probation counsellor. The objective is to keep the juvenile on the right path and to ensure that they do not reoffend.

Doubt is destabilizing and we do whatever we can to avoid it. This is all the more true when it comes to matters of faith. Doubt and faith rule each other out. It is one or the other. And if you are in a state of doubt, your job is to get rid of it.\nDoubt is an assault on faith. We know this because doubts lead to such destructive emotions as fear, depression, anger, irritability, and stress.\nClearly, God does not want us to doubt. Right?\nThere is a benefit of doubt. Doubt is a gift of God to move us from trusting ourselves to trusting him.\nDoubt forces us to examine what we believe about God—and this can be unsettling. What we thought was our “faith in God” sometimes winds up being little more than faith in ourselves—our own ability to grasp God, to possess him our way, to have him figured out.\nDoubt is God’s way of tearing down the private fantasy we have constructed about him—where what we think about God is without further need of reflection, no longer open to growth. Doubt does not mean that God is “dying” for us. Doubt signals that we are beginning to die to ourselves, and that can be very painful—dying usually is.\nIn the words of some theologians, doubt helps tear down the idols we have constructed in making God into our own image. Or, to borrow a term from psychology, doubt helps us see the bankruptcy of our false self, which is that self we have made up to cope with the confusion of life, to put all things—even God—“in order.” Doubt backs us into a corner and forces us to look beyond the dysfunction of our false selves, of the “idols of our heart,” toward a greater intimacy with God where he is in control, not we.\nDo not resist doubt but patiently and honestly pass through it. Welcome it as a gift. Ask God what he might be teaching you about him, and about yourself.\nYou are not alone. Read the Psalms of lament where doubt is a plaguing reality. Read Ecclesiastes where Qoheleth’s entire universe of meaning is crumbling before him and he shakes his fist at God himself. Read about Job, whose personal narrative is being erased and rewritten before his eyes.\nThese three biblical examples are not there to warn us but instead to model for us what this process of destabilization and disorientation can look like. Core-shaking doubt is a normal part of the spiritual life. Passing through these times—not around them—leads to greater spiritual depth and intimacy with God.\nThe 16th century mystic theologian John of the Cross spoke famously of the “dark night of the soul.” This dark night is the sense of painful alienation and distance from God that causes much distress, anxiety, and depression in the believer. Sooner or later all Christians experience this state, and when they do some feel like giving up. Since God feels so far away, since they have lost their sense of belonging to God in that old familiar way, they conclude that they no longer have faith. And so they despair even more.\nBut like a church bell on a clear winter night, it is in the crisp darkness of doubt that God’s voice carries farther and more clearly. St. John’s great insight is that this dark night is a special sign of God’s presence, where our false sense of comfort is being stripped away and we are left naked before God and asked simply to trust. Then we begin to see that “alienation from God” was nothing of the sort. The dark night is God telling to us to let go of the small version of God we have been carrying around and to prepare for something deeper.\nRachel Held Evans says it well: “In the end, it was doubt that saved my faith.”1 She reminds us that the Christian life is a journey: we must learn to “live in the questions.” We will then learn to expect from God not the promise of ready answers, but the promise to move us out of our carefully crafted zones of comfort to a better place.\nFor some, thinking through the issues of evolution and Christianity trigger feelings of doubt. For others the issues are very different. But the point is the same. Something enters your life that you did not expect, and do not particularly welcome. You are so racked with doubt that you do not know how you can take another step, or why you should even bother at all. That is not the end of faith. That is when the journey can begin in earnest.\nBeing a Christian does not mean being certain of everything all the time. Doubt is a normal and important part of the Christian life. When God seems most absent, it may be then that he is speaking to you most clearly. It is then that you realize that your faith is not a fortress but a journey, and God means to take you “further up and further in.”\nAbout the author\nIf you enjoyed this article, we recommend you check out the following resources:\nAndrew Davison | Cosmic Incarnation", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

She wore a subdued ensemble for the comeback performance, opting for a black button-up T-shirt, matching denim, and hair pulled back in a neat ponytail.\nTracy has expressed her support for Luke's cover of her song.

After a long, yet adventurous trip, I finally landed in Gaborone. I arrived at Simba’s place, where I would call home for the next 4 months. After settling in and unpacking everything, I was greeted by Simba’s sister, Vimbai, and she gave me a quick tour of the city.\nI was now ready to begin my work at the Botswana National Olympic Committee (BNOC).

From here, I was introduced to the specific role that Ashley and I will be filling throughout the duration of my internship. I will be working closely with the Botswana Table Tennis Association (BTTA), implementing the first stage of the Botswana Long Term Athlete Development Model. This model was outlined by the previous SportWORKS Officer/QE Scholar and will help us implement the FUNdamental stage of table tennis to youths and local primary school physical education programs. So far, we have developed a work plan for our time being here and an outline of a program plan that we feel could help with the process of the FUNdamental stage. Now that this is done, we plan to schedule a meeting with the BTTA to review our work and to begin the physical implementation of these programs.\nThe BNOC was in the middle of preparing an event, the Olympic Day Celebration, when we arrived. I got to sit in on their event management meetings and watch them go through the process of planning their event and the steps they take to make these events possible. Ashley and I had the opportunity to partake in this event which targets local schools to participate in physical activities at their National Stadium, such as soccer, 100m dash, relay and doughnut races. The purpose of this event was to promote healthy and active living for the local youth children in Botswana. This started off with a 10 Km walk / run followed by Zumba and stretches before taking part in the activities listed above. Overall, the event was a great success and all who participated seemed to enjoy themselves. Another event we attended was the Youth Olympic Game athlete send off. We were able to watch athletes representing Botswana hold up their flag as they prepare to compete in Argentina.\nAside from work, I have been getting used to the city and what is around. I have had the opportunity to go on a few drives through the city to get a sense of what is nearby and things to do. I have had the opportunity to spend time with our roommate, Blessing. He has taken us to some local hangout spots for us to meet some of his close friends. At a graduation party we attended, I had the opportunity to try some of the local food dishes that we do not have at home.

We have been told that at least 600 people have been invited and that this style of wedding is a very big event that people from all over gather to attend.

{"id": "4414", "text": "Managed IT Benefits Business Owners\nBusiness owners have a lot on their plate. Even the smallest businesses have a lot of moving parts that need to be attended to, which all add up to a mammoth amount of stress for their owners. Perhaps most obviously, financial matters contribute greatly to this angst.\nEvery business has a considerable amount of money flowing in and out at any given time, which means that the owner has a considerable amount to keep track of. Simultaneously, there is the need to make sure that any money that is owed to the business is coming in, while the money that the business owes to its employees and uses to pay its bills must be tracked as well. After all, it would be hard to run a business without electricity, which is exactly the situation a business would find itself in if the power bill wasn’t paid.\nIn addition to financial concerns, there’s managing the human side of the business itself. Business owners have to balance so they can be both a resource and a disciplinarian for their staff members. In order for a business’ staff to be effective and productive, it helps if they are satisfied with the circumstances of their employment. Good employees will seek professional growth, growth that a business owner will want to do everything to encourage for the benefit of the company. Problematic and lax employees need to be addressed by management, ensuring that they aren’t slacking and wasting valuable company time. Oftentimes, if these employees create a human resources issue, it travels up the chain to the owner.\nA business’ clients are also an important consideration. After all, the purpose of the business is to provide a good or service to these clients, so it is essential that these clients are treated well and professionally. A business owner needs to make sure that all processes are being followed as their team interacts with their clients, delivering what has been promised and following up promptly.\nThis is all without mentioning the technology that supports a business, and all the processes that need to be completed to keep this technology up and running. Any software patches need to be applied, all security solutions need to be kept updated, and the company backup needs to be tested.\nFinally, there’s all the responsibilities that a business owner has that don’t actually pertain to the business. Family matters and personal concerns also come into play in anyone’s life--and of course, all these concerns aren’t organized so nicely in real life. It is almost as if these concerns were all thrown into a blender and pulsed, making business and personal life that much more difficult to manage.\nDigital Sky Solutions can help a little by taking over some of these responsibilities. By managing your information technology, our services allow you the confidence that your IT will be ready for your business to use--and that you have a trusted resource to lean on if things go wrong.

The 191st Manchester derby was all City as the gulf between the two sides was obvious at Old Trafford.\nA brace from Erling Haaland and a late Phil Foden goal was enough for the treble winners to seal all three points. It could’ve been more for the European champions if not for a determined Andre Onana performance in goal for United.\nFor the European champions, every player did their part. Bernardo Silva was at his best as he and Jack Grealish ran United ragged on City’s left-hand side. They were a constant threat throughout and it was no surprise when they combined to set Erling Haaland up for his second of the game. The beautiful team goal ended the game as a contest and from there City dominated.\nThere was time for Phil Foden to add a third after being set up by Erling Haaland. Rodri had a viscous shot saved by Onana and Haaland reacted quickest to provide Foden with a tap-in. Haaland’s performance was a reminder to the football world of his case for the Ballon d’Or. The award is announced this week and City’s number 9 is one of the favourites for the prestigious award.\nAll over the pitch, Manchester City were the better side, and the gap between the two sides appeared to widen.

{"id": "4499", "text": "You sent a text message, and it says “delivered”. Then a few moments later it changes to “read”, at which point you wait, expecting a response. None arrives though, and you’re left wondering why? Maybe you said the wrong thing and made the other person uncomfortable, made them mad, or perhaps they just don’t think a response is warranted.\nUntil that text gets answered, you’ll likely be feeling letdown and anxious about what’s going on. It sucks if what you texted was important, needed a response, or could compromise you in some way. It’s even worse though if you text someone you’re dating and don’t get a reply.\nYou’ve been left on “read”, and now you’re worried, running through a million scenarios in your head as to what’s wrong. Are they just busy, or did you say something bad? Maybe they don’t care the same way you do, and you should move on. This kind of second-guessing happens when we get left on read, and it’s not a nice feeling at all.\nWhat we want most of all is a response to our text, but we’d also like to know why they didn’t respond and hear their excuses for leaving someone on read.\nOn the flip side, if you’re the person who for one reason or another has left someone on read, you really should get back to them asap. It’s not vital to reply immediately, because you could have your hands full, but you should realize that they’re probably waiting for a response and depending on the situation, could be suffering from mental anguish until you reply.\nIf for whatever reason you’ve failed to respond in a timely manner, then you’ll need some believable excuses for not replying. That is of course only if you care for or respect the person whose text you ignored. To help you out, we’ve put together this curated list of the best excuses for leaving someone on read – hope it helps!\nThe best general excuses for leaving someone on read\nOut of all the excuses for not getting back to someone, the ones in this category are the most interchangeable of the bunch. Blame the cell phone company, your concentration, or your clumsy fingers but these reasons can get you out of almost any hot seat without too much fuss.\n1. You must have missed the message\nIt’s happened before, where you were texting with someone and just before you closed the messaging app, another text came in. It happened so fast that you didn’t see it, but it was enough to trigger the read receipt on the other end. It’s a little tough to explain this one, but it could very well be true, and as long as you get back to them the next time you open your phone, it should be all good.\n2. You forgot to respond\nYeah, you saw the text, but you needed a minute to think about your reply. Then something came up and stole your attention. You meant to respond but you forgot – it was a hectic day.\n4. You failed to hit send\nThis happens quite a bit actually. You typed out your reply and then either forgot to hit send or mis-clicked the button. Either way, you thought you sent the message and were waiting on a response yourself. It’s a common mistake, but sorry for the confusion.\n5. You were at work and couldn’t reply\nIt was a busy day in the office or on the job site and you couldn’t reply until now. Let the person know the reason and apologize sorry for making them wait. Maybe make up some excuses to leave work early so you can reply to your missed messages.\n6. Your phone was on silent\nAt work, at the movies or just taking a nap. None of these were a good time for your phone to get blown up with calls or messages, so you put it on mute. You didn’t see the text and that’s why you didn’t reply.\n7. The text didn’t arrive\nYou’ve been having issues with your provider and the reception on your phone has been patchy. Several people have said they weren’t able to reach you today, but there’s nothing you could do about it. It’s a probable excuse for not replying to a text message.\n8. You fell asleep\nYou had a long day and were just watching some TV on the couch when you fell asleep. Either that or you nodded off while thinking of a response, which is why you didn’t get back and left them on read.\n9. Your GF or BF deleted the message\nYes, you’re in the type of relationship where you have access to each others’ phones. This excuse would work best if you use it on one of your friends that doesn’t get along well with your significant other. That way it would make sense that they read your message about “let’s go drinking this weekend”, and promptly deleted it.\n10. You texted the wrong person back\nIf you were juggling text messages, it’s possible that you replied to the wrong person. You just found out about it now and you’re a bit embarrassed.\nTechnology-related excuses for not texting back\nThings like your cellphone, laptop, and tablet are amazing tools but they aren’t foolproof in their reliability. The batteries die, phones disappear, or they get damaged in an accident. Sometimes it’s better to blame the machine than yourself and throw your phone under the bus (not literally of course).\n1. Your phone died\nThis one is a classic and for good reason. Having your phone run out of battery is absolutely plausible, and if it happened, there’s no way you could have replied. You’ll have to be careful not to show yourself online somewhere else, like on WhatsApp or Messenger, and if the person you left on read calls you and it rings – your excuse is pooched.\n2. You lost cellphone reception\nYou were traveling through a rural area or surrounded by tall buildings in the downtown core, either of which could have caused you to lose reception. Without the network, there’s no way you would have been able to respond to any messages. This can be a good excuse for not messaging back right away.\n3. You misplaced your phone\nYou’re a scatterbrain, you admit it. Somehow you always end up misplacing something, be it your car keys, your wallet, or in this case your cellphone. You would respond but you needed to find your phone first.\n4. Your phone got stolen\nDamn your luck, this is the second phone this year that’s been jacked out of your gym locker. You can insert whatever story about how it happened, but your phone got stolen and you’ve been out of the loop ever since. This excuse for leaving someone on read should trigger sympathy instead of anger, but it might be tough to keep the story going if you show up with the same phone later on.\n15. You left your phone at home\nYou were in a rush to get out of the house this morning and you ended up leaving your phone behind by mistake. Not only have you been unable to reply to your messages, but you’ve also had a hell of a time doing pretty much anything – that’s how reliant you’ve become on your mobile device.\n6. You dropped your phone in a puddle\nCoffee in one hand, phone in the other, and then your clumsy fingers dropped the darn thing straight into a puddle. Your phone spent the last couple of days drying out in a jar of rice and that’s why you weren’t able to respond until now.\n7. Your text message plan is limited\nThe cell phone plan you’re currently signed up for only allows for a limited number of text messages every month. Unfortunately, you received the message but weren’t able to reply without being billed over-limit fees. Too bad your job doesn’t give you a work phone – maybe it’s time to come up with excuses for quitting a job you just started.\nYou were “busy” excuses for leaving someone on read\nLife can get hectic and sometimes text messages aren’t the biggest priority. If something was urgent that person surely would have called instead, right? There are lots of reasons you could have been too busy to respond, and here are our favorites.\n1. You were super busy\nAnother valid excuse for leaving someone on read, provided that you did text them back eventually, sis being super busy. You read the message but were in the middle of something so you couldn’t respond. It could have been a meeting at work or a conference call. Reasons like you were driving, running on a treadmill, or speaking to your mom can be good ones too. Regardless of what you say, you should apologize for not texting back right away, but you’re also allowed to be busy.\n2. You were driving\nHands and distraction-free driving isn’t only important, it’s the law. Bad timing that the person messaged you while you were on the road, otherwise your reply would have been quicker to arrive.\n3. You were at a doctor’s appointment\nMost doctor’s or dentist’s offices are a no-phone zone. We’ve all seen the “please refrain from using your phone” signs posted in the waiting room. So, because you’re not a jackass, you followed the rules and put your phone on airplane mode. You might have read the text but then you weren’t able to reply at the time, which is why you’re using this excuse for leaving someone on read.\n4. You were at the gym\nWorking out properly requires focus and concentration. If you’re constantly texting or browsing social media, then your phone is causing your workout to suffer. You either didn’t check your phone while on the treadmill, or you left it in the changing room locker. Regardless, you didn’t see the message and didn’t respond until later.\n5. You were filming a juicy Snap\nMaking videos to post on social media is one of your hobbies. You also find it really annoying when what you’re doing gets interrupted by messages or worse, phone calls. That’s why when you’re recording, you don’t answer anyone until you’re creative masterpiece is complete.\n6. You were in an exam\nIf there’s one place where a phone isn’t allowed, it’s during an exam. If you started answering messages in the exam hall, you might just get kicked out for cheating and fail your class. Better just to turn the phone on silent and get back to people later on.\n7. You were watching a movie\nIt’s movie night and that means DND time for your phone. Sorry if it was urgent, but you weren’t able to respond until the credits rolled.\n8. You were too drunk\nA six-pack of beer, some vodka shots and a couple Jello shooters got the better of you last night. You were on the verge of being blackout drunk, so while you did see the message, your inebriated brain couldn’t comprehend formulating a response. It’s a legit excuse for leaving someone on read.\n9. You were too hungover\nNow its’ the next day and you know you should be getting back to people, but you have a splitting headache and just looking at your phone makes you nauseous. You’ll respond after the Advil kicks in and you start feeling better.\n10. You got eyedrops from the doctor\nYou had an appointment with your optometrist today and they put some drops in your eyes. Now everything is blurry and bright light makes your peepers water. It’s not a great time for texting so you’ll have to get back to your friend later.\n11. You were eating\nGreasy fingers and texting don’t mix. Neither does talking with your mouth full, which is why this is a good excuse for not getting back to someone right away. After you ate, you had to do the dishes too, which should buy you a few more minutes on the response countdown clock.\n12. You had gloves or mittens on\nWinter is here and you like to wear gloves so your fingers stay warm. These also make it difficult to text, which is why you read the message but weren’t able to respond. We use this excuse for leaving someone on read almost exclusively during wintertime and it works like a charm.\nHonest excuses for leaving someone on read\nDepending on who you temporarily ghosted, an honest excuse might be the best option. That way you don’t have to lie, your excuse will really stick, and maybe you’ll come to terms on a few things so that your interactions are better moving forward.\n1. You assumed the statement was rhetorical\nWhatever the person sent you seemed like it didn’t require a reply. Misinterpretations happen all the time and you weren’t ignoring them, you just weren’t aware that they were awaiting a response.\n2. You needed a break\nIt should be understandable if you needed to take some time away from the hustle of life. These days our phones leave us constantly connected and reachable, which can be quite mentally taxing. That’s why you took a few hours or a couple of days off and didn’t get back to anyone for a while.\n3. You had other priorities\nIt’s as honest an excuse as you’re likely to find when it comes to dealing with conversations that you deem a waste of time. Maybe it’s not even that something is irrelevant to you, it’s just that you had a lot on your plate and some of it took precedence. It might seem harsh, but at least you’re being truthful and not blowing smoke up the persons @#$.\n4. You’re just bad at returning text messages\nIf you’re not into texting as much as others are then there’s a good chance you kinda suck at returning messages. In our opinion, that’s totally fair, and using this as an excuse for not texting someone back is great because it doesn’t leave much to argue about.\n5. You didn’t know how to respond\nThis happens a lot. Someone texts you something heavy or deep and it might take you some time to think about how you want to reply. It’s a polite gesture to send an “I’ll get back to you” message but sometimes that’s not appropriate either. Better just to take your time, send the reply you want, and then let them know why your answer took so long to arrive.\n6. You heard that texting could ruin a relationship\nIt’s true, too much texting can lead to a relationship going stale before it’s past due date. It’s often better to save interactions for a phone call or an in-person meeting so that you have something to talk about when it really matters. Constant texting can also become a drag, which will eventually make people resent having to spend the time. Of course, this doesn’t always apply, but you could use it as an excuse for leaving someone on read if you’re willing to be honest with them.\nCall instead of text if you forgot to message back\nIf you neglected to respond to a text from someone you care about, one of the best things you can do is call them back instead. Apologize for not responding but keep your excuse minimal (because you forgot or whatever), and then address the topic of the conversation you bailed on earlier. When you do that, it shows genuine interest in what’s going on, and that you feel bad about forgetting to reply. It’s a much better option than simply texting some random excuse back without being fully sincere.\nTell the truth about why you didn’t respond to a text\nSometimes you’d be better off just telling the truth. It’s almost more productive to skip inventing an excuse and say exactly why you didn’t respond. It’s also a more mature or honest way of dealing with the issue. If you forgot to respond, weren’t interested in the conversation, or the timing was bad, just say so. If the person has an issue with it, then that’s their problem.\nChances are that your excuse will sound like an excuse, and won’t have the desired effect anyway. If you’re not careful, lame excuses will drive someone away just the same as if you didn’t respond. Those that know you won’t be mad if you don’t reply, and those that don’t know you aren’t worth the hassle.", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

Incorporating meadow PNGs into your designs can enhance their visual appeal and help create a pleasant and inviting atmosphere.\nMeadow PNGs are the perfect way to add some greenery to your designs without having to worry about sourcing your stock images. With a wide variety of meadow PNGs available, you can choose the one that matches the theme and style of your art piece. Whether it's a bright and colorful meadow or a more subdued, muted one, there's a meadow PNG that can suit your needs.\nOne of the most significant advantages of meadow PNGs is that they offer transparency. This means that you can add them to your artwork without worrying about any unsightly white backgrounds or other distracting elements. This transparency makes meadow PNGs versatile, allowing them to be used in a variety of projects, from flyers and posters to digital illustrations and website designs.\nAnother benefit of using meadow PNGs is their high-resolution quality. Because they're typically large images, they provide a high level of detail that can give your artwork a professional touch. This detail is especially important if your artwork is being used for printing, where the resolution needs to be very high to prevent any unwanted pixelation.\nMeadow PNGs can also be used to create a specific mood or atmosphere in your design. For example, a meadow with bright flowers and lush greenery could be used to represent a joyful and energetic feeling, while a meadow with muted colors and a misty atmosphere can evoke a sense of mystery and tranquility.\nIn conclusion, meadow PNGs can be a valuable addition to your design toolkit. They offer transparency, high-resolution quality, and versatility, making them suitable for a wide range of projects.

{"id": "4556", "text": "Out of the Box Recruiting Strategies: The Future of Hiring\nRecruiting has always been an essential part of any organization. Hiring has traditionally involved posting job openings, screening resumes, conducting interviews, and selecting the best fit. However, recruiters realize these standard methods may only sometimes bring in the ideal candidate. As a result, there is a need for innovative recruitment techniques that go beyond the normal practices.\nThat’s where Out of the Box recruiting strategies come in. Out-of-Box Recruiting, or OTB Recruiting, refers to methods that deviate from conventional hiring methods. Instead, OTB strategies look at unique and innovative ways to find talent, like social media campaigns, talent scouting competitions, etc. Next, we will discuss out-of-the-box recruiting strategies and how they are shaping the future of hiring.\nIdentify and Understand Your Target Audience\nOne of the most critical steps in developing a successful recruitment strategy is identifying and understanding your target audience. Knowing who you are trying to attract to your company and why they would be a good fit is essential to creating compelling marketing messages.\nIt allows you to focus your resources on the areas that matter most, saving time and money.\nIt would be best to utilize out-of-the-box recruiting strategies to understand your target audience deeply. Try conducting surveys, focus groups, and even contacting industry experts for insights into what your ideal candidate may look for in their next job.\nEmployer branding is the process of creating and promoting the identity of an employer. It conveys an organization’s unique values, culture, and personality to potential and current employees. A company’s reputation as an employer can make or break the recruitment process. With a compelling employer brand, companies can stand out among their competitors and create a positive image in the minds of both job seekers and employees.\nDeveloping an employer brand requires a well-crafted strategy that aligns with the company’s values, mission, and goals. Companies can use various tools like social media, employee testimonials, and targeted messaging to build a compelling employer brand that attracts high-performing candidates.\nLeverage Social Media for Recruitment\nAs technology continues to evolve, social media is becoming increasingly important in the recruitment process. It’s no surprise that top talent is spending more time on social media than ever before. Companies must utilize this resource for recruitment to get the most qualified candidates.\nSocial media platforms allow recruiters to access a broader range of candidates faster than traditional recruitment methods. In addition, employers can engage with potential candidates through interactive content like videos, infographics, and images, making for a more personalized experience.\nJob Description: Beyond Traditional\nJob descriptions are more than just a set of responsibilities and requirements. They play a crucial role in the recruitment process and are the first impression that potential candidates have of a company. A practical job description should communicate the responsibilities and expectations of the position while also showcasing the company culture and values.\nTo make your job descriptions stand out, it’s essential to use clear and concise language that is engaging and informative. A well-crafted job description can attract top talent and ensure suitable candidates apply.\nGamification: Recruiting through Games\nGamification is a term used to refer to the process of applying game mechanics and elements to a non-game context. In the recruitment process, gamification is a tool that has been used in recent years to enhance the hiring process and attract the best talent available in the market. Rather than providing boring application forms, gamification has been introduced to make it more engaging and fun for potential candidates.\nBy using game mechanics such as leaderboards, badges, and challenges, gamification can increase engagement, improve the candidate experience, and ultimately lead to a more significant number of successful hires. Companies like Marriott International and Deloitte have already embraced this approach, proving its worth to the recruitment process.\nCreative Interviewing Techniques\nInterviews play a crucial role in recruitment, allowing employers to assess candidates’ suitability. However, there may be better ways to identify the right candidate than traditional interview techniques. It is where creative interviewing techniques emerge, allowing employers to uncover a candidate’s skills and experience uniquely and effectively.\nThese techniques can range from using role-play scenarios or asking thought-provoking questions to taking the candidate on a tour of the office to see how they engage with other employees. By being innovative, you can ensure you are selecting the best candidate for the job.\nCollaborate with Other Companies\nCollaborating with other companies can offer huge benefits when it comes to recruitment. Not only do you get to tap into a diverse pool of candidates, but you also benefit from other organizations’ relationships, experience, and industry insights. There are many ways to collaborate with other companies, whether through industry partnerships, job shadowing programs, or even shared talent pipelines.\nSome companies have had a lot of success with collaborative recruitment too. For example, Google partnered with the Department of Defense to develop the Defense Innovation Unit, which brings top tech talent into the government sector.\nEmployee Referral Programs\nThese programs offer numerous benefits and can be designed to suit your company’s needs. The most significant benefits of employee referral programs include decreased recruitment costs, faster hiring times, and higher employee retention rates. To design a successful employee referral program, you must establish clear guidelines, promote the program to your employees, and offer rewards that incentivize them to participate actively.\nDoing so can increase the chances of finding a perfect candidate for a job opening while also boosting employee morale and engagement. Some successful employee referral programs include those implemented by companies like Google, which offer substantial monetary rewards or even paid vacations for successful referrals.\nDiversity and Inclusion\nCompanies must implement strategies that promote diversity and inclusion in their recruitment processes. It can be achieved by providing staff training and education and creating initiatives that attract diverse candidates. Furthermore, best practices for promoting diversity and inclusion in recruitment include the following:\n- Removing any barriers that may prevent certain groups from applying for jobs.\n- Implementing unbiased hiring processes.\n- Ensuring that each candidate is evaluated solely on their qualifications and experience.\nAt the forefront of modern recruitment methods, video recruitment is a tool many organizations utilize to attract and hire top talent. This approach involves using videos to showcase a company’s culture, mission, and work environment, as well as highlight job responsibilities and responsibilities requirements. In addition, video recruitment allows HR departments to engage with candidates on a deeper level and create a more personalized experience.\nBy providing a more dynamic and informative company overview, video recruitment can help candidates make better-informed decisions about whether they want to apply for a given role. Companies that have implemented video recruitment find that it helps increase application rates and hire candidates that are a better fit for the company culture. Examples of effective video recruitment can be seen in companies such as LinkedIn and Dropbox.\nPersonalized recruitment is a strategy that prioritizes candidates’ unique needs and preferences. It involves tailoring communication and resources to individuals based on their interests, skills, and experience. Implementing personalized recruitment can significantly improve the candidate experience by creating a more engaged and personalized experience.\nStrategies for personalized recruitment include:\n- Using data to personalize outreach.\n- Creating individualized career paths.\n- Offering job training that aligns with an individual’s skills and interests.\nAll these methods can help candidates feel valued and acknowledged, increasing their interest in applying for and accepting job offers.\nEmployer advocacy is promoting a company as an employer to attract top talent. It can take many forms, including highlighting company culture, benefits, and perks or sharing success stories of current employees. Through employer advocacy, a company can build a reputation as a great workplace, making recruiting talented individuals easier. Examples of employer advocacy can include:\n- Hosting events for potential candidates.\n- Promoting company values on social media.\n- Striving for employee satisfaction through initiatives such as employee recognition and wellness programs.\nHackathons for Recruitment\nHackathons are intense collaborative events where teams of individuals come together to tackle a specific challenge, ranging from building a software application to creating a hardware device or designing a user interface. Companies have started using hackathons to identify and recruit top talent from among the participants. Hackathons provide a unique opportunity for companies to assess an individual’s skills in a real-world context, observe their problem-solving abilities and creativity, and evaluate their ability to work collaboratively within a team.\nSome successful examples of hackathons for recruitment include Facebook’s Hacktober, Google’s Code Jam, and LinkedIn’s Talent Connect Hackathon. Through these events, companies have found talented individuals and created a sense of camaraderie and community among participants.\nVirtual Reality for Recruitment\nVirtual reality (VR) is a technology that allows people to immerse themselves in a digital environment that simulates a real world or an unbelievable one. It creates a feeling of presence that can be incredibly powerful, as anyone who’s tried VR can attest. However, when it comes to recruitment, VR can be a game-changer. It allows companies to create simulations and interactive experiences that give job candidates a better sense of what it would be like to work there.\nIt can attract top talent and increase candidates’ chances of accepting job offers. Some examples of companies using VR for recruitment include L’Oréal (which created a VR experience where candidates can see what it’s like to work at the company) and Jaguar Land Rover (which made a VR test drive to give candidates a feel for what it’s like to work on the company’s vehicles).\nTalent Relationship Management\nIt is a strategy that focuses on establishing and maintaining long-term relationships with potential candidates, even if they are not currently in a position to accept an offer. The ultimate aim is to create a talent pipeline to meet the company’s future needs. As talent acquisition continues to shift from reactive to proactive, talent relationship management has become a must-have for every recruitment team.\nCompanies that invest time and resources in managing relationships with potential hires can save time and cost in the long run. This strategy can be implemented in several ways, including creating a talent community, hosting events, and targeted marketing.\nWith job seekers increasingly relying on mobile devices to access job postings and apply for positions, companies that fail to embrace mobile recruitment risk missing out on top talent. To succeed in mobile recruitment, companies must develop effective strategies that take advantage of mobile apps, text messaging, social media, and other tools.\nExamples of successful mobile recruitment abound, from companies using Facebook to target job ads to mobile apps that allow candidates to apply for jobs on the go.\nArtificial Intelligence and Machine Learning\nInstead of relying solely on human decision-making, companies can now use AI and ML to analyze vast amounts of data, identify patterns, and make predictions. For example, companies can use AI algorithms to sort through resumes and identify the most promising candidates, reducing the time and effort required for recruitment.\nAdditionally, some companies use chatbots to conduct initial interviews, allowing candidates to interact with a virtual recruiter anytime, anywhere. As AI and ML technology continue to advance, the future of recruitment looks bright. We expect to see even more innovative solutions, such as predictive analytics and cognitive assessments, to help companies find the best talent quickly and efficiently.\nIn any industry, recruitment success is vital. It can mean the difference between thriving or struggling organizations. As a result, measuring recruitment success is critical. Metrics such as cost per hire, time to fill a position, and candidate satisfaction are all worth paying attention to. They provide valuable insights into how effective recruitment efforts are, highlighting areas where improvement is needed.\nStrategies for boosting recruitment success include paying attention to the metrics and making data-driven decisions. In addition, utilizing social media platforms, being an active community member, and building relationships with candidates are just some ways to improve recruitment success.\nAs businesses adapt to the ever-changing climate, employers must be flexible about taking risks and think beyond traditional hiring strategies. Unfortunately, even though organizations might be hesitant and afraid of investing in unconventional methods without exploring new possibilities, they remain susceptible to being left behind, lagging competitors that have already taken that courageous step forward.\nIf you are considering changing your organization’s recruitment processes, we at Gables Search Group can help you.

{"id": "4733", "text": "The 2020 Election in Ohio: Continuing the Feminist Struggle for and Beyond Representation\nMaybe I’m an idealist, but I believe government has the power and responsibility to improve lives. Because of my faith in the government's potential and my commitment to feminism, I think it’s imperative that we elect leaders who will work to create a better world. So this summer, when a friend suggested I join her in applying for an internship with a state legislature campaign for the candidate Mary Lightbody, I immediately sent in my resume. Representative Lightbody’s political stances reflect many of my progressive and feminist values: she supports funding public education, access to healthcare, scientific solutions to the COVID-19 pandemic, and women’s reproductive rights.\nAnother reason why I was so excited to work on Representative Lightbody’s campaign is that she was running for re-election in my state of Ohio, where women are politically underrepresented. This matters, because when women are in political office, it often results in policy measures that reaffirm women’s human, civil, and reproductive rights.\nBut Representative Lightbody’s conservative political challenger raised questions for me about the relationship between feminism and women in politics. Representative Lightbody’s opponent was also a woman—Meredith Freedhoff—whose campaign website described her as the “only woman in the boardroom.” She, too, seemed to have shattered glass ceilings, and her election would also mean a female politician in the Ohio government. So, was this a win-win situation? Or, in other words, is women’s access to political power the primary concern of contemporary feminism and the feminism of my foremothers?\nI ask this question because feminist activism is my heritage. My great-grandmother was involved in first-wave feminism both as a suffragette challenging political norms and as a flapper challenging social norms. Her daughter, my grandmother, had to give up her dream of being a professional musician because orchestras didn’t accept women at the time. Influenced by second-wave feminism, she instead became a social worker and eventually a tenured professor, and also helped to establish a Planned Parenthood branch in Athens, Ohio.\nTwo women running as the major party candidates in a political race is something my great-grandmother could only have imagined. The normalcy with which I viewed the two candidates, both of whom had careers and children before seeking office, would have astounded my grandmother in her youth. More and more women, including Lightbody and Freedhoff, are living a reality which previous feminists worked for, a reality which was a goal of my grandmothers’ activism. Yet the outcome of the election still mattered to me and my understanding of feminism.\nAs a self-described feminist, I don’t believe in judging whether someone is a feminist based on their individual choices regarding work, religion, children, abortion, or any of the many other choices a woman makes for herself in her lifetime. To me, feminism is about having these choices and being able to determine one’s own path. However, when women gain access to power and use their power to deny rights to other women—especially women less privileged because of race, sexual orientation, gender identity, ability, or socioeconomic status—that’s not feminism.\nMeredith Freedhoff believes that Planned Parenthood should receive no government funding and most abortions should be outlawed. Meanwhile, Representative Lightbody opposes legislation that she says “will deny women dominion over their own bodies and will deny them access to quality healthcare.” Unsurprisingly, Lightbody received Planned Parenthood’s endorsement.\nMy grandmother and her contemporaries fought so ardently for reproductive justice because they understood how essential these rights are for gender equality. Second-wave feminists also recognized the consequences of unplanned pregnancy on women’s financial stability and independence—many even risked their lives to get back-alley abortions rather than give up these freedoms. And today’s fourth-wave intersectional feminists are raising awareness about the inherent racism of abortion restrictions. Electing a candidate who advocates for reproductive rights for all is just as essential as ensuring women are represented in government.\nIronically, this idea that women in power equals feminism—no matter the policies said woman stands for—has been recently espoused by conservatives as a reason to support Amy Coney Barrett’s confirmation to the Supreme Court. Like Meredith Freedhoff, Barrett is a working mom who has broken traditional norms in her career. Also like Freedhoff, Barrett is wholeheartedly committed to stripping reproductive rights from women and anyone else who can get pregnant. Barrett will use her power to limit women’s rights, and by doing so, she will act in opposition to feminism, regardless of how conservatives wish to represent her. Women like Freedhoff and Barrett have these opportunities because of feminists like my grandmothers. Conservatives wrongly equate this fact with the idea that these women who have benefited from feminism are embodiments of feminism themselves. Freedhoff and Barrett have profited from previously-shattered glass ceilings, and probably have broken some themselves. But they have proven that they will work to reinstall those barriers for other women.\nWhen Representative Lightbody won re-election, I jumped for joy. All our hard work of organizing fundraising spreadsheets, phone-banking, text-banking, and dropping off pamphlets on doorsteps had paid off. More importantly, we helped re-elect a representative who fights for women and for all Ohioans. Representative Lightbody will work to ensure that conservatives don’t undermine the achievements of feminists like my grandmother.\nWorking on this campaign underscored the importance of state and local elections, even though they may not get as much attention as federal bids. So many issues, like reproductive rights, pandemic relief and restrictions, and even housing policies, are influenced at the state and local levels. While elections are by no means the only way to make change, electing leaders who truly represent the people—politically and demographically—at all levels of government is a necessary starting point. This political race emphasized the importance of not only empowering women to overcome patriarchal barriers to power, but also empowering women to fight for other women. Through their activism, my foremothers and their peers worked to create the world I live in today, and what they accomplished is amazing; but the work of feminism is not finished. So many women were left out of those successes, and there is still much work to be done to challenge political and social norms for women today. In the spirit of my feminist heritage and my foremothers’ activism, I will work to carry on their legacy and actualize a better future for my own daughter.\nThis piece was written as part of JWA’s Rising Voices Fellowship.", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}

{"id": "4756", "text": "A research conducted by the University of Alberta on fish suggested that waiting before reaching for medications may be beneficial for humans. Letting the mild fever run its course helped the fish clear their bodies of infection rapidly (within 7 days) with controlled inflammation and repairing of damaged tissues. Since the mechanisms driving and sustaining fever are shared among animals, researchers deemed it reasonable to expect similar benefits to happen in humans.\nThis means that moderate fever is self-resolving; the body can both induce and shut down naturally without the need for medication. Giving way to the benefits of this biological response to infection includes resisting reaching for over-the-counter medications, such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, at the first signs of mild temperature.\nIn the experiment, fish were given a bacterial infection. Their behavior was tracked and evaluated using machine learning. Outward symptoms were comparable to those observed in humans with fever, including immobility, malaise and fatigue. These were then matched to important immune mechanisms inside the animals.\nNatural fever serves as an integrative response - it helps in activating defenses and controlling infection. The research team’s next goal is to leverage these findings on other medical advances while continuing to harness the benefits from the natural mechanisms of our immunity.", "scores": {"score": 4, "score_transform_1": 5, "score_transform_2": 5, "score_transform_3": 0}}

{"id": "4803", "text": "Laser Tattoo Removal Brisbane\nLLC Cosmetics specialises in efficient and reliable laser tattoo removal - our state-of-the-art lasers deliver a quick, relatively painless and highly efficient removal of your unwanted tattoos.\nQuick and affordable tattoo removal\nTattoos are a means of expression and have been so for centuries. Laser is a widely accepted tool for tattoo removal, and the latest advent in Q-Switch technology has revolutionised the tattoo removal process by making it faster, less uncomfortable and increasingly effective with low downtimes.\nHow does our tattoo removal work?\nJust like pigmentation treatments, the principle of laser tattoo removal is selective photothermolysis. This process allows the lasers to destroy a specific pigment in the skin by using a specific wavelength. The shattered pigment is then absorbed by the body’s lymphatic system, lightening the tattoo at each treatment.\nWhat is involved in one of our tattoo removal sessions?\nA few hours before your treatment, you may be required to have some pain killers to keep you comfortable during the procedure. You may request to use a numbing gel on the day or have your treatment done without one. Most patients do not require numbing, as the treatment is a very quick procedure and is relatively less painful when compared to older models of tattoo removal machines.\nDuring treatment, a Q-switch laser pulse is scanned along the entire treatment area, breaking the ink into tiny fragments. After your prescribed number of treatments, you will notice the pigment in the tattoos will fade away, leaving a ghosting appearance of the original tattoo.\nHow many tattoo removal sessions do you need?\nDepending on the type of tattoo (amateur or professional), colour of the ink and area of treatment; tattoo removal sessions can be as little as three sessions or as many as 10-15 sessions, spaced 4-8 weeks apart.\nAmateur tattoos are more superficial and only require a few sessions to clear. Bright colours are not easily removed due to absorption limitations with the lasers, and areas such as feet and fingers that have a lower blood supply can take longer to clear the ink from your system.\nA free consultation is the best way to ensure you receive the most optimal care and tailored information on how many sessions will be required – this allows us to set clear expectations for tattoo clearance depending on your goals. Post treatment care is a must for optimal results.\nIs laser tattoo removal safe?\nYes. In the hands of our expert LLC Cosmetic Laser Clinics technicians, this procedure is very safe. The laser needs to be absorbed into the ink and not the surrounding skin (failure to do so can lead to serious burns). This makes it imperative that a tattoo removal technician has the skills, licencing, and knowledge to ensure safe treatment and quality outcomes for their clients. At LLC Cosmetics in Brisbane, we are fully qualified and highly experienced in safe and reliable laser tattoo removals.\nDoes tattoo removal hurt?\nUnfortunately, no method of removing a tattoo is pain-free. The deep-seated ink needs to be broken down into smaller fragments for the body to clear away, and this requires a lot of energy delivered in short pulses. Patients describe this as a sharp and prickly sensation or a rubber band snapping against the skin. A numbing gel is offered to keep you comfortable during the process should you wish.", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

{"id": "4847", "text": "A lot of people want to be good at the guitar, but not everyone is. Everyone wants to play lightning fast, but not everyone is able despite practicing long hours. Why is this?\nThe most common advice about How to Develop Speed on the Guitar is to play everything painfully slowly, use a metronome, and build speed incrementally over time. It makes sense. It sounds reasonable. But why is it that out of the thousands of guitar players trying to improve their right and left-hand speed, only a slight percentage can get impressive results?\nThe information available on the internet, guitar sites, and forums, as well as favorite books, many of which are about sports or physical activity and are associated with scientific research, generally say the same thing.\nBut the majority of guitarists that I had known who have used this method either give up out of boredom and frustration or develop repetitive stress injury and never improve the speed they want.\nMany will incorrectly conclude they don’t have the talent. Or worse rationalize how playing fast is not that important. Then settle for mediocrity.\nGetting fast on the guitar is easier than you think\nI wrote an ebook called Developing Speed where I outline some of the problems you likely face that is common to most guitarists and how you can overcome the obstacles holding you back.\nDeveloping speed on the guitar is likely easier for you to achieve than you think. What’s usually missing, nine times out of ten, are two crucial things.\nOne is a structured approach to playing and practicing. The other is focussing on weakness.\nYou are likely much closer to your goals than you realize, but there is something that you are unable to see standing in your way. When you focus on your weaknesses, your faults usually grow bigger. You might have heard the saying, “where attention goes, energy flows.”\nThe key is to focus on your strengths\nBy focussing on where you are naturally strong, you keep your mind free of fear. Your starting point is already more positive and will have more momentum than if you look at where you are weak and try to fix it.\nYour moods and mental well-being will massively affect your progress. Your moods are not determined by your where you are right now, but rather, where you are going. This is why goals are so important. Your mental strength is determined by your trajectory.\nWhen you give attention to your weaknesses you tend to look backwards. You come to practice with a feeling of scarcity and fear. Youre not sure if you can do it or not.\nIn contrast when you start from a position of strength you feel good right from the beginning. It feels more natural to you and therefore you have more confidence. This is key.\nThe second thing holding you back is a lack of structure. You need a framework for both playing and practicing.\nFrameworks are robust and are something you already use on a daily basis. For example, your alarm goes off. You get out of bed. You have a morning routine. You go to work or school. You likely do the same things on most days.\nThis is a framework. The school is a framework. Your workplace is also a framework.\nWhen you write an essay or a blog post you use a framework like an intro, body, conclusion. Songwriters and composers use frameworks to write songs. Songs themselves are essentially frameworks consisting of intro, verse, chorus, outro.\nApplying a framework to how you play and how you practice, will eliminate a lot of randomnesses and accelerate your progress.\nWhat I teach in this book Developing Speed is conceptual. The licks and examples may be technically beneath you. But what I want to convey is the approach I took to improving. The biggest changes coincided with a massive shift in my mindset.\nHere are some of the things that I address in the book:\n- One powerful secret I learned from my teacher Greg Howe about speed\n- The one thing you should focus on to play fast\n- Why playing slow does not make you fast and what does\n- How to develop blazing speed over the long term without injury\n- Why do people not get fast even though they practice all the time\n- How to use space and time to sound fast\n- How to use intervals to create speed\n- Easy ways to shift scale positions\n- Licks and examples\nYou can immediately download this book for free as well as access an ongoing growing training library of ebooks, video, and more\nWhen you claim your free membership, you’ll get instant access to a treasure chest of proven training\nOnce you register, you’ll have continuous access to the resource library via the username and password you choose.

{"id": "4849", "text": "With two weeks of preseason testing complete and with the season-opening Australian Grand Prix (25 March) little more than a week away, only one thing seems certain: Mercedes is still quick.\nThe field is expected to tighten at the front in the second year of stable aerodynamic regulations, but preseason testing form — admittedly a vague metric subject to the usual showboating and sandbagging — appears to have dampened hopes.\nFerrari, last year’s title challenger, and Red Bull Racing have reason for optimism, having set competitive times and having put in strong on-track showings across the eight days of testing, but these all come with important caveats.\nIn particular Ferrari, the fastest car by the end of testing, bettered the previous lap record of Spain’s Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya by 1.2 seconds, but this was a mixture of circumstance and classic Scuderia showboating.\nThe Italian team used Pirelli’s new hypersoft tyres — the fastest compound the manufacturer has ever developed — to set its best time on the final day of testing, and the newly resurfaced circuit is estimated by some drivers to be worth as much as two seconds per lap.\nRed Bull Racing set the third quickest time of the fortnight, almost 0.9 seconds off the pace, but what appears to be a potent aerodynamic concept is being hamstrung by the underpowered Renault engine bolted into the back.\nIndeed GPS data reportedly suggests the RB14 was quicker than Ferrari’s SF71H in every corner of the circuit, losing time only on the straights.\nBut lap time certainly isn’t everything, and for proof look no further than Mercedes’s best effort, which was more than 1.2 seconds slower than Ferrari’s fastest lap.\nMercedes, however, set its best time on the ultrasoft tyres, which is one step harder and approximately 0.8 seconds slower than the hypersoft compound. Moreover, the Silver Arrows spent most of their time in race simulation, never attempting a low-fuel glory run.\nWhat Mercedes did prove, however, is that its class-leading power unit is bulletproof, completing 1040 laps, over 100 more than any other constructor. With teams allowed just three engines for the entire season in 2018, Mercedes’s dedication to distance is sure to pay dividends.\nThe fight for supremacy is by no means over, but an early Mercedes head start could be enough to undo the title ambitions of its rivals.\nBut even if Mercedes hegemony seems likely, substantially less certain is the order of the rest of the field.\nMcLaren, which has spent the off-season backing itself as a dark horse after switching from the unreliable Honda engines to Renault power, completed the fewest laps of any team after a string of reliability problems.\nToro Rosso, however, which traded its Renault engines for a partnership with the maligned Honda, was the third most prolific team by laps in testing, marking a major improvement in the Japanese supplier’s fortunes. Regular points contention is the team’s new goal.\nBut perhaps the greatest intrigue is saved for Haas, the American-owned team in its third year of competition.\nHaas’s aerodynamic concept looked restrained at launch, but its sure-footedness on track was paired with some impressive lap times, and indeed the VF-18’s fastest lap, corrected for using a harder-compound tyres, would put its performance in line with Ferrari.\nWith Renault growing stronger by the day and with Force India expected to bring a significant upgrade package to Melbourne, the fight for fourth place in the constructors standings, best of the rest behind the three frontrunning teams, is more uncertain than ever before.\nIt makes for a fascinating set-up to next weekend’s Australian Grand Prix and the 2018 Formula One season.", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

{"id": "4904", "text": "WASHINGTON, D.C. -- Americans' confidence in all three branches of the U.S. government has fallen, reaching record lows for the Supreme Court (30%) and Congress (7%), and a six-year low for the presidency (29%). The presidency had the largest drop of the three branches this year, down seven percentage points from its previous rating of 36%.\nThese data come from a June 5-8 Gallup poll asking Americans about their confidence in 16 U.S. institutions -- within government, business, and society -- that they either read about or interact with.\nWhile Gallup recently reported a historically low rating of Congress, Americans have always had less confidence in Congress than in the other two branches of government. The Supreme Court and the presidency have alternated being the most trusted branch of government since 1991, the first year Gallup began asking regularly about all three branches.\nBut on a relative basis, Americans' confidence in all three is eroding. Since June 2013, confidence has fallen seven points for the presidency, four points for the Supreme Court, and three points for Congress. Confidence in each of the three branches of government had already fallen from 2012 to 2013.\nConfidence in the presidency is now the lowest it has been under President Barack Obama, as is confidence in Congress and the Supreme Court, given their historical lows. When Obama first took office in 2009, each of the three branches saw a jump in confidence from their dismally low ratings in George W. Bush's final two years in the White House.\nConfidence in the Presidency, From George H.W. Bush to Obama\nThe president in office is not mentioned by name when the presidential confidence question is asked, but how positively Americans evaluate the current president has a direct impact on how much confidence Americans place in the presidency as an institution.\nGallup began asking regularly about the presidency in March 1991, when George H.W. Bush was in office. At that time, 72% of Americans had confidence in the presidency -- the highest confidence rating the institution has received. This was immediately following his leadership in the successful first Persian Gulf War, and at a time when his job approval rating hit the then all-time high of 89%. But the elder Bush also saw the largest drop in confidence for the institution that same year, when it fell to a still relatively high 50% in October 1991.\nThe three presidents who would succeed him would go on to be elected to two terms, with varying degrees of confidence in the executive branch of the U.S. government during those terms. Obama garnered the greatest first-year confidence rating, at 51% in 2009, but has held lower ratings than both Bill Clinton and George W. Bush in each subsequent year of his presidency so far.\nGeorge W. Bush's presidency commanded the highest first-term confidence ratings due to the post-9/11 surge in support for government leaders and institutions, marked by a record job approval rating of 90% for Bush in September 2001 and continued high ratings for him in the months thereafter. His second-term approval ratings plummeted, however, and so did confidence in the presidency, reaching an all-time low of 25% in 2007.\nClinton had higher approval ratings during his second term thanks to a strong economy, and confidence ratings for the presidency improved as well. Compared with the sixth-year low that the presidency has reached under Obama this year, confidence in the institution registered at 53% for Clinton in June 1998. Even in the thick of the Monica Lewinsky scandal that year, Americans' confidence in the presidency remained higher than for either of his successors in their sixth years in office.\nNew Low for Confidence in the U.S. Supreme Court\nGallup has tracked confidence in the Supreme Court since 1973. The institution's record high of 56% was reached twice, in 1985 and 1988 -- both times under former President Ronald Reagan. By 1988, Reagan had made all four of his contributions to the Supreme Court's roster of confirmed justices.\nFrom 1973 to 2006, the Supreme Court maintained confidence ratings in the 40s and 50s in all but one poll. That changed in 2007, a year after George W. Bush's second confirmed nominee to the court -- the Supreme Court's confidence rating dropped sharply to 34%, along with similar declines in confidence in the other two branches of government. It has not reached 40% since.\nIn recent years, the presidency and the Supreme Court have often been closely rated in confidence by Americans, and in most polls since 1991, the two branches of government have been within six or seven points of each other in confidence ratings.\nWhile Americans clearly have the lowest amount of confidence in the legislative branch, ratings for all three are down and are at or near their lowest points to date. At this point, Americans place much greater faith in the military and the police than in any of the three branches of government.\nMembers of Congress are likely resigned to the fact that they are the most distrusted institution of government, but there should be concern that now fewer than one in 10 Americans have confidence in their legislative body. And Obama, like the younger Bush before him, is surely aware that the presidency's low confidence rating is not auspicious for his ability to govern and rally the public behind his favored policies.\nWhile the Supreme Court, with unelected justices serving indefinite terms, is immune to the same public pressures that elected members of Congress and the president must contend with, it is not immune to the drop in confidence in U.S. government institutions that threatens and complicates the U.S. system of government.\nResults for this Gallup poll are based on telephone interviews conducted June 5-8, 2014, with a random sample of 1,027 adults, aged 18 and older, living in all 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia.\nFor results based on the total sample of national adults, the margin of sampling error is ±4 percentage points at the 95% confidence level.\nInterviews are conducted with respondents on landline telephones and cellular phones, with interviews conducted in Spanish for respondents who are primarily Spanish-speaking. Each sample of national adults includes a minimum quota of 50% cellphone respondents and 50% landline respondents, with additional minimum quotas by time zone within region. Landline and cellular telephone numbers are selected using random-digit-dial methods. Landline respondents are chosen at random within each household on the basis of which member had the most recent birthday.\nSamples are weighted to correct for unequal selection probability, nonresponse, and double coverage of landline and cell users in the two sampling frames. They are also weighted to match the national demographics of gender, age, race, Hispanic ethnicity, education, region, population density, and phone status (cellphone only/landline only/both, and cellphone mostly). Demographic weighting targets are based on the most recent Current Population Survey figures for the aged 18 and older U.S. population. Phone status targets are based on the most recent National Health Interview Survey. Population density targets are based on the most recent U.S. census.

{"id": "5036", "text": "In this episode, you'll learn:\nSubmit 30-second audio with your name, what you do, and where people can find you OR you send me a script and I read it on the podcast!\nToday I want to talk about how I set goals. Because I feel like that might be helpful to some of you and I know we all have heard of the smart goal method, right where you do all the measurements and tracking. But over the years I realized that that may not work for the creatives, because we don't necessarily care about the metrics of things. We just want to know that we have a goal, we know how to make it happen, and we kind of know how to get there oftentimes we don't, but you know!\nSo one of the things that I did when I first started getting really serious about my goals and figuring out how I can really call in what I wanted to be, do and have in this life. And so I spent the day journaling and just writing down everything that I want to achieve. It's sort of like like looking back, so if you imagine yourself in a rocking chair and reflect back on your life and acknowledge all of your achievements, except I did it sort of like in a year span. So you sit down and make the date a year from today and then \"since this day I have achieved\", and you just start freewriting uncensored, unapologetically about the things that you want to be, do and have, you know, and this includes who you're with, what you're having for breakfast. What are you doing every day? What are your daily activities? Where do you go on vacation? What kind of business things do you do? What can a life things do you do to just kinda get yourself out of that stuck zone.\nYou know, Do you want to write books, do you want to make art or do you want to make coloring books like anything like that. Or do you want to start a garden and be more self-sufficient and stop buying all the things from the grocery store? Like there's all these different things that I ended up writing about you know. Back then the Huffington Post was still around and I was like, I wanted to write for the Huffington Post and I wanted to ride my third book and create a coloring book, and I want to meet a certain income goal, and so all of these different things. And I wanted to have coffee and bed and this is one of those things that end up standing out to me, because a wrote this whole journal pages, probably like three pages worth, and looked through it.\nI ended ending up circling the things that I could call in to be, do and have goals and that, and having coffee in bed was kind of like huh, I was single at the time, my partner, and I weren't together. We were living separately and I was you know parenting my two children who were still minors and in school, and I had no idea who and how that was going to unfold. Anyway I knew how to write a book, and kind of figured out hand how to make this coloring book, I had a mind and I knew how to write an article and ended up submitting that to the Huffington Post which got published.\nAnd at about six months later my partner and we were in the process of getting back together and moving back in together. I had never ever shared that with him or I've never told him about any of my goals, I used to be really really private about that and he brought me coffee in bed and he did it the next day and the next day, and the next day. And hit me, I'm like whoa, this writing down of what you want to be, do and have in life can be really really powerful if you give it the space. If you take the time to really sit down and write it all out, even if it seems chest so crazy, it will never happen. Write it out and just follow the process.\nSit down with your cup of coffee or whatever you like to drink, pen and paper. And put the date year from now and just ride out all of your desires. Don't hold back. Don't censor yourself. Don't stay superficial. Really dive deep and acknowledge those things that you may have not shared with anybody else, let alone acknowledged for yourself, and just write it out. You don't have to share this with anybody like I didn't share any of that was my partner back then and it just unfolded, to where he brings me coffee every morning. And that's again, the power of writing things down can just be really really powerful right.\nAnd once you have those be, do and have half goals. I've mentioned you go through and read it, and then circle: Who do you want to be, what you want to do, what you and a have. Circle those things, and make a list of them. Write them down on a piece of paper, separately and in a column, if you will, and then just acknowledge all of those be, do, and have goals. And then look at them and see which one is most important to you at this particular time, which one you want to do first, and give them deadlines.\nYou know, maybe writing the book is more of a priority and so that should be your first activity, that you're going to focus on. Something that's really really helpful is to do things and ninety-day increments. So you have three months to write a book, to edit it., get it edited if you're hiring somebody, and get the cover down and start your marketing process. And ninety days absolutely doable.\nI don't necessarily follow the mainstream of marketing in many many ways. One of my books I wrote in two weeks and I will talk about that in another podcast and how you could do that as well and wrote the book, did the cover published it done, said here there's another book and that's how I like to do things. I feel like marketing can be so challenging. Gut anyway so just go look through your goals, decide which ones you would like to do when, when they feel good from more of an intuitive space instead of the gotta do all the things right now space.\nYou have time-ish right like there's time to do things, but don't put them out too far. Figure out ninety days increments. Choose one to three goals. You know you could have one from each column be doing have, per quarter to help you take action so you can stay focused, you know what you're doing for the next ninety days, and start making progress on your goals that way. This way has been really really helpful for me as a creative to follow that.\nWrite it out. Circle the be, do and have goals and then figure out which ones I want to do first, what I'm going to focus on, and when I'm going to focus on it, and I still do that with a lot of my business activity, said my list building specifically that I do, so I hope you I thought this was helpful and I will talk to you next time.\nIf you’re looking for a podcast where the host looks and feels like having it all together, always stays on topics, and is planned and strategic about all the things - then this is not the podcast for you!\nIf on the other hand, you like listening to a podcast where it feels like you're having coffee with a friend and the ability to talk ... well just about everything from life, business, creativity, mindset, and all that stuff that falls into the middle, then the Coffee with a Rebel Podcast is for you!\nSubmit 30-second audio with your name, what you do and where people can find you OR you send me a script and I read it on the podcast!\nI turned my passion into my profession!

{"id": "5043", "text": "A farmer had many logs to cut but couldn’t find his ax. He ran his yard back and forth, looked in the shed and scoured all the property, but the ax was still missing. No doubt it had been stolen! A new ax he had bought with his last savings!\nAnger seized him and painted his mind with a black ink dark as soot. Then he saw his neighbor. It seemed that his gait was that of someone who didn’t have a clear conscience. His face betrayed an expression typical of the guilty with his victim. His greeting was full of the malice of axes’ thieves. And when he opened his mouth to talk about the weather, his voice was that of a thief who had just stolen something!\nUnable to contain himself longer, the peasant crossed his porch striding, with the intention of going to quarrel with that thief who had the audacity to mock him. However, his feet tangled in a bunch of dead branches on the roadside. He stumbled noisily, banging on the nose with the handle of his ax, which must have fallen off the wagon yesterday.\nLike this farmer, often the story we baste in our mind plays tricks on us, makes us imagine things that don’t exist, leads us to blame the others or invent intentions we can’t check. Jumping to conclusions isn’t beneficial for anyone. We need equanimity!\nThe rough waters roil the bottom\nWhen we’re victims of intense emotions, such as anger or frustration, we can’t see things clearly. We aren’t able to distance the problem emotionally to appreciate what is happening from a more rational perspective. Our emotions become a veil through which we value what happens. This leads to bad or hasty decisions, which we may regret later.\nIn fact, these emotions are like a rough sea. When the waves are too strong, drag everything on their path, prevent us from seeing the bottom and, of course, don’t show our reflection. This means that we begin to act in a “reaction mode” and don’t even understand why we behave that way. We fail to realize that our attitude and thoughts aren’t determined solely by the situation but, above all, from our response to what happens.\nAt that point we stop analyzing what’s happening and begin to react to the facts we’re creating in our mind, as the peasant of the story. Thus, we misinterpret any gesture or word, because we take them as a confirmation of our beliefs. Obviously, losing this way the touch with reality isn’t positive and much less adaptive.\nEquanimity: The most useful tool to face life\nTo address specific situations, it is imperative we let the sea of our emotions get quiet, only then we’ll be able to see clearly the bottom and understand what the best solution is. But even better would be to prevent the sea from getting stirred. About that, equanimity is an excellent tool.\nEquanimity is like using the brakes to avoid getting off the curve and adjust the speed of our mind to the conditions of the road of life. But it doesn’t mean throwing the handbrake standing still while life passes by.\nHow to develop equanimity?\nEquanimity means, above all, harmony. Being fair doesn’t mean to be disinterested or adopt a passive attitude, but to provide a proportionate response to the stimuli and always trying to maintain the psychological balance. A sober person is aware that everything is mutable and therefore doesn’t cling to things, but neither rejects them, just accept everything.\nTherefore, to develop equanimity is essential to embrace the concept of change and develop a more open attitude which allows us accept what happens. This quality will allow you avoid suffering or get angry for nothing, it will help you react less intensely to negative events, so that you can live intensely the good things.", "scores": {"score": 3, "score_transform_1": 5, "score_transform_2": 5, "score_transform_3": 0}}

The most common type of tremor seen in dystonia patients is postural and kinetic which may be mistaken for familial essential tremor. Similarly familial essential tremor patients may have associated dystonia leading to diagnostic uncertainties. The pathogenesis of tremor in dystonia remains speculative, but its neurophysiological features are similar to dystonia which helps in differentiating it from essential tremor patients.

{"id": "5048", "text": "Leukocyte recruitment to sites of inflammation is initiated by their tethering and rolling on the activated endothelium under flow. Even though the fast kinetics and high tensile strength of selectin-ligand bonds are primarily responsible for leukocyte rolling, experimental evidence suggests that cellular properties such as cell deformability and microvillus elasticity actively modulate leukocyte rolling behavior. Previous theoretical models either assumed cells as rigid spheres or were limited to two-dimensional representations of deformable cells with deterministic receptor-ligand kinetics, thereby failing to accurately predict leukocyte rolling. We therefore developed a three-dimensional computational model based on the immersed boundary method to predict receptor-mediated rolling of deformable cells in shear flow coupled to a Monte Carlo method simulating the stochastic receptor-ligand interactions. Our model predicts for the first time that the rolling of more compliant cells is relatively smoother and slower compared to cells with stiffer membranes, due to increased cell-substrate contact area. At the molecular level, we show that the average number of bonds per cell as well as per single microvillus decreases with increasing membrane stiffness. Moreover, the average bond lifetime decreases with increasing shear rate and with increasing membrane stiffness, due to higher hydrodynamic force experienced by the cell. Taken together, our model captures the effect of cellular properties on the coupling between hydrodynamic and receptor-ligand bond forces, and successfully explains the stable leukocyte rolling at a wide range of shear rates over that of rigid microspheres.\nASJC Scopus subject areas", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}

He guffawed, “Everybody must pray for a recession!”\nThere is a pointedness to this anecdote today. Global interest rates have been marching higher again even as a worldwide recession appears more threatening.\nHeavily indebted Aussie households will be praying that the latter comes first.\nThe rise of housing-related inflation\nLocally, inflation has come down, but house prices have been rising simultaneously. In due course, this could lead to more robust consumption. And it may be before the economy is deflated enough to accommodate it.\nInflation is expected to fall further but less swiftly than thought a few months ago. The culprits are the oil price and housing inflation: rents, prices and construction.\nThe primary reason for rising housing-related inflation despite the highest mortgage rate in a decade is record levels of mass immigration.\nI call this ‘Alboflation’ since the government is deliberately driving breakneck population growth via generous people-to-people terms with India.\nWorse, state governments are desperately investing in infrastructure to catch up to population growth. This will add roughly 2 per cent to GDP over the next year. This makes building houses more expensive as people pay through the nose to find a tradie. That’s even before the planned expansion of public housing.\nIt is no wonder that markets have already shifted to price two more rate hikes by year-end.\nPraying for a global shock\nThe primary rationale against further interest rate hikes is a shock coming from offshore. The same backed-up bond yields driving local interest rate repricing will soon hit global growth.\nIn the US, mortgage rates are approaching 8 per cent. Business and floating rate borrowing is seeing steep rises too. This will hit the small business sector hard before long.\nIn Europe, there is already a recession, and spiking bond yields are blowing out peripheral spreads in places like Italy. The Eurozone is scheduled to cut fiscal spending steeply in 2024, and that could get much more severe if the bond market does not let up.\nIn China, the most tremendous housing crash in the history of the world is still in full roar and taking its toll on the broader economy.\nThese three factors will damage global growth and commodity prices over 2024, if not produce a financial crisis of some sort.\nNo end to housing-related inflation\nWill the global shock arrive to stop the RBA from chasing inflation with higher interest rates?\nMy guess is yes, but you never know.\nWhat we can say for sure is that Alboflation is likely to get stronger still.\nA recent scandal involving the assassination of a Sikh leader in Canada has led to India recommending that its citizens avoid that country,\nThose workers and students seeking to get offshore will now look to Australia all the more:\nIf you want to pay less on your mortgage, start praying.\nDavid Llewellyn-Smith is Chief Strategist at the MB Fund and MB Super.

Therefore, developed countries started their race to explore the outer space and try to dominate it since the sixties of the last century.\nFrom 1963, and in order to unify efforts and encourage international cooperation in the field of exploration and use of outer space, the United Nations intervened to declare the principles and issue decisions and legislation agreements that contribute to the development of mutual understanding and strength relations among nations. The United Arab Emirates has sought since its establishment to found for itself a place in outer space, eager to take advantage of the opportunities offered. Therefore, UAE established a number of national companies that deal with satellite, telecommunications, and it topped the countries Middle East in the field of communications satellites and multi-service industry such as telecommunications, television broadcasting, Internet services, earth observation and remote sensing.

This series is more than just a nail-biting cricket match; it's a crucial turning point for both teams on their quest to reach the World Test Championship summit.\nIndia, sitting comfortably at second in the WTC rankings, are cricket giants in their backyard. They haven't lost a Test series at home in over 11 years. But this is a new look for England's side from the last two tours which have garnered worldwide fame with their aggressive brand of cricket in test matches called 'Bazball'.\nCaptain Rohit Sharma has hinted at preparing spin-friendly pitches, which has sparked debate. Former England captain Nasser Hussain even warned against turning the tracks into unplayable dustbowls. He believes these \"rank turners\" would benefit England's spinners too, thanks to their aggressive Baseball approach. Instead, he suggests preparing \"good pitches that spin a bit,\" where India's batting and spin bowling prowess can truly shine.\nSpeaking of the pitches in a Sky Sports podcast Nasser Hussain said, \"I think what India should do is ask for good pitches that spin a bit because I think their spinners and batters will then out-bat and out-spin ours. If they ask for pitches that spin a lot, then it becomes a bit of a lottery and brings England’s spinners into the game. The way Bazball goes about its business, they would not die wondering.\"\nIndian pitches will be under the scanner\nIndia has garnered some criticisms in the past with the type of pitches they have been dishing to oppositions in the past, especially SENA teams. Some of the pitches have started turning from the first ball itself which in some cases nullifies the skill factor and becomes more like a lottery.\nIndia have themselves bear the brunt sometimes where they have fallen prey to their own doing such as in the ODI World Cup final or the 3rd Test match against Australia in Indore. Indian management must consider these factors before preparing pitches for the England series but apart from the pitch debate both the units look equally good and the fans are up for a grueling test series between two top test nations.", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

There’s an experiment that shows how judgment is often informed by partially reliable or even totally insignificant information – what psychologists call “the anchoring effort.” It goes like this:\nSubjects are shown a wheel of fortune. Unbeknownst to them, the wheel only stops on numbers 10 and 65. After the wheel is spun, subjects are asked a totally unrelated question: What is your best guess of the percentage of African nations in the UN? The average estimate of people who have just seen the number 10 is 25%. The average estimate of people who have just seen the number 65 is 45%. The answers are anchored by the previous information, even when there was no link between them.\n“We pass through this life on the receiving end of a steady signal of partially reliable information that we only occasionally, and under duress, evaluate thoroughly,” writes Michael Lewis in the December 2011 issue of Vanity Fair. “It’s unsettling to know that your judgment can be so heavily influenced by some random number and disturbing to realize it is probably happening all the time.”\nLewis’s article “The King of Human Error” profiles psychologist Daniel Kahneman, 2002 winner of the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences and senior scholar at the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs and professor of psychology emeritus at the same school. Kahneman is author of the new Thinking, Fast and Slow (Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 2011), which includes a passage on the wheel of fortune test.\nKahneman and his professional collaborator Amos Tversky spent the 1970s and early 80s pursing “an extraordinary number of strange and inventive experiments,” Lewis writes, which “demonstrated how essentially irrational human beings can be.” It is their work that helps explain much of what Lewis detailed in his 2003 book Moneyball, the story of how a handful of executives in the baseball world had begun using statistics and analytics to identify overlooked and still-valuable players.

Freshman Cam Gust smacked his first career home run before HNU made a late-game run.\nIn the top of the seventh, HNU scored three runs and took the lead from Dixie. The Storm exploded in the following two frames, scoring eight unanswered runs, including a Donald Glover Jr. solo homer, to edge Hawks on Saturday, 11-9.\nSenior infielder Kevin Kline, recently named National Collegiate Baseball Writers Association West Region Player of the Week, homered in the second game, a two-run shot that gave DSU a 6-2 lead. Freshman pitcher Dylan File earned the victory from the mound, the second of his career. Kline gives the credit for his strong play to his teammates.\n“It’s a lot easier when the guys in front of me apply pressure,” Kline said. “It puts the pitchers on their heels when I’m batting.”\nLooking to close out a clean sweep of HNU, Dixie faced the Hawks in yet another doubleheader on Sunday.\nIn game one, the Storm started off hot. RBI singles from sophomore Trey Kamachi and Glover Jr. put DSU up 2-0. McLaughlin went 3-4 for the second time in the series, leading DSU to the 10-3 victory. Head coach Chris Pfatenhauer said he was extremely happy about the team’s performance.\n“It was a great weekend,” Pfatenhauer said. “We played really well in all aspects of the game. We had great starting pitching, awesome defense, strong at-bats, and we capitalized on their [HNU] mistakes. I’m very pleased.”\nIn the fourth and final game of the series, Holy Names fell apart. The Hawks allowed four runs on three errors in the opening inning. Junior Tanner Morache went 3-3 to lead the Storm to the 6-2 win, the 16th win in the last 17 games.\nDSU is now 11-1 in conference play and 16-8 overall. It will continue its homestand with a doubleheader against the Academy of Art on Friday.\nRiding a 19 game winning streak, DSU softball opened up a 4-game series with the Academy of Art on Friday.\nSenior pitcher Michelle Duncan continued her dominant play from the circle, winning her 15th game on the season 12-0.\n“We’re coming together as a team,” Duncan said. “We’re stringing together hits and playing good defense. It’s a testament to the whole team.”\nSenior second basemen Nicole Chavez went 2-3, and catcher Marla Reiter converted on both her at bats, both plating three RBI’s.\nIn the second game of the series, junior Aryn Feickert would make history. Feickert struck out seven of the first nine batters she faced, on the way to the first perfect game in DSU Division II history. Sophomore shortstop Josey Hartman added to the 8-0 victory with a home run over the left field wall in the final inning. Head coach Randy Simkins spoke highly of the performance afterward.\n“She was very good today,” Simkins said. “She was aggressive and made them swing at her pitches.”\nThe Red Storm looked to continue their outstanding play on Saturday with another doubleheader against A of A.\nDSU put on a clinic in the first inning, scoring five runs early on. Dixie State exploded again in the third, putting another five runs across the plate. Reiter capped off the hot start with a solo homer on the way to the 10-1 win.\nThe final game was a high-scoring affair, in which the two teams combined for four home runs. Junior catcher Autumn Woodfall smacked the lone long-ball for DSU. A of A answered back with a four-run fourth inning.\nThe Storm countered with five runs in the next two innings, but this time A of A would not have an answer. Feickert earned her 12th victory, and DSU extended its winning streak to 23 games in the 11-6 win.\nNow ranked No. 5 in the country, DSU will head to Cedar City to take on Division I opponent Southern Utah University on March 25.", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

{"id": "5264", "text": "As many of you already know, I was born in Colombia where I also spent most of my childhood, so it’s no surprise that I had never heard of sabajón until a few years ago when one of my friends mentioned it in one of our conversations. Sabajón is the Colombian version of what most of us know here in the US as “eggnog” but it contains either white rum or Colombian aguardiente. Aguardiente literally translates to “burning water” or “fire water”, and it is an anise flavored liqueur made with sugar cane. So why is it called “burning water”? Simply because it is STRONG, which is the reason I prefer to make my sabajón with white rum.\nBesides the use of aguardiente, the difference between the eggnog recipes I have made over the years and sabajón is that in Colombia it is made with not only egg yolks but also sweetened condensed milk. The first time I made it I wasn’t sure if it was going to be thick or smooth enough but let me tell you, the condensed milk really makes a difference and it is soooooo good!\nSo, if you want to add one more Christmas Colombian recipe to your holidays, make sure you add this sabajón recipe to your list. Serve it cold along with some hojuelas, buñuelos, natilla, empanadas or tamales. I’m sure your guests will love it!\n- 5 cups (1.2 liter) whole milk\n- ¼ cup (50 g) white granulated sugar\n- 3 cinnamon sticks\n- 5 large egg yolks\n- 1 14 oz. can (396 g) sweetened condensed milk\n- ½ cup (120 ml) white rum or aguardiente, optional (add more if you prefer)\n- 1 tsp vanilla extract\n- Ground cinnamon for garnishing\n- Add the milk, sugar and cinnamon sticks to a large pot and bring to a simmer at medium low heat.\n- In the meantime, beat egg yolks and condensed milk in a medium bowl.\n- Once the milk begins to simmer, add a few tablespoons of the hot milk to the egg yolk mixture and stir well to temper it. Then add it to the hot milk and stir again. Cook on medium low heat, stirring occasionally for about 10 minutes or until it thickens.\n- Remove the pot from the stove, take out the cinnamon sticks and strain the eggnog through a sieve into a large bowl. This will remove any clumps or cinnamon pieces that may be left in the mixture. Let it cool completely.\n- Once cool, add the rum or aguardiente (if using) and the vanilla, stir well and refrigerate, preferably overnight before serving. Serve chilled and garnish with ground cinnamon on top.\nTempering the egg mixture before adding it to the hot milk will prevent the egg yolks from cooking and turning into scrambled eggs.", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

And now, Director Luv Ranjan has come up with a sequel to it named ‘Pyaar Ka Punchnama 2’. The trailer of the film is out and it’s simply hilarious.\nThe previous part of the movie showed some amazing bromance between the characters and the boys shared a great chemistry. However, in the second part, apart from Kartik Aaryan, the other two boys have been replaced with Sunny Singh and Omkar Kapoor. We hope the new boys will maintain the same pace and won’t let us feel the absence of Divyendu Sharma and Raayo S Bakhirta.\nThe film is about three bachelors who fell in love with the girl of their dreams until they felt that their dreams have turned into nightmares. They suffer terribly in their own ways and realize that the word ‘relationship’ indeed is a synonym for a roller coaster ride. The film is set to release on 16th October, 2015. Can’t wait to catch up on this hilarious flick when it hits the theaters 😀\nDid you enjoy watching the trailer?

{"id": "5326", "text": "Very little has appeared in the UK media recently about the continuing plight of Mordechai Vanunu, the Israeli nuclear whistleblower, since the broadcast on BBC Radio 4’s afternoon play ‘Vanunu: A Time To Be Heard’ in early March, which focussed on Mordechai’s release in 2004 after 18 years in prison and on the journalist, Peter Hounam subsequent meeting with Mordechai again.\nSince then Jeremy Corbyn MP has circulated a Commons early day motion on 27 April (EDM1757) which reads as follows: ‘That this House notes that 21 April 2011 marked seven years since Mordechai Vanunu was released from Ashkelon prison having served his full sentence of 18 years for revealing the truth about Israel’s nuclear weapons programme; further notes that he faces no further charges and yet since his release he has continued to be subject to severe restrictions on his human rights on freedom of movement, speech and association; requests that the Government condemns these ongoing restrictions; and calls on the Israeli government to recognise Vanunu’s full human rights by allowing him to leave Israel forthwith, as he has so often declared to be his wish.’ You can help Mordechai by writing to your MP getting them to support the motion (to date 27 MPs have signed).\nMeanwhile journalist Duncan Campbell (who was also in Israel when Mordechai was released in 2004) has written the following article, which appeared in yesterday’s ‘Comment is Free’ on the Guardian web site. It updates us on Mordechai’s current situation following his request to the Israeli Minister of the Interior, to have his citizenship revoked.\nWe must help Vanunu live in peace\nDuncan Campbell guardian.co.uk, Monday 6 June 2011\nNuclear whistleblower Mordechai Vanunu wants to obey Israeli law and lose his citizenship. The UK has an obligation to him.\nTwenty-five years ago Mordechai Vanunu, a young Israeli nuclear technician, came to London to pass on information to a British newspaper about a secret nuclear weapons facility at which he had been working and about which he believed the world should know. In the course of the next few weeks he was lured abroad to Rome, grabbed by the Israeli security service, drugged and smuggled illegally out of the country to stand trial for aggravated espionage, high treason and assisting the enemy. He was jailed for 18 years, most of which he spent in solitary confinement.\nSince his release from prison in 2004, Vanunu has been trying to leave Israel. Now he has written to the Israeli minister of the interior, Eli Yishai, asking if he can revoke his Israeli citizenship. In his letter, he points out that the Knesset has just passed a law that revokes the citizenship of anyone convicted of espionage or treason. Applying this logic, Vanunu has duly asked for the cancellation of his own.\n“This law applies to me and I am ready for my citizenship to be cancelled,” he explains in the letter. “After all the ‘treatment’ that I have received from the state of Israel and its citizens, I do not feel, here, as a citizen or how a citizen should feel, I feel as an unwelcome citizen and treated as such by the state of Israel and its citizens. I am called and shouted at as a spy, ‘the Atom Spy’, and a traitor by the Israeli media and in the streets of Israel. I am harassed and persecuted as the enemy of the state for 25 years. I feel I am still imprisoned, still held as a hostage, by the state and its government. After 25 years of ongoing, many and very hard punishments by the state of Israel, I wish the end to all punishments and my suffering, and wish the realisation of the basic human right to freedom.”\nThe argument that has been used by the Israeli government against him being allowed to leave is that he could still pass on damaging secrets to a foreign power. In his letter, Vanunu moves into capital letters to dispute this: “I HAVE NO SECRETS! EVERYTHING I KNEW THEN I HAVE PASSED ON TO THE ENGLISH PAPER IN 1986 !!”\nIndeed, no one – unless they are completely ignorant of the case – genuinely believes that he has any secrets up his sleeve. He is refused permission to leave the country not for security reasons but as a further penalty, a punishment for coming out of prison as committed to his non-violent, anti-nuclear-weaponry principles as when he went in. This is how the old Soviet Union treated its dissidents, obstructing and humiliating them in the hope that they eventually crack or die.\nDaniel Ellsberg, who risked an equivalent amount of time in prison for his own leaking of the Pentagon Papers in 1971 in the United States, has called Vanunu “the pre-eminent hero of the nuclear era … He paid the full price, a burden in some ways worse than death, for his heroic act for doing exactly what he should have done and what others should be doing.” He is among the many voices now calling for Vanunu to be allowed to live a normal life in a country of his choice.\nLast week, Julian Assange was awarded the Martha Gellhorn prize for journalism for his work with WikiLeaks. The award recognised that the leaking of information about secret governmental activity – wherever that government may be – makes for a better world.\nBritain has a responsibility towards Vanunu, a man who gave his story to a British newspaper – the Sunday Times – and whose kidnap and removal from Italy started on the streets of London; Israel had not wanted to embarrass Margaret Thatcher’s government by carrying out the deed in the UK. It is time that the British government recognised the British link and spoke up for a man who risked his freedom and his sanity because of his hatred of nuclear weapons. And high time that a peaceful man in a violent world was allowed to live his own life in peace.\nguardian.co.uk © Guardian News and Media Limited 2011", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}

{"id": "5440", "text": "Right now, just one of the substantial goals in MEP engineering design and style for HVAC structure engineers is to make improvements to power performance, sustain air high quality and thermal comfort and ease. Energy effectiveness, air high quality and comfort in a building depend on how heating, cooling and air distribution methods are made and this is exactly where thorough ductwork design and style plays a significant purpose. Ductwork and HVAC technique layout are important as it ensures indoor air good quality, thermal consolation and air flow. If the HVAC procedure and ducts are not designed accurately, it could direct to bad air excellent, warmth reduction and make the conditioned place in the setting up not comfortable.\nThe key operate of the ductwork structure method is to make sure a minimum obtrusive channel is furnished by which interesting and warm air can travel. When designed properly, HVAC air distribution units will play an critical part in countering warmth strength losses, retaining indoor air quality (IAQ) and providing thermal ease and comfort.\nTo understand how ductwork can be developed in a charge-powerful and productive fashion, this write-up decodes ductwork style and gives a transient outline of the layout procedure, approaches and specifications.\nWhat is Ductwork?\nThe basic basic principle of ductwork layout is to warmth, amazing or ventilate a building in the most economical and charge-powerful way. The main purpose of ductwork is to style and design conduits or passages that allow for air movement to offer heating, cooling, air flow and air conditioning (HVAC).\nIn the duct design system, the essentials of air move need to be recognized. Return air goes into an air handler unit (AHU), as a result of a filter and into the blower and with pressure it goes by way of the A coil or warmth exchanger and then it goes out into the offer air process. If the ductwork is built correctly it permits the AHU to deliver the appropriate amount of money of air through the heat exchanger. In a common air distribution program, ducts should accommodate offer, return and exhaust air move. Supply ducts give air expected for air conditioning and ventilation, return ducts offer controlled air to retain IAQ and temperature and exhaust air move techniques give ventilation.\nFor ductwork layout to be efficient, MEP engineering design groups want to have designers with a mechanical and engineering background. Ductwork design and style experts or setting up service engineers should also possess comprehensive knowledge of other disciplines these types of as architectural, civil and structural concepts to ensure HVAC methods are clash cost-free.\nThe Ductwork Design and style Course of action\nThe ducting method structure approach is uncomplicated, presented that the technical specs are obviously talked about and the inputs about software, activity, making orientation and setting up materials are offered. Primarily based on the data offered calculations can be completed to develop an energy-productive and clash-absolutely free structure. Generally, air conditioning and distribution programs are designed to fulfil 3 key necessities this kind of as:\n• It must supply air stream at precise premiums and velocity to stipulated locations.\n• It need to be energy efficient and expense powerful.\n• It ought to provide comfort and ease and not produce disturbance or objectionable noise.\nThe procedure of ductwork design and style starts as soon as architectural layouts and inside layout programs are supplied by the customer or MEP consultants. Constructing service engineers then need specification requirements these kinds of as application, the amount of people, the orientation of the constructing and architectural traits to make calculations on heat load and air flow. Prior to any calculations are carried out, one line drawings are drafted to showcase the movement of ductwork in the setting up. Once they are authorised, calculations for heat load and air move are performed. As soon as the heat load calculations are finish, the air stream premiums that are necessary are known and the air retailers are fastened. With the calculations, requirements and structure, the ducting technique style and design structure is then intended taking into thing to consider architectural and structural facts of the conditioned house and clashes with other developing solutions this kind of as electrical, plumbing (hydraulic) and mechanical expert services.\nTo get started the ductwork design approach there are inputs essential relating to aspects about the kind of application, specification necessities, constructing orientation, architectural attribute and substance.\n• Software variety – Ductwork style will vary based on the form of software the constructing will be utilized for these as manufacturing, facts centres, medical programs, scientific exploration and convenience purposes these types of as eating places, places of work, residences, institutional setting up this sort of as faculties and universities.\n• Specification need – To make an productive duct style and design, designers want to know what kind of activity will be performed and the regular variety of persons that will use the conditioned place. This will assist in calculating the air move, velocity and warmth load required to preserve temperatures and IAQ. In consolation purposes, for instance, an place of work or cafe will need diverse duct structure and air velocity than a home.\n• Orientation and material of the building – The orientation of building and product utilized performs a key position in gauging warmth absorption which will aid decide the cooling and ventilation requirements. Dependent on whether or not a developing faces north, south, east or west, and where it is geographically positioned, heat absorption can be calculated. The kind of content used for construction also influences the total of heat acquire and decline of the setting up.\nThe difficulties of incomplete inputs or non-availability of expected inputs are mentioned in an impending report on Ductwork Layout Issues and Suggestions.\nDuctwork Design Strategies\nDuctwork design and style procedures are generally determined centered on the expense, requirements, specifications and power performance benchmarks. Based mostly on the load of the duct from air pressure, duct techniques can commonly be categorized into superior velocity, medium velocity and lower velocity programs. There are three frequently utilized techniques for duct layout:\n1. Regular Velocity System – This strategy, made to sustain minimal velocity, is 1 of the most straightforward means to layout duct units for source and return air ducts. Even so, it demands practical experience to use this strategy as the incorrect selection of velocities, duct sizes and alternative of fixtures could boost the value. What’s more, to preserve the very same fee of strain drop in duct runs, this technique involves partial closure of dampers in duct operates (except index run) which could have an impact on efficiency.\n2. Equal Friction Process – This conventional method used for the two source and return ducts maintains the exact frictional tension drop across primary and department ducts. This technique assures dissipation of strain drops as friction in duct runs somewhat than in balancing dampers. Nevertheless, like the velocity system, partial closure of dampers is essential and this could lead to sound technology.\n3. Static Get back Method – This system commonly utilized for substantial provide systems with very long ducts is a higher velocity system that maintains frequent static stress ahead of every department or terminal. Although this is a balanced system as it does not involve dampering, more time ducts may well impact air distribution to conditioned areas.\nWhen various duct design techniques employed differ from software to software, duct system efficiency and program balancing and optimisation need to be viewed as. Immediately after the air managing device (AHU) is set up, the technique needs to be balanced and optimised to enrich general performance. In process balancing and optimisation, air flow premiums of source air outlets and return air inlets are measured, and dampers and admirer velocity are adjusted. Especially in big properties, balancing air conditioning units may well be expensive and time-consuming, but it is necessary as it offers positive aspects that outweigh the cost incurred in putting in the process. To minimise full and functioning expense, many optimisation procedures are used as these as the T-Process Optimisation explained in the DA3 Software Handbook of AIRAH (Australian Institute of Refrigeration Air Conditioning).\nTo layout air distribution techniques that are electricity economical and value efficient, HVAC process types will have to incorporate basic engineering suggestions and adhere to specified layout criteria. Let us look at some of the guidelines and specifications utilised in the sector in distinctive international locations.\nDuctwork Design Requirements\nWhen developing air conditioning systems, HVAC style engineers need to be educated about the standard procedures, rules and standards relevant, from the variety of units utilized, calculations necessary, approaches of development, kind of substance, duct program layouts, strain losses, duct leakage, sounds criteria to optimisation making use of tests, changing and balancing (TAB). Shown down below are some of the expectations organisations and associations in the U.S., U.K., Australia and India, that provide manuals, codes and requirements for the HVAC marketplace.\n• SMACNA (Sheet Metal and Air Conditioning Contractors’ Countrywide Affiliation) – It gives a manual on HVAC systems duct design and style that consists of simple however elementary procedures and treatments with relevance on vitality performance and conservation. Whilst the manual does not include load calculations and air air flow quantities, it is generally made use of in conjunction with the ASHRAE Fundamentals Handbook.\n• ASHRAE (American Modern society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers) – It is an affiliation that emphasises on the sustainability of constructing devices by concentrating on energy efficiency and indoor air high quality. The ASHRAE Handbook is a 4-volume information that offers the fundamentals of refrigeration, applications, units and devices. Up-to-date each individual four many years, the handbook involves international models of measurement these kinds of as SI (techniques worldwide) and I-P (inch-pound).\n• CIBSE (The Chartered Institution of Making Expert services Engineers) – is the authority in the British isles that sets benchmarks for developing solutions engineering techniques. The Codes and Suggestions published by CIBSE are recognised internationally and deemed as the criteria for ideal procedures in the places of sustainability, development and engineering.\n• BSRIA (Building Products and services Research and Data Association) – is an association that provides expert services that help organizations improve their styles to maximize energy efficiency in adherence to Making Restrictions, mock-up screening of programs and BIM aid.\n• AIRAH (Australian Institute of Refrigeration Air Conditioning) – gives complex manuals for industry experts in the HVAC marketplace and info ranging from air conditioning load estimation, ductwork for air conditioning, pipe sizing, centrifugal pumps, noise management, admirers, air filters, cooling towers, h2o cure, maintenance, indoor air good quality and creating commission.\n• BIS (Bureau of Indian Standards) – is a countrywide authority that supplies requirements and recommendations as for every the Global Organization for standardisation (ISO). The handbooks by BIS stipulates the code of procedures relevant to the HVAC sector these kinds of as security code for air conditioning, specification for air ducts, thermostats for use in air conditioners, metallic duct do the job, air-cooled warmth exchangers and information for outdoors design conditions for air conditioning for Indian metropolitan areas\n• ISHRAE (The Indian Culture of Heating, Refrigerating and Air Conditioning Engineers) – offers indoor environmental good quality standards and screening and ranking rules based on popular IEQ parameters specifications and requirements for the classification of properties based on vitality efficiency.\nWhilst HVAC design and style engineers should maintain applicable standards in thoughts and be certain that neighborhood codes are utilized in patterns, electrical power performance is a principal objective as perfectly. Ductwork design performs a major role in regulating indoor air top quality, thermal ease and comfort and ventilation. The essential function of ductwork structure is to provide the the very least obtrusive channel as a result of which interesting and warm air can journey in the most productive and expense-effective way.\nInaccurate duct styles could result in lousy indoor air excellent, warmth loss and not comfortable conditioned space in the creating. A effectively-made air conditioning HVAC method will in the end optimise fees. By regulating tension decline, choosing the correct duct measurement, balancing air strain and controlling acoustics, ductwork designers could optimise production, operational, environmental and commissioning fees.", "scores": {"score": 3, "score_transform_1": 5, "score_transform_2": 5, "score_transform_3": 0}}

{"id": "5495", "text": "Types of Shotgun Ammo\nShotguns have been around for centuries, and they remain one of the most versatile firearms on the market. One of the reasons for this is the wide variety of shotgun rounds that are available. Each type of round is designed to serve a specific purpose, and understanding the differences between them can help you choose the right ammunition for your needs.\nBirdshot is one of the most commonly used shotgun rounds. As the name suggests, it's primarily used for hunting birds, but is also suitable for small game and clay shooting. Birdshot is loaded with small pellets, typically ranging in size from #9 to #4. These pellets spread out as they leave the barrel, making it easier to hit fast-moving targets. Birdshot is also a good choice for home defense, as it's less likely to penetrate walls and harm innocent bystanders.\nBuckshot is a more powerful shotgun round designed for hunting large game, such as deer and bear. It's also a popular choice for home defense. Buckshot is loaded with larger pellets, typically ranging in size from 00 to 0000. These pellets don't spread out as much as birdshot, but they deliver a lot more stopping power. Buckshot is a good choice for situations where you need to take down a target with a single shot.\nUnlike birdshot and buckshot, which are loaded with multiple pellets, a slug is a single solid projectile. Slugs are commonly used for hunting large game, such as elk and moose, and also for self-defense. They offer excellent accuracy and stopping power, but they have a limited effective range compared to Birdshot or Buckshot. Slugs are also a good choice for situations where you need to penetrate barriers, such as car doors or thick walls.\nLess Lethal Rounds\nLess lethal rounds, also known as non-lethal or less-than-lethal rounds, are designed to incapacitate a target without causing serious injury or death. These rounds can be useful in situations where deadly force is not justified, such as riot control or crowd dispersal. Less lethal rounds include rubber bullets, bean bag rounds, and pepper spray rounds.\nIn addition to the standard types of shotgun rounds, there are also a number of specialty rounds available. These rounds are designed for specific purposes, such as breaching doors or extinguishing fires. Breaching rounds are used by law enforcement and military personnel to quickly and safely enter a building. These rounds are loaded with a slug or other projectile that's designed to penetrate a door or other barrier without causing too much damage to the surrounding area. Firefighting rounds are loaded with a special gel or powder that can extinguish fires by depriving them of oxygen.\nIn conclusion, shotguns offer a wide variety of ammunition options, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. Whether you're hunting, defending your home, or engaging in a tactical situation, it's important to choose the right type of ammunition for the task at hand.

Golds counterpart, silver, also gained about 1.4% to touch $15.13 and was moving even higher in the afternoon session.\nThe news on the U.S. economy continued to look mediocre to bad: U.S. productivity fell 2.2% in the fourth quarter; initial jobless claims rose by 6,000 to 278,000; the ISM services-sector index beat expectations but still fell; and factory orders rose 1.6% but missed forecasts of a 2% gain.\nDallas Federal Reserve chief Robert Kaplan sounded a note of caution on the economy, urging patience on enacting the next interest-rate hike and also warning that oil-related defaults could cause a negative ripple effect across the financial sector.\nWall Street on average is expecting the jobs number Friday to come in at about 190,000. A disastrous figure could send the yellow metal galloping toward $1,300.\nFormidable resistance at $1,550: Golds resurgence has sparked a slew of renewed bullishness and revised forecasts from some high-profile analysts and institutions. Famed Wall Street technician Louise Yamada, who has been bearish on gold for years now, published an optimistic note titled Gold breaks out.\nNoting the metals advance above its 200-day moving average, Yamada wrote, If gold retains strength over the days and weeks ahead, price could eventually overcome the sequential peaks at 1,300 (to lift also above the broken 2005 uptrend), as well as 1,350, 1,385 (to address the 2011 downtrend) and 1,440. Moving through these levels would bring price to a position of challenging the two-year formidable resistance at 1,550 (dashed horizontal line) over time. Gold may be able to achieve at least some of these targets over the weeks-to-months ahead.\nBank cites uncertainty in lifting target: And Germanys Commerzbank, which has been relatively bullish during 2016, just raised its price target by $50, setting a year-end price of $1,250.\nWe believe gold is well supported in the market environment of continued high uncertainty and negative interest rates, it wrote.\nAnd perhaps most notably, JPMorgan analyst Jan Loeys revealed the investment bank is now underweight (UW) stocks and is overweight (OW) gold.\nThe fundamentals of growth, earnings and recession risk have not improved, and if anything have worsened. We remain wary of the near-empty ammo box of policy makers, Loeys wrote.\nRecession odds now at 33%: Our 12-month-out U.S. recession odds have risen to 1/3, while equity-implied odds have instead fallen to near 1/5.But even with no recession this year or next, we see U.S. earnings rising only slowly by low single digits and see little to boost multiples. The eventual recession should bring U.S. stocks down some 30%, creating a strong downward risk skew to returns over the next few years.\nOur portfolio is now 5% UW Equities, the first UW this cycle. In Commodities, be short gas oil and base metals but OW gold.\nWith the jobs report out Friday, prepare for potential fireworks across the financial markets.

{"id": "5643", "text": "Underused Housing Tax Act Page restricted Underused Housing Tax Act October 31, 2023 – Underused Housing Tax filing deadline extended The Federal Government has announced a last-minute deadline extension for residential property owners who must file an annual Underused Housing Tax (UHT) Return for the 2022 tax year. The deadline has now been extended to April 30, 2024 for the 2022 tax year. The previously extended deadline was October 31, 2023. CHBA has been actively advocating for an industry exemption to this requirement and this deadline extension will provide more time to continue to seek that exemption. Earlier in 2023, through rigorous advocacy, CHBA was able to secure an administrative-reducing and cost-saving interpretation on the UHT. At that time, the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) also provided more time for affected builders/developers to file. While the deadline to file was still April 30, 2023, no penalties or interest would be applied to UHT returns and payments that the CRA received before November 1, 2023. That deadline has now been extended to April 30, 2024. Further information is contained on the CRA website. CHBA remains engaged with federal officials on trying to get an industry-wide exemption to having to file the UT-2900—this extension offers more opportunity to continue to seek it. March 28, 2023 - Update to Canada Revenue Agency filing deadline for the Underused Housing Tax Further to CHBA’s update below of March 20th below on the Underused Housing Tax (UHT), the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) has now provided an important update for the filing deadline for form UHT-2900. Acknowledging the challenges to those required to file an underused housing tax return, as communicated to the CRA by CHBA, the CRA is providing more time for affected owners to file. The application of penalties and interest under the Underused Housing Tax Act for the 2022 calendar year will be waived for any late-filed underused housing tax (UHT) return and for any late-paid UHT payable, provided the return is filed or the UHT is paid by October 31, 2023. While the deadline to file is still April 30, 2023, no penalties or interest will be applied for UHT returns and payments that CRA receives before November 1, 2023. Further information is contained on the CRA website. March 20, 2023 Update CHBA successful in getting administration-reducing/cost-saving interpretation on the Underused Housing Tax CHBA has been steadily working with government officials in the offices of the Minister of Finance and Minister of Revenue, as well as the Canada Revenue Agency, to find a solution to the unnecessary red tape caused by the new Underused Housing Tax (UHT) that is impacting the home building industry. CHBA is actively advocating for industry to be completely excluded from UHT tax filing, but in the meantime, has secured two very important interpretations, one providing clarity and one greatly reducing the level of effort to complete the UHT tax return. CHBA has secured clarification on what constitutes “substantially completed” as it pertains to the construction of a residential property, which was a key concern for members. Very importantly, CHBA has also successfully secured an interpretation to avoid requiring filing a taxable value (assessed or sale price, Lines 280 and 285 of UT-2900) of a property if the owner is exempt from paying any tax, which greatly minimizes the reporting burden. Letter from CRA to CHBA Re: Underused Housing Tax (March 10, 2023) No Requirement For Most Members to Complete Taxable Value Lines In the interpretation letter from CRA to CHBA, it states: “the CRA position is that a person is not required to report the amounts on Lines 280 and 285 of the UHT-2900 return with respect to the taxable value of the residential property in situations where both of the following conditions are met: No tax is payable in respect of the residential property for a calendar year due to the person’s ownership of the residential property being exempt from the UHT for the calendar year; and The person files the UHT-2900 return by December 31 of the following calendar year. For example, the return for the 2022 calendar year is filed by December 31, 2023.” [CHBA note: despite the confusing nature of this line, the deadline for filing is still April 30 – see below.] Therefore, for members that are exempt from paying the tax due to their ownership structure (e.g. Specified Canadian Corporations, Specified Canadian Partnerships, Specified Canadian Trusts), they are not required to report on Line 280 (assessed value) and Line 285 (sale price). For completing the forms electronically, CRA has confirmed that a value of ZERO (0) can be put in lines 280 and 285 by builders-developers who do not have a property assessment notice at the time of the UHT-2900 return filing date. The CRA will be publicly announcing this position shortly. Note that to be eligible to report zero for Lines 280 and 285, the return must be filed by December 31; however, penalties for late filing begin April 30, so members should still file by April 30, which, while still inappropriate red tape, will now be much less work. This interpretation secured by CHBA will dramatically reduce the level of effort for completing the returns, enabling members to simply enter the company information, the address of the unit, check their appropriate exemption box, and complete their election. While a return must still be filed for each unit (and CHBA continues to seek a complete exclusion for industry for this), this is a substantial win for the Association and its members, under the circumstances, in terms of time and cost savings for filing for this year. Clarity on Substantial Completion Regarding clarity on substantial completion, according to discussions with the Canada Revenue Agency, and confirmed via the CRA interpretation letter received by CHBA, the CRA considers a property to become a residential property for UHT purposes “when construction of the property is substantially completed (generally, 90% or more) so that an individual could reasonably inhabit the property.” CRA goes on to note that “a residential property may be considered to be substantially completed even if there are outstanding minor repairs, adjustments or upgrades, since this will not reasonably impair the use and enjoyment of the property as a place of residence. Whether the construction of a property is substantially completed on a particular day is a question of fact, and builders/owners of properties will have to make that determination on a case-by-case basis.” This is consistent with substantial completion interpretations for GST/HST filings. Furthermore, it is important to note that per CRA there is no obligation to file a return “for a property for a calendar year if the construction of the property is not substantially completed on December 31 of the calendar year.” CHBA Ongoing Advocacy for Full Exclusion The above should provide substantial relief for CHBA members. CHBA continues to advocate for a full exclusion for builders, renovators and developers from having to file the UHT-2900. However, a full exclusion will likely require a change to the legislation itself, which will take a longer period of time. In support of CHBA’s advocacy on seeking a full exclusion, members are still encouraged to contact their MPs about how builders, developers and renovators should be excluded from having to file UHT-2900 returns. February 5, 2023 The federal Underused Housing Tax (UHT) Act unfortunately can affect nearly all builder and developer members across the country. Hopefully you have already been contacted by your accountant about this issue, but in case you haven't, please note the following (and what CHBA is doing about it). While the Act states that newly built housing units are not subject to the Underused Housing Tax, all private corporations – therefore all builders and developers that are not publicly owned – are now required to file an Underused Housing Tax return (UT-2900) each year. This requires residential property owners (with some exceptions), including those with no foreign ownership, to file an annual UHT return for each housing unit owned on or after December 31, even where no tax is payable. Significant penalties apply if the UHT return is not filed by the deadline of April 30. CHBA is actively advocating against this situation, since builders and developers will now be encumbered with unnecessary red tape and accounting expenses to file tax returns for a tax that does not even need to be paid, since newly built housing units are exempt. For more details, CHBA Alliance Network partner MNP, one of Canada’s leading accounting, consulting, tax, and digital services firms, has a very thorough overview of the Underused Housing Tax Act. We encourage you to read it to find out if and how this applies to your company. Details on this tax have been slow to emerge, and many questions remain and clarifications are still needed. Indeed, the actual UT-2900 form only came out last week. Given the unacceptable situation this is placing our industry in, CHBA is asking that the federal government immediately implement an exemption so that builders and developers will not have to file a tax return for their newly constructed housing units for which they still possess title. It is unknown at this time if such an adjustment will be possible in time for this year’s filing deadline. Therefore unfortunately, and until further notice, members should proceed as if the UHT rules will proceed as they currently are published. Given that these filings are due April 30th (in reality, May 1st this year since April 30th is a Sunday) and the government is being very slow to react to the issue confronting our industry, you may wish to contact your local Member of Parliament to express your grave concern over this bureaucratic red tape that will cause work and expense for your company and for all of Canada’s corporations in home building and development - businesses that are working to add more housing supply, now burdened with red tape that will add unnecessary additional costs to housing. If your residence and your business are located in different ridings, we would also encourage you to contact the MPs for both. Please see here for contact information for your Member of Parliament. CHBA will continue advocating to get this administrative burden removed from our industry, and to update membership on progress made in seeking an exemption.", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}
{"id": "5648", "text": "Let’s talk about Noguchi — a conversation between Christie’s Michael Jefferson and Dakin Hart of The Noguchi Foundation\nWith the offer of 11 works by Noguchi at Christie’s in December 2020, our senior specialist in 20th-century design talks to the senior curator of The Isamu Noguchi Foundation and Garden Museum about light, physics, Futurism… and flat-packability\nIsamu Noguchi (1904-1988), Light Sculpture (Lunar), 1943. Magnesite, plastic, electric components and wood. 15¾ x 20¼ x 5⅛ in (40 x 51.4 x 13 cm). Estimate: $500,000-700,000. Offered in 20th Century: Hong Kong to New York on 2 December 2020 at Christie’s in New York\nMichael Jefferson: Light Sculpture (Lunar) is an abstraction, but one can interpret it as having anthropomorphic or zoomorphic attributes. Is it misguided to view parts of it as lobes, claws, forked appendages or even a red eye?\nDakin Hart: When it comes to swimming around in the vast tidal zone where figuration and abstraction intersect, nothing is misguided. Noguchi is good at providing enough specificity for ideas to attach to, but not so much that you can make one-to-one associations — solve the puzzle, as it were — and get bored.\nNot only does a good Noguchi never resolve, it usually continues to expand its associations. His sculptures love to get out and meet new ideas.\nMJ: The name ‘Lunar’ refers directly to the Moon. What is the significance of the Moon in Noguchi’s work in the 1940s?\nDH: The term ‘Lunar’ is an inflection as much as a direct reference to the Moon. He’s talking about distance; indirect illumination provided by something beyond and outside us, but almost knowable and within reach.\nIn a similar way, the addition of moonlight to paintings of shipwrecks, ruins, lovers and scenes from history helped to create what became known as Romanticism.\nMJ: Is there any relation between the contoured, Möbius-like surfaces of Light Sculpture (Lunar) and Noguchi’s thinking about folded space-time?\nDH: Absolutely. In the first half of the 20th century, modern physics performed much the same role for artists as art does for many of us now. It was a densely textured source of wonderment.\nWith Noguchi, it’s worth remembering that this was the birth of the golden age of science fiction. The term he took from John Cage — ‘imaginary landscape’ — is well applied to the Lunars. This one is an especially explicit cosmic microcosm.\nMJ: Noguchi’s light sculptures oscillate between reflected light (Lunars) and radiant light (Akari). The use of internal light was influenced by the lack of direct sunlight in urban areas to illuminate sculpture. Light is a significant aspect to his work at this time. Can you elaborate on that?\nDH: The interest in light was not at all new for him. A schematic cross-sectional drawing of his Musical Weathervane, a kind of Apple-like moon-shot of a product for the American Midwest from the late 1920s/early 1930s, shows how the Edison bulb would have fitted into the main body of this crazy thing, which also featured gills intended to produce music when the wind blew through them.\nAt the same time, Noguchi was working on various schemes for his Monument to Ben Franklin. In one sketch, the monument is linked to massive searchlights.\nIsamu Noguchi (1904-1988), Untitled (Double Bird), executed in 1958-1962. 14⅝ x 10 x 7⅛ in (37.1 x 25.4 x 18.1 cm). Offered in Post-War & Contemporary Art Day Sale, Featuring The Collection of Morton and Barbara Mandel on 3 December 2020 at Christie’s in New York\nA couple of years later, in the 1935 prospectus for a design business, Noguchi listed ‘lighting fixtures of metal and glass for direct and indirect lighting’ among the items the business was equipped to design, or to design and manufacture. ‘We also make illuminated weathervanes, emblems and sculptural displays,’ he wrote.\nOne of Noguchi’s defining characteristics as an artist — perhaps the most important — was understanding the entirety of American industry as an artistic/sculptural tool, industrial design as a way of approaching art, and technique as something to be found everywhere and used in any way, before pretty much anyone else.\nMJ: The Lunars have a compositional relationship to Surrealism and Biomorphism, but it seems these works are completely novel and independent in the history of art. Would you agree?\nDH: I don’t know about that. It isn’t that relevant for Noguchi. He’s always at best a sidebar, working the margins. That’s why he seems so central now, when the centre is finally getting what it has long had coming to it.\nNoguchi’s focus was always on continuity. Being well worn hasn’t made the sun stodgy. It seems as startlingly necessary today as I imagine it did more than 100,000 years ago, when our species emerged. Control of fire was the first epochal technology, in the way that it fundamentally changed our relationship with nature, starting the march that has led us to where we are now, glued to our cell phones.\nThe same thing goes for the lamp and candlelight, the first truly domesticated light sources. Despite the advent of electricity, they retain their power. In 1949 an art historian writing about the use of light in art pointed out that it wasn’t exactly new: ‘The idea of using light as an integral part of sculptured work is an old one — as old as the carved amethysts and carnelians of the classical era, the faces in semi-precious stone of Romanesque and Gothic reliquaries, or smaller sculptures of the High Renaissance which were hewn out of rock crystal.’\nMJ: The shape of the coloured fins in Light Sculpture (Lunar) have a direct relationship to the ‘Rudder’ tables and stools that Noguchi developed at the same time. Is there any significance to this form for Noguchi in the mid-1940s?\nDH: Mostly it’s about the dynamism of the shape. It’s the sculptural equivalent of all those swoops and parabolas in Futurist-inspired Italian posters from the 1930s and early aerospace logos. It’s the shape of progress, a vector meant to propel us into the future. For your breakfast nook. Or to hang on either side of the plastic credenza in your atomic-era aspirational dining room.\nIsamu Noguchi (1904-1988), rare ‘Rudder’ stool, model no. in-22, circa 1950. 16¾ in (42.5 cm) high; 14 in (35.5 cm) wide; 22 in (55.8 cm) deep. Sold for $30,000 in Design on 11 December 2020 at Christie’s in New York\nIt’s also worth noting that he used it everywhere, without regard to function or discipline. His interlocking sculptures, furniture and sets are also full of swooping half-crescents and proto-Nike swooshes.\nMJ: Can you elaborate on the significance of Noguchi’s time in the Poston relocation camp in Arizona as regards the spiritually charged work that emerges soon after, including the Lunars?\nDH: Wandering around the desert — cold, hungry and disillusioned — is a pretty classic spirit-quest trope. Just think about how dark the nights were there, literally and figuratively. How bright the moon. It definitely led him to do a lot of astral projecting.\nThis is the period in which his spaces of the mind really took shape. A lot, if not most, of his post-Poston works are spacey-cosmic: the Earth is seen from above, or is explicitly set in the heavens.\nMJ: Can you speak about the relationship between the origami-inspired works in cut and folded sheet metal, which date from the late 1950s, and Noguchi’s travels to Japan in that same decade?\nDH: That’s a great question. The essence of Noguchi is trans-categorical, meta-material conceptualism. Noguchi called his sculptures ‘visible ideas’. He was almost always working the same idea simultaneously through multiple means. The Herman Miller coffee table, his interlocking sculptures, the folded metal sculptures, his Akari lanterns — and even, nominally, the slab-formed ceramics — are all ‘knock-down’, collapsible.\nFlat-packability is part of Noguchi’s paradigm shift for sculpture, part of its movement into the modern age.\nMJ: Can you elaborate on Noguchi’s ideas regarding editions, and his view that they are each unique, like any other sculpture, as they occupy a specific space?\nDH: Noguchi used the term ‘multiple production’. He was never hung up on the specialness of his own touch. He was concerned with transmitting his ideas.\nOne of those was generating the kinds of objects and experiences that maintain their impact when widely shared. There are plenty of examples of this in most cultures. The oceans aren’t any less sublime because there are seven of them, and they touch all of the continents. The crucifix hasn't lost its punch because anyone can own one.\nPart of the method of Noguchi’s madness was to break down the traditional sculptural categories, each with its own standards governing how many copies of any given thing, made under prescribed circumstances, might be considered authentic. All of these norms are market-driven. Translated into categories of production, they are in fact the antithesis of art.\nMJ: Is it true that Noguchi conceived of his design works with the same rigour of form and material as he brought to his sculpture?\nDH: That’s a really tough question to answer. Like anyone who lived a long time, Noguchi changed his mind, shifted focus and emphasis, and at times contradicted himself.\nWhen asked to address this subject directly, he said just what you’re saying, that he approached everything he did with the same process. Which is fundamentally true. Because he loathed the prejudice that irrationally demeans table-making and equally irrationally sacralises art-making.\nChristie’s Online Magazine delivers our best features, videos, and auction news to your inbox every week\nHe does make a bit of a distinction, saying, with his usual flair, that when it comes to designing, the act of creating a form may be disciplined by the fundamental nature of the object desired. That would seem to differentiate industrial design from sculpture. On the other hand, he repeatedly described his ideal version of sculpture as an everyday tool.\nWhat I would say is that his concepts of art and design, usefulness and uselessness (both of which are valuable), like his notions of East and West, are continuous, intertwined, mutually encompassing and overlapping.\nMaybe the simplest way to put it is that, details aside, the Venn diagram of Noguchi’s view of his own work had only one circle.", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}
{"id": "5659", "text": "Professional Soft Washing is a gentle and effective method used to clean roofs and homes. It involves using a low-pressure water spray combined with specialized cleaning solutions to remove dirt, grime, algae, moss, and other stains from surfaces. The cleaning solutions used in soft washing are typically biodegradable and environmentally friendly. They are designed to break down and kill organic growth, without causing any damage to the surface being cleaned. The low-pressure water spray ensures that the cleaning process is gentle and does not cause any harm to the roof or home. Soft washing is a great alternative to pressure washing, which can be too harsh and potentially cause damage to delicate surfaces.\nPrior to the renovation of any exterior elements, you’ll want to pressure wash to save yourself a headache later on. It may seem like an unnecessary step, but if you read the labels on paint cans, sealant tubes, or bottles of stain, they’ll all tell you that a clean surface is necessary before application.\nPressure washing is a great way to not only make sure the surface is clean, but it also can take off old, peeling layers of product that could cause the new applications some problems down the line.\nProtect Your Home from Disrepair\nPrevent the growth of destructive mold, mildew, moss, and algae that can cause repair issues down the line. As you can see from this video, a pressure washer can easily erase mold that has grown onto the side of your home or business.\nSince pressure washing is such an easy solution, there’s no need for you to live with the damage and dinginess these kinds of growths can inflict on your house.\nDeep Clean All Areas of Your Home\nSiding, brick, and driveways aren’t the only areas that can benefit from a good power wash. Your patio or deck, any concrete surface, and even your outdoor furniture can profit from this spring cleaning task. You’ll think you have a brand new porch once the task is completed.\nImmediately Increase the Value of Your Home\nIf you’re planning to sell your home soon, pressure washing is an affordable and easy way to impress a potential buyer and boost your curb appeal. By removing that built up layer of dirt and grime with a simple pressure washing, you can drastically increase your home’s value to buyers and realtors.\nAccording to the National Association of Realtors, pressure washing can increase the sale price by $10,000 to $15,000.\nProtect You and Your Family’s Health\nIf you or your loved ones suffer from allergies or you want to make sure your home is as clean as possible, pressure washing can help alleviate many of those problems. By scraping off layers of dust, allergens, and mold, pressure washing gets rid of those irritants and cleans off surfaces so you can reclaim your home and your health.\nCall a Professional Soft Washing Company Today\nThough pressure washing looks like a simple task, there is more to it than meets the eye. Not only do you need to wear proper attire, but you also need to exercise great care: pressure washers are dangerous if not handled properly. If you’re curious about the other benefits of pressure washing, or if you need advice on how to pressure wash your house, contact your local pressure washing business for more information on the topic.

{"id": "5681", "text": "By Dayan Jayatilleka –\nIf (and only if) the ‘leaked’ draft of the US-UK resolution, scooped by the website Colombo Telegraph, is accurate, it represents both a trap and a last best chance for Sri Lanka. The purported draft does not call for an INTENATIONAL independent inquiry. It calls for an independent and credible inquiry. More accurately it calls upon the Government of Sri Lanka to institute such an inquiry. If the Government fails to do so, the draft resolution points to the 28th session as the moment when the international inquiry will be triggered.\nThus the Western draft resolution is very smart. It takes a step back in order to take two steps forward. It seeks to occupy the moral high ground, by holding the international inquiry in reserve for the moment while calling for an independent and credible inquiry.\nOne may speculate as to the reasons for the Western sidestep, but it amounts to a skilful manoeuvre; a flanking move. It is possible that the US-UK has recalibrated so as to bring the Geneva prong of their strategy more in line with a viable political endgame. The inclusion of an explicit reference to the 13th amendment and political reconciliation with the Northern Provincial Council and its Chief Minister may indicate India’s moderating hand behind the scenes, in exchange for the inclusion of references to devolution, or it could be the West’s attempt to secure Japan’s, India’s and South Africa’s support in the Council by adopting this more graduated escalatory approach rather than go in for a ‘Big Bang’ as the Diaspora and civil society activists called for. The references to issues of governance, human rights and coercion of religious and ethnic minorities also indicates an astute ‘thickening’ of the West’s resolution and therefore a broadening of its appeal internationally as well as within Sri Lanka, rather than a ‘ thin’ uni-dimensional, single issue focus of an international inquiry into war crimes allegations.\nThe draft resolution puts the ball squarely in the moral court of the Sri Lankan government. The threat to Sri Lanka does not reside so much in the text of the draft resolution itself but rather in the possible— or probable— ‘rejectionist’ response of the Sri Lankan government.\nIf the Sri Lankan government rejects the draft out of hand, it will fall into the trap set for this country. This draft, which holds back the term international, is capable of getting quite a few votes more than a resolution which would have called for an international inquiry. If the Sri Lankan government rejects this draft which seems reasonable and moderate, certainly on the face of it; if the Sri Lankan government representatives nit–pick and stonewall, then there will be far fewer votes for Sri Lanka than there would otherwise be.\nMany states occupying the middle ground, which might have had misgivings about an intrusive international inquiry, will have very little problem in voting for this draft.\nIf the Sri Lankan side rejects it frontally, then the margin of victory for the US-UK will be greater and the margin of defeat for the Sri Lankan side much wider, than it otherwise would have been.\nHow then should Sri Lanka respond? The draft takes the moral high ground. Sri Lanka must try at the least to share that moral high ground. The worst thing for Sri Lanka to do would be to relinquish the moral high ground by rejecting the draft in its totality and basing our argument on the concept of the ‘purely domestic’, ‘purely internal’ or ‘purely national’— a concept which has no place in the United Nations or in the global reality of the 21st century.\nIf one can win the majority of votes one need not negotiate with a text that is critical. However, Sri Lanka has placed itself in such a situation that victory is hardly likely. Thus it is prudent to engage, negotiate, and demonstrate flexibility.\nSri Lanka must try to draw this game by sharing the moral high ground which the Western draft resolution seeks to occupy and monopolize. This can be done by engaging with the text and attempting to influence it. This cannot be done by Sri Lanka alone and must not be attempted by Sri Lanka alone. It is always better to move as part of a broad front.\nThe current Sri Lankan regime’s notion of self sufficiency verges on isolationism. By stark contrast, even when Sri Lanka had accumulated an overwhelming preponderance of forces at the UN Human Rights Council in May 2009 at the special session, it chose at a certain point of the process, to shift gear, to move to the next level and to interface with the West not as a single sovereign state, but with the support of the Quartet, comprising the then Chairperson of the Non Aligned Movement ( Cuba) , the incoming Chairperson ( Egypt), and Sri Lanka’s two most important neighbours (India AND Pakistan). Thus the profile presented by our negotiating team was ‘Sri Lanka Plus’ — that is, Sri Lanka plus the Quartet.\nToday, in March 2014, we are on the defensive. We should engage with the UK-US draft text through the mediation of our friends in the Council, belonging to regional and cross regional groupings, such as the Non Aligned group, the Asian Group, the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) and the Group of Like Minded states.\nEngage means do not reject. It means converse constructively. It means struggle against the negative aspects but converge with the positive and strive for a synthesis. Working with the Office of the High Commissioner even to the extent of making it a minority shareholder as it were, is far better than having to accept an international inquiry the next time round, at the 28th session of the UNHRC. However, the relationship with the High Commissioner’s Office has to be negotiated. Here our friends in the UNHRC can help us hammer out a better equation than suggested in the US-UK draft resolution.\nLet me be brutally frank. A comparison of the UK-US draft resolution as has been leaked, and the official Sri Lankan government response to the Navi Pillay report, does not place Sri Lanka in a favourable position. The Sri Lankan response to Navi Pillay is one of stonewalling and simple denial on all counts. It also contains tendentious statements such that which alleges that the demonstrators at Weliweriya attempted to seize the weapons of the soldiers! The UK-US draft resolution, shorn of the call for an intrusive INTERNATIONAL inquiry, is much smarter; far better targeted. It is also not morally repugnant in any obvious sense.\nThe plain truth is that if the leaked draft is accurate, the international inquiry has been substituted by the call for a credible independent inquiry— which is a reiteration of the injunction of our own Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission (LLRC)—and the US-UK call at this point of time is for us to clean up our act. Sri Lanka would be a better place if the Government constructively engaged and cooperated with this call. That is quite distinct from either capitulation to an intrusive inquiry or entering a confrontation in which we shall demonstrate our growing international isolation by polling fewer votes in the Council or losing by a larger margin than we did twice before. The third time isn’t the charm.", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

{"id": "5702", "text": "Now that the hard work is over, the real hard work can begin. The transformation of Cranbrook’s venerable Armond Theatre into what will be a premier live music and performing-arts facility continues apace.\nIt has been just over a year since the historic downtown theatre, which sat empty and derelict for 20 years, was purchased by a partnership of three local entrepreneurs who set out to turn the 68-year-old building into a multi-purpose community arts centre. Casey Wright and Spencer Kerr (owners of Casey’s Roofing and Flashing), along with Ferdy Belland (local carpenter and musician), bought the building from Jean Trimble, who obtained the Armond in 2013 for similar purposes. The past year has been spent taking care of Phase Two of the operation (Phase One being the finalized purchase of the building), which involves the structural upgrades and hazardous materials abatement needed to bring the Armond Theatre up to modern public-occupancy requirements. With the abatement mostly complete, Armond co-owner Ferdy Belland is now able to offer a (masked and socially distanced) tour to a curious member of the media.\nThe lobby will feature a saloon-style bar where the concession stand once was. Washrooms remain located on either side of the entrance to the ballroom. The idiosyncrasies of the theatre design (a gradual upward slope to the stagefront) meant the ballroom’s main floor is raised a foot above the floor of the lobby. The current plywood subfloor (installed by previous owners) will be replaced by an engineer-approved hardwood dance floor. Side tables will be attached to the walls of the 1600 square foot space, with sound baffles mounted across the high walls to reduce unwanted echo. Belland says the entire renovation project is taking inspiration from the original Art Deco style of the original interior.\n“The finished results won’t be an exact carbon-copy of what you see in the old photographs from the 1950s,” says Belland, “but we’re paying attention to fine detail with this, and the new Armond Theatre will have a style and beauty all its own.”\nTen feet above the main floor of the ballroom is the upper mezzanine balcony, an immense space unto itself, another 1400 square feet. Another larger ornate bar is planned for installation along the back wall of the balcony space, which will be used for fixed-table seating and potential standalone lobby events. The sides of the upper-level project out some distance along the wall over the ballroom floor. These will be converted into opera-style box-seats and give the upper-level balcony an extensive horseshoe shape.\n“The structural engineers will tell us if our wild dreams can actually be built,” Belland quips. “In the meantime, we’ll keep dreaming. We need to be prepared in case Waldorf and Statler from the Muppet Show decide to attend an event.”\nAltogether, the renovations will allow for a comfortable variable capacity of 200-400 people in the public spaces. The warren of rooms behind the balcony, where the projection booth used to be, will be used for office space and custodial storage. These rooms include the fireproof vault where the flammable celluloid film reels were safely kept.\nThe stage itself, formed from thick bunker-style concrete (like the entire building itself), is a respectable 40 feet wide and 16 feet deep, once the remaining cinema-screen framing is removed. Doors located high on the stage’s sidewalls have been present since the original construction, when the stage was also used for theatrical productions, beauty pageants, and public speaking events, aside from the Armond’s traditional cinematic programming.\nThe Armond Theatre is one of the few buildings in the Downtown Core wired for 400-amp service — plenty of power for whoever or whatever takes the stage. The interior design will incorporate dedicated acoustic engineering and will feature a state-of-the-art surround-sound and lighting system.\nIn the basement below the stage is the mechanical room, dominated dramatically by a huge vintage cast-iron boiler. Once the boiler is safely abated and removed (Belland and his partners plan to mount the locomotive-like face of the boiler in the lobby as funky heritage ornamentation), the leftover space will be converted to a Green Room for performers. Stairs will give quick access to the stage — there will be none of this satirical Spinal Tap business of getting lost trying to get to the stage from backstage.\nBut now it’s time for Phase Three planning of the Armond’s rejuvenation — the renovations and installations, including the floors, office spaces, lobby, the unique louvered ceiling from the cinema era (which will be kept intact), and the restored interior aesthetic, which Belland says will embrace Retro-Chic stylings: the coffered ceilings, the wooden wainscoting, the hardwood dance floor, the wall sconces, the velvet drapery, the gilded balcony area, among other exciting decorations.\nPhase Four will be the actual opening of the Armond Theatre to the public, which is still some distance away. “That’s when the REAL work begins,” says Belland. “But with all the enthusiasm and excitement we’ve been receiving so far from the Cranbrook community, we’re more than confident that our endeavours will be well-supported.”\nAll things being equal, including the current pandemic restrictions and their eventual easing, Belland hopefully anticipates a tentative opening of early Summer 2022. Belland said a reborn Armond Theatre will help kick-start Cranbrook’s downtown nightlife back into high gear, with ripple effects benefitting established downtown businesses - hospitality, retail, and accommodations-wise. And once the pandemic is over, the desire for live music and mass public gatherings for entertainment, arts and culture will come roaring back exponentially.\n“The Armond Theatre will assist in the ongoing efforts of the City of Cranbrook and the Downtown Business Association with downtown revitalization, heritage infrastructure restoration, tourism economy and civic pride,” he said. “Cranbrook will be exploding throughout the 2020s, and for the better — culturally and economically. We wish the Armond Theatre to be part of this positive upsurge.”", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

Older boomers listened to Bill Haley, slightly younger ones liked Frankie Avalon, their younger siblings were into either the Beach Boys or British Invasion.\nBut sheep flock, and, just as hordes of kids ran off to San Francisco in the late 60s, hordes of current kids will happily find their identity in whatever the marketers tell them is hip.\nAddressing Stahler’s content, I will once more express my regret that so many kids have found themselves confined by the pandemic, though I suppose that, just as a generation of Americans grew up in the Depression and a generation of British kids grew up in the Blitz, they’ll figure things out.\nThough I hope it’s not by absorbing the advice of Gary Varvel (Creators) and allowing a minority of militant anarchists to seek through extortion what they cannot win at the ballot box.\nI didn’t know that anybody picked a fight with truckers, but I do know that the vast majority, not just of Canadians but of Canadian truckers, are thrilled to see the Freedom Convoy coming to a halt, despite the bleating of authoritarians from our side of the border.\nUnfortunately, the phenomenon has spread beyond Canada, and Rod Emmerson expresses the feelings of New Zealanders, whose nation seemed to have a grip on things until the screwballs and nutjobs there were inspired by the experience of lunatics in the US and Canada.\nThe important thing is not whether they are right or wrong. Of course they’re wrong, unless you are hoping for a Fourth Reich and an end to democracy.\nThe problem, rather, is that, while one side is giggling over Marjorie Taylor Greene’s “gazpacho” gaffe, she remains the top fundraiser in the GOP and one of their most powerful members.\nThey like her, and I’d suggest that, while mocking people and calling them stupid can be cathartic, it rarely lures anybody over to your side of the aisle.\nPeople who want to get the fascisti out of power are going to have to take a different approach.\nThough I’ll admit I do love me a good catharsis, and Tom Tomorrow certainly serves this up with gusto and precision.\nAs I said earlier of Other Tom’s work, the multi-panel format offers cartoonists an opportunity to drive home their points rather than just make a less complex one-panel observation.\nThis cartoon may be more cathartic than persuasive — particularly since few rightwingers will even see it — but there is true value in keeping your troops aroused and motivated as the midterm elections approach.\nThe people of Athens, Tennessee, turned out to oppose their school board’s removal of Maus from the curriculum, and got nowhere, but my guess is that they will be back for the next school board election.\nI’ll take it.\nCan’t We Talk About Something More Pleasant?\nI don’t know if this counts as “more pleasant,” but, in this week’s Zits (KFS) story arc about Pierce wearing a kilt, we learned a couple of things we hadn’t known before.\n- Pierce has a very large penis.\n- Sarah has enough experience of penises to judge relative sizes.\nI’m old enough to remember when you couldn’t make fart jokes in the paper.\nCivilization marches on!\nMeanwhile, over in Between Friends (KFS), Maeve persuaded her BF not to join her in Paris for a conference, which gives her the freedom to once more completely screw up her love life.\n“Once more” is critical here, because just as Dagwood consistently ends up dangling from his gutters, Maeve consistently screws up her love life.\nThe difference is that we know Dagwood will survive and be back tomorrow good as new. He’s like Wiley Coyote in that he not only survives disaster but shows no bruises or scars.\nMaeve is more finely depicted, such that her repeated misadventures do take a toll. We feel no suspense when Dagwood is hanging from his gutters again, but each time Maeve messes things up, it’s like having a real-life friend who just can’t freaking get her act together.\nIt’s a different generation of comic strips, similar to when TV shows like Dallas and Falcon Crest added continuity to what had, previously, been one-off story lines.\nAnd, yes, I want to see how she screws things up this time, and how many bruises and scars she accumulates in the process.\nIt could be worse.

A growing trend towards eco-tourism puts Stockholm on the map, while Istanbul is expected to be one of the most visited European destinations in recognition of its recent title of ‘European City Of Culture’.\nRichard Tams, British Airways head of UK & Ireland sales, said: “Customers recognise that there’s a world of opportunity out there – from tiger safari in India, to the FIFA World Cup in South Africa and the bright lights of Las Vegas.\n“In 2010, holidaymakers will have more choice of beach destinations than ever, especially with our new services to Punta Cana, Sharm El Sheik and the Maldives.”\nThe top 10 list for 2010 includes the following destinations:\n1. Cape Town, South Africa\nNearly half a million supporters are expected to visit South Africa during the FIFA World Cup in June. With Cape Town home to stunning beaches, mountains, vineyards and the Cape Town Stadium, it’s sure to be a popular base for fans.\nSue Botes, British Airways’ commercial manager in South Africa, says: “Cape Town has always been a popular destination, we expect the World Cup to push it to the top of the longhaul league table as the best place to be in 2010. We are already preparing for the event and have additional flights in place, as well as our local carrier Comair to connect fans to destinations around the republic.”\n2. Istanbul, Turkey\nAs European Capital of Culture for 2010, Istanbul is Europe’s hotspot in the New Year. Offering great value for money and something for everyone – from beaches and bazaars to the breathtaking Bosphorus. Secret music gigs, rooftop bars and underground clubs dominate the social scene for the party-hard locals.\n3. Las Vegas, USA\nThe film ‘The Hangover’ has rekindled our love affair with the entertainment capital of the world. Not just a haven for partying – Las Vegas is firmly established as a family friendly destination with everyone from U2 to Cirque de Soleil performing on the famous strip.\n4. Vancouver, Canada\nAlready a must-go destination for skiing and snowboarding, it’s no surprise that Canada will play host to the 2010 Vancouver Winter Olympic and Paralympic Games in February and March.\nBritish Airways athlete Zoe Gillings is the UK’s number one snowboarder and hopes to compete in the 2010 Vancouver Winter Olympic Games. Zoe said: “Vancouver is one of best all-year round destinations for snowboarding and Cypress Mountain in West Vancouver is one of my favourite spots to train.”\n5. Punta Cana, Dominican Republic\nPunta Cana is one of the emerging destinations for holidaymakers in the New Year, with top tour operators citing local beaches as ‘the most stunning in the Caribbean’. Known for its golf and spa facilities, the island is one of the best-kept property secrets in recent times. Boasting a five-mile oceanfront, local hangout Cap Cana is rumored to be the new playground for the rich and famous.\n6. Dubrovnik, Croatia\nKnown as the ‘Pearl of the Adriatic’, Croatia offers privacy and tranquility making it a popular hideout for the jet set, including recent visitors Jay-Z and Beyonce.\nMirjana Dostal, British Airways commercial manager Croatia, said: “Dubrovnik holds many attractions and delightful boutiques, with each corner of the city offering a unique experience. However its cluster of private islands have made this a new favourite destination for Hollywood A-Listers to get-away.”\n7. New York, USA\nNew York has always been hip, but the New Year will give us yet more excuses to plan a trip. Due for theatrical release in 2010 are two film sequels celebrating Manhattan – ‘Sex and the City 2’ and Oliver Stone’s ‘Wall Street 2’…. apt timing for BA’s new 32-seat business-class only service from London City Airport to New York.\n8. Stockholm, Sweden\nRecently voted the best city in the world to live in, Stockholm has become the model city for others to follow. Europe’s epicenter of biodiversity and ecology will celebrate its official title of ‘European Green Capital’ in 2010, making it a popular choice for eco-tourists.\n9. The Maldives\nSet in the Indian Ocean, this tropical paradise will be one of the hottest destinations for holidaymakers and honeymooners in 2010. Collections of coral reefs boast unrivalled facilities for diving, while the picture postcard beaches offer chill-out bliss to the maximum.\n10. Delhi, India\nThanks to the growing trend for ‘tiger safari’, nearby destinations Bandhavgarh Wildlife Sanctuary and Kanha National Park provide another reason to get off the beaten track and visit Delhi in 2010.\nJudy Jarvis, British Airways regional commercial manager South Asia said: “There has never been a better time to visit India. Next year marks two special occasions – 80 years of British Airways flying to India and the first time Delhi will host the Commonwealth Games. With 45 weekly flights to five destinations, we offer an unrivalled service.”", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}
{"id": "5823", "text": "As a financial professional, it is crucial to be well-prepared to answer questions from your board of directors. Being able to articulate complex financial concepts and provide clear, concise explanations can help build trust and credibility with your board, which is essential for the success of your organization. In this article, we will explore some of the most common financial questions your board of directors may ask and provide tips on how to best answer them.\nFinancial insights are the foundation of a healthy, strategic partnership with the CEO, board, and other key decision-makers. So, too, is understanding data assessments and projections in order to glean important information to share with leadership. Knowing what and how to share financial information can be particularly tricky when answering to a board of directors or outside influencers, who may not be privy to industry or strategic details.\nSo what should you be prepared to address when meeting with your board? We've gathered key questions leaders will likely face at one point or another.\nWhat can you tell me today about our financial health tomorrow?\nWhen leadership is questioned about cash and sources of funds, they are asked to share a sense of company spending and to make projections about both near- and long-term growth. Knowing where the company’s cash is—and analyzing both best and worst-case scenarios—is essential in painting an accurate financial picture of the company.\nFinance teams can help provide the visibility required to keep the board abreast of historic transactions, real-time issues, and future possibilities, so they have confidence in what's ahead.\nWhile a board is likely concerned with having sufficient funds to handle payroll or other overhead expenses, what they really want to know is if now is the right time to make an investment in resources. If you haven't established key performance indicators (KPIs) for your business, now is the time to do so. It's also time to have a clear system for measuring and monitoring them. Financials are important, clearly, but KPIs can help inform decisions.\nThere will also inevitably be a time when the answer to the question of the financial health of a business is not a positive one. Maintaining a transparent and honest relationship with the board is critical. Moreover, this news always needs to come up with a data-driven strategy to improve the situation.\nHow are we hitting company goals?\nDeveloping and maintaining an organization's mission, values, and growth strategy is a key part of any executive's role, and every board of directors wants to know exactly how the team is working to achieve this. This conversation isn’t just asking you where the company is in relation to set goals, but instead, how the company got where they are, what comes next, and what changes need to be made. This is where accurate financial reports, up-to-date data, and CFO insights come into play.\nIf the CEO or CFO cannot come equipped to the meeting with this data, it’s time to upgrade your financial management resources (and that may mean looking outside the organization). Change occurs quickly in any business, and it’s up to finance and accounting to know why these changes are happening. Goal tracking is a huge part of a CFO’s job, but analysis of movement on said goals is what moves an organization forward, and what elevates the finance team's role within the leadership team. This question on goals will likely serve as the foundation for conversation, so coming in with a full picture, and an accurate answer can set a positive tone for the rest of the meeting.\nWhat strategies are in place to manage risk?\nBusiness is unpredictable—markets change, technologies emerge, competitors enter and exit the marketplace—and leaders need to prepare for all unknowns. Board members, executive leadership, and stakeholders know that there are strategic advantages to taking risks and that realizing growth requires some degree of risk. It is a delicate balancing act that requires accurate data, flexibility, and oversight.\nThis oversight has increasingly become the responsibility of the board. A good board will ask tough questions regarding policies and procedures around risks, along with the organization's strategies and risk appetite. So, come prepared.\nThe scope of what is required varies by industry but may include a risk and recovery plan, competitive intelligence, merger and acquisition (M&A) targeting, remediation options in case of downturns, and value-added contribution strategies to sustain a competitive advantage or improve performance. This will allow for deeper conversations, and yes, deeper questions into the company's health. For example:\n- What are the company’s top risks, what is their estimated impact and how likely are they to occur?\n- Does the company truly understand the key assumptions underlying its strategy?\n- How often are top risks assessed?\n- Who owns the top risks and is accountable for results, and to whom do they report?\n- How effective is the company in managing its top risks?\n- Are there any “blind spots” within the organization that need addressing?\nThis dialogue should continue throughout the lifespan of a company. The board should engage in periodic discussions about the risks the company should take, those it should avoid, and the parameters it should operate within.\nWhat does the capital structure look like in five years?\nAn organization’s capital structure reflects the way it’s capitalized. In other words: how has money been supplied to fund the business and to help it grow? A healthy capital structure that reflects a low level of debt and a high amount of equity is a positive sign of investment quality. A board and outside investors will want to know whether a business has enough capital structure to achieve its vision. If not, what is the plan to get there?\nIn other words, will it take in outside investors, additional debt, or other strategies? Or are estimated business earnings enough to hit cash flow targets? A savvy finance manager or CFO can do the heavy lifting by modeling earnings, cash flows, capital expenditures, and more. Projections can model different timeframes and market impacts.", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

{"id": "5827", "text": "NEW YORK (June 18, 2014 – CNNMoney) — The federal government is shelling out $264 a month, on average, for people who qualify for premium subsidies on the Obamacare federal exchange.\nThat leaves the subsidy-eligible with an average bill of $82 a month for health insurance after the hefty credits, according to a report issued Wednesday by the Department of Health and Human Services.\nSome 87% of the 5.4 million people who signed up through healthcare.gov, which handled enrollment for 36 states, qualified for subsidies. The department is still gathering data for the 14 states and District of Columbia that ran their own exchanges, which attracted roughly another 2.6 million sign-ups.\nObamacare came under criticism from some shoppers on the exchange after they found the premiums to be rather pricey. Those who don’t qualify for subsidies — and even some who do — may find themselves paying hundreds of dollars a month for coverage.\nThis has prompted the administration to tout the share of people who qualify for the premium credits, as well as the size of the average subsidy.\nSenior HHS officials declined to estimate the total cost of the subsidies for 2014, but the Congressional Budget Office projected it would be $12 billion.\nAnyone earning up to 400% of the poverty line — up to $45,960 for an individual and $94,200 for a family of four — was eligible for a subsidy. The subsidies were pegged to the cost of the second-cheapest silver plan in one’s area. People could choose from four coverage tiers ranging from the cheapest, bronze, to the most expensive, platinum.\nThe lower one’s income, the larger the credit. Someone earning $17,235 a year paid no more than $57 a month for that silver plan, while those with incomes of $40,215 forked over no more than $318 after subsidies.\nThose signing up could pick the cheapest silver plan or a less expensive bronze plan and pay an even lower monthly premium. Some 46% of those eligible for subsidies are paying less than $50 a month, and 69% are paying less than $100, the report found. In some cases, the plan may cost nothing.\nConsumer advocates have said that increasing awareness of the subsidies is key to boosting enrollment. Many of the uninsured have said they aren’t signing up because they perceive the coverage to be too costly.\nThe report also looked at the competition among plans in the exchange. Shoppers had five insurers and 47 policies to choose from, on average. The more insurers, the lower the premiums, officials said.", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}

Unfortunately, I didn't have any avocados. So the next time I was grocery shopping, I grabbed some. I kept them out to ripen. Then, again, my son said \"Mom, you should make yourself avocado toast for breakfast\".\nI had forgotten that the avocados were probably ripe by now, I checked and there was at least one ripe avocado, so I planned to make avocado toast the next day for breakfast.\nThis morning, I finally made myself avocado toast consisting of a slice of toast, roasted red pepper spread, egg, and yes, nicely ripened fresh avocado! I sat down with my son for breakfast. He noticed right away that I was eating my avocado toast. He was glad that I finally made it for myself. When I told him how good it was and what I had included on it, he was delighted. He said \"See, I told you you should make yourself avocado toast!\" to which I replied, \"Yes, thank you for encouraging me to make it, it is so yummy\".

It was a nudge towards self-care, towards self-nourishment, and towards doing something for myself that I enjoyed, even if it didn't serve anyone else but me.\nUnfortunately, most of the time, we don't have anyone nudging and reminding us to take care of ourselves, to take time for self-care, especially not from our kids! When I think of the number of times my son reminded me to make myself avocado toast, it was at least 3 times, if not more, over about a month. To be honest, without his encouragement, I likely wouldn't have made avocado toast for a very long time, simply because it takes a bit of extra effort.\nThe satisfaction on my son's face after we had breakfast together, with my avocado toast, was priceless. At that moment I realized that by taking the time to nourish myself and take care of myself by eating what I enjoyed, I showed him that I believed I was worth the effort of avocado toast (or however I choose to take care of myself), and this gives him permission to do the things he enjoys and express his needs and wants as well.\nSelf-care is often seen as selfish, especially for moms. However, from a piece of avocado toast, it was reinforced to me that my son is watching and my taking the time to care for myself, teaches him that not only am I worth caring for myself, but so is he. As my son grows up, instead of modeling hustle and working at all costs, I want to model tuning into myself and making time to take care of my needs.\nIf my story speaks to you, I highly encourage you to get my DIY Self-Care Guide for Moms. You can grab it here. You are worth investing in, and this guide will walk you through creating a plan that works for you and your family.\nRemember Mama, you are Worthy, Valued, and greatly Loved.\nBN BSc MBEC", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

The program receives applications, with stories like the one below, for assistance regarding situations including homelessness, food insecurity, job loss, health crisis, loss of loved ones, and most recently, COVID-19 relief.\nMy name is Marcus and I have been struggling for some time now. Before losing my car at the end of December, I was sleeping in my car and working a part time job that didnt give me enough hours to work to pay my car note and insurance, let alone to buy soups, canned foods, bread, and peanut butter. After losing my car I started going to Labor Finders and Craigslist looking for work to make some extra income, and my mother sent me what little she could to help me get my car back. After I got it back, I started sleeping in my car again instead of wherever I could find a place a park or a friends couch for the night. Sometimes it seems no matter how hard I try it is never enough. By the time I get some money, I have to try to pay past due car payments, which has to be my priority because I sleep in my car and it is all I have. That is one reason why I am going to school to be an RN and will do so no matter how hard it will be or how long it will take. I would like nothing more than to get a place of my own. If I had a place of my own instead of my car, I could sleep better. Living out of my car is hard. I get woken up by cars playing loud music, garbage trucks, and people cutting grass and hedges. Summer is so hot, and winter is so cold. Finding a restroom is difficult. I would be a better student and better worker if I just had a place. I hate asking for anything, but if there is any help out there, I could really use it. This has been the roughest time of my life, but I never lose hope. Im grateful for the experience because it has taught me a lot.\nStories like Marcuss are too common, but the WGTC Foundation will use this grant to make a difference for many students, Vice President of Student Affairs Tonya Whitlock said.\nIve had the opportunity to work closely with the WGTC Foundation for years on Project CARE, and I can tell you from firsthand experience how important this funding is to our students not just in times of worldwide crisis like now with COVID-19, but year round as our students work to better their own lives and the lives of their families, Whitlock said. Im so grateful that the Tides Foundation saw this and felt compelled to support this effort with their generous gift.\nIn previous years, the application period would be made available only two times per year, with assistance being awarded to roughly 50 people per year. The Tides grant will greatly supplement the Project CARE operating budget, allowing the WGTC Foundation to open the application more often and help so many more people.\nThe WGTC Foundation is so proud to be the beneficiaries of Tides Foundations generosity, Executive Director of Institutional Advancement Kelsey Jones said. At the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, our Foundation began to actively fundraise for more support for Project CARE and we personally committed a 40 percent budgetary increase to the program. Even at that, we had to turn away dozens of worthy applications for assistance. With the help of this grant, we are going to be able to support more students for quite some time, and we could not be more grateful.\nTides envisions a world of shared prosperity and social justice founded on equality and human rights, sustainable environment, quality education and healthy individuals and communities.

{"id": "5948", "text": "Zirconia Dental Crowns in Bentonville\nIntegrated Dentistry provides zirconia crowns to patients in Bentonville, AR. Contact our office to learn more or schedule an appointment!\nDental crowns have a number of functions in dentistry, including replacing teeth when paired with dental implants, supporting dental bridges, restoring a tooth with deep decay, and protecting a tooth following a root canal. No matter the reason for your dental crown, zirconia is an excellent option.\nThe Zirconia Difference\nZirconia crowns represent the cutting edge of restorative dentistry and we’re pleased to be able to offer them to our patients. These crowns are made from zirconium dioxide; although scientifically speaking, this material is a metal, it looks like a tooth-colored ceramic crown. Here’s why you might wish to choose a zirconia crown:\nThese crowns pair the aesthetics of ceramic with the strength of metal, making them an excellent option for replacing molars, which need to withstand the daily wear-and-tear of eating.\nZirconia crowns come in two varieties: solid and layered. A solid zirconia crown has superior strength, making it ideal for restoring molars. That said, while solid zirconia looks natural, it doesn't have quite the same translucence or luster as a real tooth. That’s where layered zirconia crowns come in—they are painstakingly made to mimic the appearance of natural teeth, so they can be used to restore teeth that are visible when you smile and blend in seamlessly.\nZirconia dental crowns have a similar lifespan to metal and gold alloy crowns, which are considered the strongest types of crowns available. If you’re looking for a crown that might never need to be replaced, zirconia is ideal.\nZirconia is related to titanium, and like titanium, it is a biocompatible material that doesn’t cause inflammation and other reactions from the body.\nWhen you visit our office for a consultation, we’ll go over your dental crown options and help you decide whether a zirconia crown is right for you.\nFrequently Asked Questions About Zirconia Dental Crowns\nAre zirconia crowns good for front teeth?\nLayered zirconia crowns have a translucence and opalescence that makes them a great choice for restoring front teeth. Like porcelain crowns, they are made with thin layers of material to mimic the layers of dentin and enamel that make up a natural tooth.\nHow long do zirconia crowns last?\nZirconia crowns last for decades, and with proper care, they can even last a lifetime.\nHow much does a zirconia crown cost?\nThe cost of a zirconia crown depends on the tooth being restored and your insurance coverage. We can provide you with an estimate when you visit our office for your consultation.\nDo zirconia crowns stain?\nOne of the advantages of zirconia crowns is that the material is resistant to stains.\nDoes insurance cover zirconia crowns?\nYes, dental insurance plans usually cover zirconia crowns, assuming you’re not getting a crown solely for cosmetic reasons. Because dental insurance plans vary from one provider to the next, we encourage you to contact your insurance company to verify your benefits. Our team is also happy to help you understand your coverage.\nCall 479-333-1300 to schedule an appointment with a dentist in Bentonville, AR today!", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}

These are available on machines less than 10 years old that are covered by a new or renewed CVA.\nParts availability: Cat guarantees maintenance and common repair parts will be available to CVA customers when they need them. If a maintenance part is not available by the end of the next business day or Cat can’t get it to you Cat will credit you up to $1,000 for the amount of the unavailable parts. For common repair parts on dealer-performed service, the $1,000 credit applies at the end of the second business day.\nService response time: This ensures that you will have priority appointment scheduling, getting the next available slot in the dealer’s shop. Diagnostics are run before the machine comes in or the technician arrives, and the customer receives progress updates as their machine is serviced.\n“Customers continue to choose CVAs in record numbers,” says Marcy Bytner, Cat marketing consultant. “In fact, 60% of our construction industry machines are sold with CVA, and 45% of those customers choose to renew.”\nCaterpillarManaging most of your own repairs? Cat’s new Self-Service Options (SSO) offering is aimed at you.\n“Typically a customer has to do all the research on a repair and sometimes guess as to what parts are needed,” says Mike Hernandez, Cat program manager. “SSOs take out the guesswork and make the repair process easier and more convenient.”\nWorking at your direction on what repair you want to make, Cat will put together an SSO package that includes the parts, instructions and recommended tooling to complete the specific work on more than 300 models. Repairs covered include minor engine bolt-ons, service brakes for drivetrains, replacing batteries and alternators, hydraulics and implement controls. The service instructions are available in 10 different languages.\n“This is not a traditional kit, which is typically a fixed quantity of parts in box sitting on the shelf,” Hernandez says. Instead, each SSO can be customized to include only the parts and tooling you need to complete the repair by yourself. Customers can then complete the repair in-house and on their own schedule.\nSSOs can be ordered online at Cat’s parts store or by contacting your local Cat dealer. The dealer fills the order, and if questions arise during the repair, your service tech can receive additional support from the dealer. “Customers are not alone in the repair journey,” Hernandez says.\nCat is concentrating on its small and compact equipment first with this program. Machines include compact track loaders, skid steers, compact wheel loaders, backhoes, compact excavators, small wheel loaders and dozers and telehandlers. As new machines are introduced, new Cat SSO packages will be developed.\nDid you miss our previous article…", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

{"id": "6021", "text": "Are Prenups Only for the Wealthy? Definitely Not.\nWhen you hear about celebrities, athletes, and other wealthy individuals getting married, you often hear the term prenuptial agreement mentioned. It may very well make you question “are prenups only for the wealthy?”\nA prenuptial agreement is a written contract between two people entering a marriage that sets forth each parties’ rights and obligations, protects the parties’ properties and assets, and provides how these assets will be distributed in the event of death or divorce. Since the wealthy have more assets, many people mistakenly believe that only the rich choose to get prenuptial agreements, so they don’t even consider them when they are getting married. Others feel that prenups are in poor taste and could put a sour taste on the upcoming marriage.\nHowever, neither of these statements is true. In fact, anyone who is planning to get married, no matter how numerous or few their assets may be, should make sure to have an agreement in place. Getting a prenup to protect yourself is one of the best decisions you’ll ever make!\nWhat Do Prenups Cover?\nNaturally, the agreement will cover the finances of each individual. This is generally what comes to mind when thinking about prenuptial agreements. However, these contracts can cover a lot more, such as property division, assets acquired before and during the marriage, tax status, debts before marriage, and debts during the marriage.\nWhat Are the Benefits of Having a Prenuptial Agreement?\nWe all do it, hope for the best, but we should always plan for the unexpected. No one likes the idea of getting a divorce, and it is the furthest thing from your mind when you are getting married. However, the reality is that many marriages simply do not work out for a myriad of reasons. The prenuptial agreement ensures that you don’t have to worry about losing everything in the event of a divorce. You will understand the difference between marital and non-marital property, and you can protect your estate.\nIn addition, since there is a contract that spells out what will happen in the event of a divorce, it could reduce the conflicts and time spent arguing during the divorce proceedings. This can actually help you to save time and money and have a smoother transition in the event of divorce.\nHow to Get a Prenup\nNow that you can see the benefits of getting a prenuptial agreement, it’s time that you and your future spouse sit down and discuss it. This can be a very touchy subject to bring up, as it is not very romantic. However, it is important, and it is not something that you want to put off for long. Be honest, open, and explain the benefits that it can bring to both of you. At that point, you will be able to contact an attorney who can draw up the agreement for you. You should speak to an attorney well in advance of your set wedding date, you need to give yourself time to think about the decisions, review and discuss the document so that you are not rushing the process and adding stress to your big day. Never choose a piece of do-it-yourself software for this agreement. Make sure that you have an attorney handle the process for you to guarantee legality, and to ensure that your contract will hold up in court.\nWhen you are selecting an attorney for your prenup, choose someone who has knowledge of family law, and who can help you and your future spouse understand how the prenuptial agreement can help you. The attorney will explain the additional benefits of having a prenuptial agreement drafted.\nEven if you don’t have the wealth of an A-list actor or a starting quarterback, it does not mean that you should go into a marriage without a prenuptial agreement. No matter the value of your assets, it is important to have some protection. In the event of a divorce, a prenuptial agreement will ensure that you can get on with your life without fear of becoming destitute in the process. At Lauriston Law Firm, our client’s best interests are our top priority – always. We will make sure you understand the process and answer any questions you or your fiancé may have about prenuptial agreements. This process is fast, easy, and will be a convenient way to start your new life next to your loved one.

{"id": "6061", "text": "Sometimes you plan to use more bread, but don’t spend it all. Before deciding to save it for later use, you should check does bread go bad and how long does bread last. In most cases, it has a short shelf life because the starches that it contains start degrading fast. Let’s see how long you can keep and use it safely.\nTable of Contents\nDoes Bread Go Bad?\nThe answer to this question is simple but not entirely satisfying for this delicious flour product’s fans. Yes, bread can quickly go bad, no matter what type it is. The reason is its vulnerability to mold growth and high starch degradation in conditions of high humidity.\nYou can find many varieties of bread and pastries on the market nowadays, and you can find many pieces of advice on how to prolong their use. Unfortunately, there is no recipe for a significant extension of their shelf life yet.\nHow Long Does Bread Last?\nThe stability and shelf life of bakery products, including bread, will depend on the bread type, preparation method, ingredients it contains, best by date, and the way of storing.\nHow Long Does Bread Last (Chart)\n|2 to 3 days\n|2 to 3 days\n|Soft packaged bagels\n|1 to 2 weeks\n|2 to 3 days\nCooked French toast\n|6 to 8 months\n|Homemade bread dough\nRefrigerated bread dough\n|2 to 4 hours\n|By expiration date\n|Soft frozen bread dough\n|2 to 3 days\nRefrigerator biscuit dough\n|1 to 2 weeks\n6 to 8 months\nMost bakery products you can buy at the store contain preservatives that increase shelf life and prevent mold growth. The bread usually can’t stay fresh and tasty for more than 2 to 3 days without them. To be sure, always check the expiration date that manufacturers print on the label.\n4 Tips to Tell if Bread Has Gone Bad\nBread has a best by date and never have a posted expiration date. In other words, you can eat it until it becomes moldy, sour, or stale. The best you can do is check your bread for signs of spoiling before each consumption, such as:\nAs soon as bread gets an unusual odor, it is probably not safe for use. Be careful and never sniff it closely to avoid possible inhalation of mold spores. Uncommon, warning smell can be yeasty, sour like vinegar, or sharp like alcohol.\nIf you notice such a thing, get rid of bread immediately. Remember that it can be spoiled and smell awful even though you can’t see visible mold on its surface.\nThe hard texture is the apparent sign of stale bread. You can eat it if there is no visible mold, but it won’t taste well. Make croutons, French toast, or bread puddings to make it tasty.\nAs soon as bread loaf tastes sour, you should throw it away even though there is no mold on the surface. It is probably not dangerous for consumption, but it can make you sick if you have a sensitive stomach.\nWhen mold starts growing over your bread, you will see white, green, blue, grey, or black spots over its surface. They are a sure sign this product has become spoiled and not edible.\nThe first mold type appearing on stale bread is Rhizopus Stolonifer, black bread mold. Once it occurs, it is time to buy a new bread loaf. Keep in mind that you need to throw away the whole loaf, not only moldy slices, since mold can also contaminate bread below the surface.\n5 Tips to Store Bread\nEven though bread doesn’t have a long shelf life, you can store it for a while. You can do it in three common ways, but they all have both positive and negative sides.\n1. Room temperature\nNaturally, you will keep your bread in the kitchen or pantry at room temperature when you use it regularly. In fact, you don’t need to look for ways to protect it as long as it is in unopened packaging.\nHowever, always seal this food properly after opening the package. If it is impossible, use a plastic storage bag to protect sliced bread from moisture and air or place it in a bread-box.\nIf you prefer freshly made bread without packaging, the best solution is to put it in a brown paper bag. It will allow your bread to breathe and keep it from high humidity but be prepared that it will dry faster. Always store it in the cold pantry if you live in a dry and hot climate.\nNever leave bread exposed to direct sunlight if you want to use it for more than a day. When you store it at room temperature, your homemade bread will last up to four days, while store-bought is usable for a week.\nMany housewives believe that storing bread in the fridge is not an excellent option, and they avoid keeping it this way, if possible. The problem is that the low temperature dries the bread out because of the starch recrystallization.\nIt is true only if you fail to pack your bread appropriately. Once you seal it tightly and isolate it from other groceries in the fridge, it will stay moist. The best choice is to keep the original plastic packaging or put bread in a freezer bag before storing it. That way, it will remain fresh for several days longer.\nOnce you freeze your bread, it will last approximately half a year in the freezer. Make sure to keep it safe from air and moisture by storing it in airtight freezer bags.\nIt is an excellent option to preserve bread texture and taste during that period, but be aware that bread quality will decline eventually. The positive side is that freezing stops mold from growing.\nAvoid freezing a whole loaf since it is inconvenient slicing it after defrosting. Therefore, always store a sliced loaf, and thaw pieces at room temperature or in a toaster when needed.\n4. Preventing bread waste\nIf you don’t like throwing bread and want to reduce food waste, you can use it in a few ways:\n- Make homemade bread pudding, croutons, breadcrumbs, or crackers\n- Seal and store leftover bread in the freezer\n- Remove any moisture inside the packaging to prevent mold\n- Buy only as much bread as your family consumes on average\nThe Risk of Consuming an Expired Bread\nCertain risks always accompany the consumption of expired food products. It is the same with bread that can smell sour or spoiled. In most cases, the primary problem is mold.\nAlthough some fungi are safe to consume, you can’t determine which ones have caused the mold appearance. So, the best option is to avoid eating moldy bread. The most typical bread molds are:\nSome of them produce dangerous mycotoxins. Since they are poisonous, whether you inhale or eat them, you should throw out the affected loaf as soon as notice mold.\nOtherwise, mycotoxins will cause digestive problems, upset your stomach, disrupt gut bacteria, and weaken your immune system. The most hazardous is aflatoxin that may increase the risk of getting cancer.\nUnfortunately, you can’t solve the problem by heating or toasting moldy bread. Regular temperatures can’t kill fungi, and those that are high enough will burn the bread.\nCan You Freeze Bread?\nIf you like buying an extra loaf to have it just in case, the best way to keep it fresh and tasty is to freeze it. A convenient option is to put bread slices into the freezer and quickly defrost them in a few minutes when necessary.\n- Freezer bags – Pack leftovers into freezer bags and seal them tightly after removing as much air as possible.\n- Plastic container – It is an excellent solution when you want to protect your bread from smashing.\nUnlike refrigeration that speeds up the starch recrystallization, freezing won’t change bread texture and quality for months. The process of defrosting is not complicated, and you have a few options to do that successfully:\n- Countertop – Let separated slices on a plate and let them thaw in 15 and 20 minutes.\n- Toaster – Warm up frozen bread slices in the toaster, and you will get tasty bread in a few minutes.\n- Oven – Frozen bread will become fresh again after heating at 350 degrees in the oven for about 15 minutes.\nSince bread has a short shelf life at room temperature, the best option to keep it fresh for more than two days is to store it in the fridge or freezer. It is a secure way to prevent mold growth and prolong using this grocery for a week or two. Once mold appears, the only thing you can do is to throw away the loaf.", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}
{"id": "6067", "text": "Have you taken a good look at your feminine care? Menstrual cups are superior to tampons for so many reasons. Sure, tampons work well enough at preventing leaks during your period. But, there are also a number of reasons why you might consider ditching them for a menstrual cup. Reasons include the waste they create, how much they cost, as well as health considerations. You’ve trusted Mamavation to bring you topics like our tampon brand investigation, how thousands of doctors are saying chemicals are partially to blame for the obesity epidemic, which MLMs are the safest, now join us as we cover the 5 reasons why you should switch from tampons to menstrual cups during your period.\nDisclosure: Jackie Bolen is a tree-hugging, friend of the Earth who hopes that a reusable period product will one day be found in the hands of every single menstruating person in the world. She’s the author of the book, “The Ultimate Guide to Menstrual Cups.” This post contains affiliate links.\nTable of Contents\nMenstrual Cups Lessens Exposure to Toxic Chemicals\nSome of the leading brands of pads and tampons contain trace amounts of toxic chemicals in them. They mostly come from the pesticides used on the cotton, but also from the manufacturing process (bleaching, in particular, is quite toxic). Part of the problem is that in many countries, companies aren’t required to disclose what’s in these products. For example, in the USA, pads and tampon are classified as medical devices by the FDA, which is how they get around not sharing this information. The other part of the problem is that these products have harmful things in them in the first place! The good news is that there is a better solution: menstrual cups. As long as you stick with a top-quality one (I’ll give more information about that at the end of this article), you’ll have a much safer period experience, free of toxic chemicals.\nMenstrual Cups Can Help You Save Money\nThe average woman uses over 11,000 tampons in her lifetime. Those 11,000 tampons? They can add up to around $2200 USD during a lifetime. Over on Amazon USA, you can buy a bulk pack of tampons that works out to about $0.20 per tampon. That’s about the cheapest you can find them—they’re significantly more expensive if you buy them at your local drugstore for example. Compare this to a menstrual cup that costs around $30 USD. If you use eight of them over your 40 or so menstruating years, that works out to $240. Or, almost 10x cheaper than tampons. Start early for maximum benefits. Not bad, right? After all, who doesn’t like to have more money in the bank at the end of the month!\nAnd, in a world where young people are missing school because they can’t afford period products, something like a menstrual cup can really make a huge difference. Even in a well-off country like Canada, 1 in 7 girls are missing school because they lack period products. The numbers are far higher in underdeveloped countries. Consider opting for a menstrual cup that has a buy-one-give-one kind of program for maximum impact. The ones that I know of include the Daisycup, Ruby Cup, and the Pixie Cup.\nMenstrual Cups Lessen the Risk of Toxic Shock Syndrome\nLet’s talk TSS. It’s a serious, sometimes deadly disease that is thankfully quite rare. However, many of the cases that do occur, occur because of using tampons. That said, when you consider how many people use tampons around the world, the risk is not high, especially if you take the basic precaution of changing your tampon frequently enough.\nWhat about menstrual cups? In theory, the risk of TSS is there, but to date, only one person has ever gotten Toxic Shock Syndrome from a menstrual cup.You may have seen the recent hype about how menstrual cups have a high risk of TSS? It was based on one study, done in a lab and not on people so it’s probably not something to really worry about. Just be sure to empty and clean your cup frequently enough. Even though fewer people use menstrual cups, it does appear that the risk is lower than with tampons.\nMenstrual Cups Help The Environment\nEstimates vary from 10,000-20,000, but it’s thought that the average person uses at least 11,000 tampons during a lifetime. This can be considerably more if you have a heavy, long or irregular period. If you menstruate for 40 years (from ages 10-50), and have 13 periods in a year, that ends up being a ridiculous amount of tampons!\nThe worst environmental offenders are the tampons that come with plastic applicators. However, even the ones without applicators come wrapped in little bits of plastic that’ll take centuries (500-800 years to be exact) to degrade in the landfill. Compare this to a menstrual cup. While some companies like the Diva Cup recommend replacing it every year or two, most people find that a high-quality one can last for 5-10 years. Just be sure to buy one that’s made from medical grade silicone, and not some lower-quality material. This means a handful of menstrual cups over a lifetime compared to thousands of tampons. Try holding those 11,000 tampons in two hands and see how it goes.\nThere’s also more good news about menstrual cups. You can often recycle them when they do wear out. Check with your local municipality to see if they accept silicone products. Or, check in with your local sex toy shop and they may accept it. It really does make a big difference for our Earth when you make the switch from tampons to a period cup. Imagine the possibilities if every single menstruating person in the world was using a reusable period product instead of a disposable one?\nMenstrual Cups are just so Much Better\nThe final reason why you might consider ditching tampons is that menstrual cups are just so much better. They are eco-friendly, cheaper over the medium to long-term, and better for our health. But, what about convenience? Although you do have to wash menstrual cups (as opposed to tampons which you throw into the trash), most people find that this isn’t really a big deal. You just have to wash your cup with a mild soap or menstrual cup wash every time you take it out. Then, you can boil your cup in a pot of water on the stove for five minutes at the end of your cycle. It takes just a few minutes and most people find that it’s worth it.\nWhere the convenience thing really comes through is if you have a very heavy period. The average cup has a capacity of 30 ml, while a jumbo tampon only holds 10 ml or so. 3x more capacity means that you might actually be able to sleep through the night of your heaviest flow. There are even high capacity menstrual cups with room for 40 ml or more. Pair up one of these with an overnight pad (I use a cloth one) and even when you have a heavy flow, you’ll be able to sleep peacefully without waking up to that soggy, squishy feeling!\nWhich Menstrual Cup to Choose?\nIf you search on Amazon for “menstrual cups,” you’ll notice that there are more than 100 of them. And then each brand has different styles and sizes. It can be a bit overwhelming trying to decide which one will work best for you. That’s why I recommend taking a menstrual cup quiz. There are a few simple questions that’ll help you narrow down the choices. You can check one out here. Beyond that, here are some of the main factors to consider when choosing a cup.\n#1: Vaginal Birth, or Not\nCompanies recommend their small, medium or large menstrual cup based on a number of different factors, including age, vaginal birth, flow, or cervix height.\nHowever, in my experience, having given birth vaginally (or not) is one of the most important factors. If you haven’t given birth, then go for a smaller diameter menstrual cup of around 40-42 mm. If you’re a very small person, or a teenager, then you may want to go for one smaller than 40 mm.\nIf you have given birth vaginally, then choose a bigger menstrual cup with a diameter of more than 43 mm.\n#2: Cervix Height\nAlong with whether or not you’ve given birth, the other important factor to consider is the height of your cervix. Looking on YouTube for, “How to measure cervix height” is a good place to start.\nIf you have a high cervix, go for a menstrual cup longer than 70 mm. If a low cervix, you’ll want to use a cup between 50-60 mm in length. For an average height cervix, a cup between 65-70 mm should work well for you.\nFind out more about diameters and lengths here: Menstrual Cup Comparison Chart.\nMost menstrual cups are made from silicone, while a few of them are made from Thermoplastic Elastomer (the Oi Cup, Meluna, and Hello Cup), while the Keeper Cup is made from latex.\nI don’t really recommend the Keeper Cup because it’s very stiff, and some people are allergic to latex.\nSilicone cups work well, but the key is to make sure it’s medical grade. You’ll see words like diamond, platinum or food grade in some of the product descriptions on Amazon, but these ones should be avoided. After all, it’s a product that you’re putting into your body for up to a week each month!\n#4: Customer Reviews\nOften, the best indicator of menstrual cup quality is found in the customer reviews on Amazon. Generally, you’ll want to find ones that have more than 100 reviews and an average rating of 4.3/5 or higher.\nCheck the 3-4 star reviews carefully to find out the pros and cons. Often the 1-2 star reviews are from people who just don’t like menstrual cups in general so may not be that helpful for you.\nAre there Any Brands You Recommend?\nI’m happy you asked! There are several really good mentrual cups out there and I’ve taken the liberty to link them up to Amazon for your convenience.", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}
{"id": "6071", "text": "Do You See It Yet, White America?\nCan you see it?\nAre any more white people waking up out there?\nDo you see what’s going on, what has been going on? Do you see it now?\nIf I hear one more white person say: “Why is all this bad stuff happening to Black people, it just doesn’t make sense,” I might resort to one of the temper tantrums I use to throw when I was five years old.\nFor the love of God, everything that is happening—EVERYTHING makes perfect sense when you acknowledge the depth and power of white supremacy culture and patriarchy:\n- The chaotic and dangerous responses to Coronavirus by the Federal Government\n- The persistent over policing of Black and Brown people\n- The fact that white men who murder and terrorize whoever they choose move freely among this country everyday\n- White Christians thinking it should be their choice whether they worship or not in a global pandemic\n- The way consumption economies cost people their lives\nIt all makes sense.\nIt doesn’t even take a whole lot of critical thinking to understand white supremacy and its most deployed weapons: intimidation, ignorance, and terror. I promise, you will be a whole lot less bewildered if you will just admit it to yourself—white supremacy culture is a menace to society and it has been for a LONG time. And it has helped to form all of us.\nAnd I am saying this as someone deeply formed by white supremacy culture. I am saying this as someone who benefits from being competent and successful in this systems set up by white supremacy culture. I am saying this as someone has a vested interest in keeping this white capitalist rule in place. So, why do I KEEP saying these things, some might ask?\nIt’s simple. One word. It’s one thing that keeps me going even when I feel like giving up, even when I feel like there is no point in even trying to talk to white people about this anymore. Here’s why: LOVE.\nThat’s right, even with all the horrible stuff that human beings with too much power do, even with the bewildering destruction that white supremacy culture has done, I still love this world and ALL the people in it. And that is WHY I keep saying this stuff. Love abides.\nAnd love is only true when it is founded in truth.\nFor love to win, we need more truth.\nLove is not going to win by everybody being nice. Sorry white people, “nice” is not going to fix this problem. In fact, nice actually makes this mess worse. “Nice” enables white supremacy to flourish. Nice is a friend to gas-lighters and oppressors, not to the impacted and the suffering.\nIn fact the origins of the word “nice” tell us it originally meant foolish or stupid. “Nice” is nowhere in the Bible. And “nice” is not the same thing as “kind,” which is closely aligned with words like helpful, gentle, understanding.\nSo, white people, forget what your mama told you, forget what your grandma told you, forget what your teacher told you about “being nice.” It doesn’t make the world a better place. It makes the world a more hospitable place for white supremacy culture to have its way with all of us.\nLOVE is kind, but it’s not “nice.” Love is courageous. It is able to see beautiful possibilities. It believes that we can stop hurting each other. Love knows that the most important thing we can do is be wise about how power can be used and abused.\nPOWER is the capacity to have an impact. It is something we all have in different gradations. One of the hallmarks of white supremacy culture is POWER HOARDING. So, love is about sharing power. Love is about:\n- Using our power in ways that don’t do harm.\n- Checking our power so that it doesn’t become a tool of abuse, oppression, or violence.\n- Being careful with the ways we use our power together.\n- Figuring out how to use our power for the common good to create a healthy society.\nWhich brings me to the thing I really want to say to my white siblings who move about the world as white people: stop saying the pain of the world doesn’t make sense! It’s not really confusing at all when you just tell yourself the truth. The culture that formed ALL of us in the United States of America, and really all over the colonized world, has socialized us all to be foolish about what’s happening to us and through us.\nStop being foolish! And find the courage to see what is right in front of you—a culture that has a sick relationship with power, a culture that needs healing, a culture that needs to learn how to love.\nTake A Closer Look\nWhat we’re seeing right now in this latest chaotic stage of the pandemic saga is white supremacy culture taking the wheel again. The government is giving us permission to be foolish, because being wise will hurt the economy. The government is giving us the freedom to hurt ourselves and each other because things work better in this economy when we don’t really understand what freedom is. And people with too much power want you to believe that abuse of power and exploitation are just politics at work.\nWhat we’re seeing with the murder of Ahmaud Arbery in GA is white supremacy still in charge of the law books and the cultural narrative. Laws legalize white terror. And wisdom tells us that legality has long been a tool of white terror in America. That wisdom tells us that the circular argument of “feeling threatened” and “self-defense” as a legal reason to hurt someone that you have learned to fear and learned to hate only seems to work in our legal system for white men with guns. It’s the tail wagging the dog. Racism authorizing racism. Racialized bias justifying racialized violence.\nWhat we’re seeing with the racial disparities of COVID 19 is white supremacy culture’s ability to seep into our tissues, our organs, our cells. It knows how to diminish us, it knows how to debilitate us. Living with full knowledge everyday that the powers that be are not there to protect you or to make your world trustworthy is a degenerative disease. When bodies hold trauma, a virus like COVID 19 sees an opportunity and the disparities in health care help make it more effective.\nWhat we’re seeing in the armed white mobs at the courthouse steps demanding their freedom to be self-destructive is an unfiltered look at how good white supremacy is at harvesting minds. Its capacity to make us foolish is unrivaled. And it has been an effective tool for a LONG, LONG time. White mobs know how to get a good idea replaced with foolish ones.\nFoolish Minds Think Alike\nAnd, so, here we are. Forget science, forget community, forget what has been proven to make the world a better place. Forget all that! And instead put your priorities where white supremacy wants and needs them to be—let’s get this economy moving again, let’s get people back in church so they can believe God blesses dominance, let’s get people back to believing that if you work hard enough then you will get what you deserve.\nThere’s only one thing that can make such foolishness sound like a good idea: white supremacy culture when its back is up against the wall. Don’t sleep on this culture’s ability to convince us all that being foolish is the best thing we can do to get things back to normal.\nWake up, white people. White culture isn’t superior; it’s just really good at using people like us to do its dirty work.", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

To help you keep track of their nutrition and provide them with the required nutrients in the right amounts, you could use a balanced diet chart for toddlers or a food pyramid (a nutrition tool).\nA balanced diet ensures healthy eating for kids and should include foods from all the major food groups, namely proteins, dairy, fruits, vegetables, and grains. A global United Nations International Children’s Emergency Fund (UNICEF) report highlights that about one in two children aged below five experiences hidden hunger caused by deficiencies in vitamins and essential nutrients. Therefore, parents must provide adequate and appropriate amounts of each food type to help children stay healthy and active.\nRead on to learn about following a balanced diet for toddlers, what nutrients are required for it, and its benefits.\nWhat Is A Balanced Diet For A Toddler?\nA balanced diet is highly beneficial for the health and well-being of your toddlers.

In addition, vitamins are essential nutrient requirements that assist in overall child development, including boosting the immune system, promoting growth and development, and aiding the functioning of the cells and various organs. Vitamin A is necessary for good vision. Vitamin C acts as an immune booster and supports brain functioning. Vitamin D is necessary for effective calcium absorption.

The draft cited the incident in April 2008 wherein Somali pirates seized a French luxury yacht, Le Ponant, holding 30 crewmembers hostage for nearly a week . After the ship’s owners paid a ransom to the pirates and the crewmembers were released, the French military intervened and arrested six of the suspected 12 pirates in a land chase.\nHowever, the French operation was conducted after gaining the approval of the Somali transitional government. The new resolution would seek approval for a six-month period that would authorize states to board, search, and seize vessels engaged or believed to be engaged in acts of piracy or armed robbery. Additionally, the resolution would allow states to arrest and prosecute pirates who are seized in Somali territory, on land or by sea.\nSomali pirate gangs have committed at least a dozen pirate attacks off the Somali coast in 2008 and have showed no signs of slowing in the near-term. Passing the resolution and effectively prosecuting pirates in international courts would likely help curb attacks in the mid to long-term.\nA Lucrative Practice\nAt least a dozen pirate attacks off the Somali coast have so far occurred in 2008. The hijacking of foreign vessels for ransom has become a lucrative activity for Somali pirate gangs. A brief list of recent attacks is provided below:\n• April 26, 2008: Somali pirates released a Spanish fishing trawler and its 26 crewmembers after an unknown source paid a ransom of US$1.2 million.\n• April 11, 2008: The French government paid US$2 million to pirates on board Le Ponant before the French military intervened.\n• March 19, 2008: Somali pirates released a Danish-owned tugboat after the ship’s owners paid a ransom of US$700,000.\nWhile offering ransom payments increases the chances that hostages will not be harmed, the practice is setting a dangerous precedent that will likely encourage continued pirate attacks in the near-term.\nStepping Up Prosecutions\nOn April 28, 2008 a Somali judge sentenced seven pirates arrested in the semi-autonomous Puntland region to life in prison. The seven men were connected to the hijacking of the Dubai-flagged ship, al-Khaleej, in late April 2008 (Source).\nAdditionally, the six pirates captured after hijacking the Le Ponant are awaiting trial in a French court for theft and the abduction and detention of hostages with the intention of obtaining a ransom. Although they will likely receive a lighter sentencing compared to the terms given in the Somali court, tougher legal penalties would complement the resolution’s call for international assistance in patrolling and pursuing pirates in Somali waters.\nIntervention Required to Improve Security\nA collaborated maritime security plan has proven to be an effective method to combat pirate activity in the past. For example, the Malacca Strait was once plagued by high levels of pirate activity and attacks, but the Straits’ littoral states, Malaysia, Singapore, and Indonesia have stepped up patrols and security in recent years. This effort has resulted in a significant drop in reported pirate incidents for the vital waterway. Further, no incidents were reported in the first quarter of 2008 (Previous Report).\nAccording to US officials, it remains unclear when the resolution would be passed due to several legal issues. Still, with Somalia lacking a Navy and considerable military forces, the resolution would likely improve security in the mid to long-term as it would provide states the legal means to search, respond, and capture pirates off the Horn of Africa.", "scores": {"score": 3, "score_transform_1": 5, "score_transform_2": 5, "score_transform_3": 0}}

{"id": "6252", "text": "Uncontrolled workplace stress can take a toll on your health. Without appropriate tools and techniques to manage your stress levels, it’s not uncommon for people to experience sleep disturbances, anxiety, weakened immune systems, and even depression.\nWorkplace stress shouldn’t consume your whole life, but it has the potential to. If you’re worried about work-related stress affecting your personal life and general health, consider taking some of the following actions.\nManage the Symptoms\nIf you’re not yet in a strong position to eradicate the cause of your stress, start by managing the symptoms. For example, if you’re experiencing fatigue, you might prioritize more sleep. If you’re feeling anxious, you might purchase a Delta-9 gummy and see if you feel calmer and more at ease when you get home from work. Managing the symptoms should only be the first step of a long-term strategy for workplace stress management, but it can still be an excellent place to begin.\nMany people experience increased stress in business when they don’t have firm boundaries. If you say ‘yes’ to every task and request, it can only be a matter of time before you become overwhelmed and burned out.\nDespite your desire to work hard, knowing that it might lead to recognition or even a promotion in the future, you might need to improve your health and stress levels. Set boundaries with colleagues, friends, and even family members, to protect yourself. This can mean saying no to a request, even if it means the other person is disadvantaged.\nVery few successful business owners and managers got to where they are today by doing everything themselves. Instead, they surround themselves with competent employees they can delegate to. Business success is a team effort.\nWhether you’re in a management position or not, don’t be afraid to delegate tasks if it’s the difference between being stressed and feeling in control. If you’re unable to delegate, talk to your management team about your work obligations and ask them to prioritize your tasks in order of importance.\nLeave Work At Work\nAs tempting as it can be to check work emails while relaxing on the sofa at home or making a quick call to the office before dinner, try your best to change your habits. You’re likely not getting paid to work from home after work hours and take care of work tasks on time.\nIf it has generally been an expectation that you’re available at all times to discuss work, consider setting boundaries. You should be able to use your free time to spend with friends and family without your job interrupting.\nYour employer likely won’t be aware of your stress levels unless you talk to them about it. They might assume you’re happy with how much work you have and the hours you’re working to ensure it’s done to a high standard. However, if your work starts affecting your health and happiness, communicate this to them early on. If they can’t put steps in place to help you change that, it might be time to seek employment elsewhere.\nManaging workplace stress is never easy, especially since stress doesn’t usually appear overnight. If you’re noticing that your mental and physical health is suffering due to the demands of your professional life, it might be time to consider taking these actions above.", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

{"id": "6263", "text": "Animator Satoshi Kon still inspires long after his untimely death, writes Nathanael Smith\nSupport independent, non-corporate media.\nFive years ago this month, the Japanese animator and director Satoshi Kon died at the age of 46. It was a tragic loss to see such a promising and brilliant talent die so young, after only directing four feature films and a television series, Paranoia Agent. I’ve only encountered the genius of the director recently, and so far I’ve only seen two of his films. As such, this tribute is an incomplete one, and merely a collection of thoughts based on Paprika and Tokyo Godfathers. It’s the journey of someone discovering a great for the first time as opposed to the praise of a lifelong fan.\nThe first thing I noticed when I stepped into the world of Satoshi Kon was that Christopher Nolan’s Inception owes Paprika such a massive debt that it dangerously blurs the line between homage and theft. It’s easy to see why someone like Nolan would be drawn to Paprika. It’s an insane, multi-layered film about a dream-detective. It’s the kind of dizzying sci-fi that absolutely demands you engage your brain as you follow the several interlocking dream narratives. Kon conjures up some striking images throughout, arguably making far more of the cerebral setting than Nolan manages by embracing the surrealism of the dream world. By many accounts, Perfect Blue and Millennium Actress, the two Kon films I’m yet to see, share this invention and intelligence.\nTokyo Godfathers is about three homeless people – a teenage girl, an ageing man with regrets and a transgender woman – who discover an abandoned baby on Christmas Eve. It’s a very human film, warm towards the three protagonists yet unafraid to show them as flawed and broken. There’s very little in the way of fantasy here, but it highlights one of Kon’s huge strengths in just how expressive the faces of his characters are. By contrast, Studio Ghibli’s animation often has lushly-detailed landscapes but character animation that often has blank faces with a limited number of expressions (except, curiously, the old people in those films). Kon’s characters have a totally different look, with faces that squash and stretch and convey a wealth of emotions. The framing, which is occasionally reminiscent of Ozu’s wide, static shots, creates a space for these vividly detailed people to work out their problems, often melodramatically but always expressively and in a way that only animation can achieve.\nVideo essayist Tony Zhou picked up on Kon’s ability to show things that only animation can through the way he edits his films. His analysis of Kon’s canon is well worth a watch – see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oz49vQwSoTE as is his celebration of Mamoru Hosoda’s wonderful Wolf Children. Zhou points out the way that Kon uses match cuts to blur reality and fantasy and to keep the pace breathless. I think that’s why people who don’t normally give much attention to animation champion the work of Kon: his films are inherently cinematic. Whether it’s in his plots that juggle a varied cast of colourful characters, in the ingenuity of his storytelling or in the craftsmanship behind each of his films, Kon made his work look and feel like proper cinema.\nIf, like me, Satoshi Kon is still fairly new to you, seek out Paprika. It’s a dazzlingly inventive and emotionally rich film, and shows exactly why Kon is lauded as one of animation’s greats. It’s tragic that he died so young, but the work he left behind will leave a long-lasting legacy. I’m glad that I still have some of it to discover.", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}
{"id": "6267", "text": "From the Office of the Provost\nEpisode 6: Rethinking the General Education Curriculum at the University of Pittsburgh\nJoe McCarthy: Hello and welcome to “From the Office of the Provost,” a podcast that highlights exciting activities and initiatives in the Office of the Provost or University-wide that bolster and enhance our collective vision for growth and transformation. I'm your host, Interim Provost Joe McCarthy, and today I'm joined by Belkys Torres, Associate Vice Provost for Inclusive Excellence in Education.\nBelkys joined the Office of the Provost in January of 2023 to lead efforts in increasing educational equity. Her focus is on identifying and working toward the removal of academic and structural barriers to student persistence and completion, with an emphasis on those issues that disproportionately impact select student groups.\nAside from her role in our office, she also holds a position of teaching assistant professor of Latinx and Gender Studies for the Literature Program in the Department of English. However, as I think much of our audience likely knows, Belkys is not new to Pitt. She joined the University in 2015, [most recently] serving as the Executive Director of Global Engagement at the University Center for International Studies.\nNow she's heading Pitt’s new General Education Task Force, which will work to rethink the University's general education curriculum. And that's primarily the subject of our discussion today. Welcome, Belkys.\nBelkys Torres: Thanks, Joe. I'm glad to be here.\nMcCarthy: So Belkys, before we get to my questions for you, I want to set the tone a little bit here for a couple of reasons. You and I are well familiar with this project to focus on general education reform and building the task force. But I think it's important to really give some context to our audience both why this role fits the project, so your role as Associate Vice Provost for Inclusive Excellence in Education, and then also what the history of you know, general education at Pitt looks like. And then from there, you can tell us where we're headed.\nFor our audience, you know, in my role as Vice Provost for Undergraduate Studies, I really wanted to focus on, on reducing structural barriers to completion for students, writ large. And one of the things, as we'll talk about in a minute, that we noticed was disproportionately harming some students was, was the disparate nature of our general education curriculum. So while Belkys’s role is clearly much more expansive than just looking at general education topics, this really fits into the overall structure and design for what her role would be long term.\nSo, so Belkys, you know, as you know, the general learning outcomes were actually defined by what we used to call the Council of Deans back in 2004. And they've really served us well, for a long time. But that being nearly 20 years ago, now, when, when that first came out, they're getting a little bit long in the tooth, if you will. They led to a realization of those learning outcomes across our six first-year admitting schools in different ways.\nAnd while that has served us well over those 20 years, in this new era of collaboration where we launched the School of Computing and Information, and they're partnering with the Dietrich School and with others to build joint programs across schools, and with the increasing intellectual curiosity of a typical Pitt student who really doesn't want to be hampered by barriers between schools.\nHaving different general education curricula across different units at Pitt has really resulted in some issues in recent years, like extended time to degree, which can lead to increases in debt load, could artificially deflate our graduation rates. And another really important topic for Pitt in the coming years is going to be our accessibility for transfer students. And I think the fact that we have a host of different general education curricula across the campus has caused some difficulty in building articulation agreements, etc.\nSo you know, when you joined the office, of course, I was excited to task you with, with this long term, very expansive project. But given, given how well known you are across campus, and just your expertise in bringing people together, I think that this was almost a tailor-made project for you. So, can you tell me, how will the General Education Task Force engage with members of the Pitt community? This is a really big project that involves really all of the schools and in fact, all of the campuses. And so, can you tell us a little bit about how you're going to engage with the group around this curriculum project?\nTorres: Absolutely. I think there are two really cool things about this project that excite me first and foremost. One is the ability to come together with faculty, staff, advisors from across schools and campuses to imagine our future together. And so part of this project is really asking ourselves the question around: Who and what do our future Pitt graduates look like? What will they be able to know? What will they be able to do after completing our general education program? Who do we want them to be? And how does this curriculum allow them to achieve those goals? So taking a peek into the future is a cool concept, I think, and the ability to craft that I think is interesting.\nThe other piece is that this task force will have an opportunity to engage in research, as well as dialogue. And the reason for that is we're trying to figure out ways to better align or refresh existing curricula to offer more enriching and integrated academic experience for our undergrads.\nSo what does that look like? The task force is going to begin the work by conducting an internal curricula review. As you mentioned, there's about nine different general education curricula at the moment across our schools and campuses. And so we're trying to figure out what's the best of all of those worlds? What's really working in each one of those? And how do we get to a more streamline general education curriculum?\nWe're also tasking this this group of folks to do external benchmarking, right, because we can learn a lot from folks around the country who have already done really good work in this area that can inspire the work that we will do here at Pitt.\nAnd the hope is that in doing this, we'll meet two objectives. One will review and refresh our institutional student learning outcomes. As you said, they're outdated. There's room for growth and innovation in that space. And then it allows us the opportunity to reexamine our general education requirements, so that we can prioritize essential skills and abilities like critical thinking, leadership, data analysis, intercultural global competency, communication, collaboration, right.\nThe other thing that the task force will be doing soon, as soon as this term, in fact, is to start with a listening tour, where we're trying to reach across schools and campuses to host in-person and online gatherings to solicit feedback from our community and learn from all voices in all walks of life. The student voice and experience is going to be crucial to this work as this is a student-centered project. And so we want to be sure that we provide opportunities to listen and learn from those who are experiencing our curriculum right now.\nWe're also relying on the expertise of all kinds of established groups at Pitt like [the Provost’s Advisory Committee on Undergraduate Programs] and the Faculty Senate Educational Policies Committee, Student Government, the Provost’s Academic Leadership Team, the Undergraduate Advising Council, and many others to ensure that our thinking is regularly guided by the counsel and advice of these experts. So, you'll see us attend regularly scheduled meetings, you'll see us on your agenda, if you're part of these groups. And if you're not, you also have the opportunity to engage with us online.\nSo we're providing engagement opportunities for folks through a new [webpage] that will launch really soon, to provide comments to provide feedback to ensure that all experiences and opinions are shared.\nMcCarthy: Excellent. Thank you. That's really exciting how inclusive that process is going to be. And I think it's outstanding that you're planning on leaning on, really the diverse expertise that we have across all of our campuses and within the Pittsburgh campus. Beyond that, though, how are you engaging nationally to inform what you're doing?\nTorres: You know, it's really interesting, as I've begun the work of talking with deans and associate deans and vice provosts and presidents, a lot of times I get asked this question about, \"So what is the problem that we're actually trying to address here?\" Right? And my response is that we're striving for a level of uniformity across our student learning outcomes and our general education curriculum, while also leaving room for each school on campus to tailor their curriculum in ways that align with offerings across their majors and minors.\nAs you can imagine, this is a complicated problem at a highly decentralized institution like Pitt that has currently multiple Gen Ed curriculum. And so the opportunity here is to look at what our peers and our aspirational peers have recently completed by way of general education reform, so that we can learn the valuable lessons that they're sharing and we can connect across professional networks to do that.\nAnd so we're seeing reputable professional associations like the American Association for Colleges and Universities, the Association for Undergraduate Education at Research Universities, dedicate entire academic meetings, conferences, and other publication opportunities, for example, to this work. And so a lot of this will be informed not only by working in isolation here in Pittsburgh and across our regional campuses, but really engaging in what is already a national dialogue, so that we're both following the lead of some while also trying to become leaders ourselves in this particular space.\nMcCarthy: Excellent, thank you. If we take a step back and think about articulating this vision to maybe a broader audience than just those that are educators, you know, part of our responsibility within higher ed is preparing engaged and informed graduates for the ever-changing challenges of the world. Can you tell us how we might lean on this general education project when it's done to best prepare our students for that?\nTorres: You know, I think what's really exciting here is that we have an opportunity to bring faculty, students, staff, and alumni together to explore what it means when we try to create, as Paul Hanstedt is describing, “liberated human beings, meaning people who are independent and flexible in their thinking, and capable of responding to the demands of a changing world in ways that are deliberate and civic minded.” Right? And this is really an important part of this project.\nExperts on general education reform also remind us that this work is founded upon one fundamental assertion, and that is the purpose of liberal education is to encourage undergraduate students to develop essential skills, breadth of knowledge, and critical self-awareness that prepares them for an increasingly complex and diverse world.\nSo what does this mean for Pitt? Well, this means that a well balanced and streamlined liberal arts curriculum is also one that will emphasize an appreciation of the interdisciplinary nature of subject areas, right, and acceptance of persons of different backgrounds or values from one's own, and a deepened sense of self. So the exciting opportunity here is that we get to do this creative work collectively, right? And that we can do so by learning from our own experts, so that we can build on the good work that's already begun, at the schools level and at the level of our regional campuses, to one, modernize our student learning outcomes, and two, create one general education curriculum that helps students achieve that.\nMcCarthy: Great. So with this initiative, of course, we're bringing together thoughts and experiences and a vision for a Pitt education from faculty, students, staff, alumni, and, and all members of the Pitt community. With that many moving pieces, though, I alluded to early on that I was giving you a pretty big task as one of your first jobs as associate vice provost. Can you walk us through the timeline for the project?\nTorres: Absolutely. So as this is a complicated project, but one that will require thought and careful deliberation, and conversation and analysis. So we're expecting a three-year timeline, at least to get us to a pilot concept, right.\nSo that means that right now, we are launching the task force later this month, and we're really excited about that. The work, the preliminary work ahead for this semester and into 2024 is really about collecting data, doing research, internal and external, engaging with all of our audiences and stakeholders, and getting to a place where we have a sense of our collective thinking, \"Where are we right now? Where do we want to be? How do we want to get there?\"\nIn our second year of this project, then it's a matter of using that data that we've collected, as well as the existing research on general education reform, to start thinking about and developing curricular models for consideration. So, what could be some of the ways in which we actually streamline a general education curriculum? What does that look like? How do we modernize our student learning outcomes? What do they look like? How do we achieve those, right?\nAnd the hope is that by the end of that second year, we have some ideas to share with our community, that we start to receive feedback from our experts. And that we get to a place where we start elevating this to the leadership elements of our community that actually have approving responsibilities for this in the end, right.\nThe third part then in year three is to start planning and triaging and figuring out how do we make this work? Right. So how does implementation look like? How do we operationalize this? How do we make this a streamlined approach, not only for our students, but for their advisors, for their faculty, for the entire community? And then what does it look like when we launch in our pilot year, right?\nAnd so to get all of this done, we're going to be dividing the task force into different thematic working groups to accomplish this goal. So there will be some that will be tasked with curricular design, others that will be focused on operationalizing and implementing the curriculum and the student learning outcome. And then another group looking at the administration of the general education curriculum into the future, as well as the assessment of student learning outcomes over time.\nMcCarthy: Great, so given how many folks, how broad the interest in this project is likely to be, how can people get connected? I know you mentioned doing some surveys and so forth. How can people get connected with this initiative and really stay up to date on the progress?\nTorres: Absolutely. So we're excited to be launching a new section of the Provost website dedicated to the General Education Reform Initiative, so folks can visit provost.pitt.edu and search under General Ed, you'll also see it on the Highlights section of that website.\nWe are committed to transparency and storytelling throughout this process, so folks can expect to see a full list of our task force, a full list of those who are advising the task force and informing the work, as well as updates and stories on how we're doing, what we're reading, what we're talking about, what events and activities are coming up, and how people can get involved.\nMcCarthy: Excellent. Well, thank you, Belkys, for joining me today and sharing the great work that you're leading. As you know, I'm really excited about this project.\nAnd as usual, thank you listeners for tuning in.

Marisa and I have known each other since we were eleven, and went to middle school and high school together. There was no way I WASN'T flying across the country to go to her wedding. But it was a great excuse for the rest of the trip! The night before and night of the wedding, I decided to treat myself to a real hotel (rather than the airBNB's I was mostly staying in. AND (because I was, after all, on vacation) I decided to spend my time leading up to the wedding at my hotel pool. Although it was a day off driving, I decided it wasn't a day off sketching. So I sketched people at the pool!\nI got ready for the wedding (uneventful) and headed out an hour and fifteen minutes before the wedding was set to start. Without traffic it would have taken me fifteen minutes. And thus began my introduction to terrible LA traffic. I had already experienced terrible LA drivers (I'm convinced they believe that every twitch of the wheel and turn signal must be accompanied by unsolicited honking), and what I now realize was milk LA traffic, but this was the first time I felt like I was in a parking lot. It took me 45 minutes to get to the wedding, but luckily I was still early! No time to sketch prior to the wedding, as I hoped, but plenty to schmooze with the other guests.\nThe wedding itself was at the Bel-Air Bay Club, a beautiful venue with a view of the ocean. The ceremony was on the lawn, facing the Pacific. Water was available as we walked in (genius!). It was officiated by both a rabbi and a priest, and was very touching. Luckily I wasn't trying to keep from crying, because I found out that looking at the bride's mother during the ceremony is NOT the way to keep from tearing up!\nAfterwards, the cocktail hour was in a courtyard with a bubbling fountain, and the two musicians playing acoustic guitar from the ceremony continued to serenade us. There were brilliant appetizers, drinks made with fire (it's a long story), and excellent conversation. We continued inside for the reception, were joined by the bride and groom, and danced the night away. The only break from the dancing was for the fantastic dinner (anyone who knows me knows it's a big thing if I rave about the salad. But, y'all. The salad.)\nI decided to do one token sketch. I cheated and worked from a photo one of my tablemates took on his phone (Thanks, Matt!), and worked on it between courses. And of course, immediately gave it to the happy couple.

A hundred and eighty-eight patients with detailed thyroid hormone levels at diagnosis of DLBCL were enrolled. Low T3 syndrome was defined as a low serum free T3 (FT3) level with low or normal serum free tetraiodothyronine (FT4) and thyroid stimulating hormone levels.

Receiver-operator characteristic curves and the corresponding areas under the curve were calculated to assess the predictive accuracy of International Prognostic Index (IPI) and low T3 syndrome. Twenty-four patients were diagnosed with low T3 syndrome, which was associated with worse PFS and OS in the rituximab era. It was an independent prognostic factor for PFS and OS, especially for those with IPI 0-2, extranodal sites ≤1 and stage III-IV. Synchronously low FT3 and FT4 had poorer survival outcome compared to only low FT3 and adding criterion of low T3 syndrome improved the prognostic capacity of IPI for predicting PFS and OS in DLBCL.

Whilst you may think that's what you need, it might not be. So, a good coach shouldn't sell themselves first. In my opinion that would be unethical. I would be looking to see whether you need a business coach.\nCoaches come in many forms; and I regularly refer prospects to life coaches, executive coaches and mindset coaches. All of whom perform different functions.\nIf a Business Coach is definitely what you need I move onto step #2.\nI swear a bit, wear T-Shirts to work (and smart shoes and smart jeans!), and I have fun during coaching sessions whilst also being a human being, considerate and sensitive to my clients' needs. I have no formal coaching qualifications aside from my 17 years in business and having worked with many hundreds of business owners. My approach isn't for everyone. We might establish that Business Coaching is for you, but I might not be the right Business Coach for you.\nFinally, and only finally, do I start to match you up with the right coaching programme. It may even be that Business Coaching is for you and I might be the right Coach, but my Coaching Programmes might NOT be a good fit. This is absolutely fine.\nDuring the consultation/diagnostic process I will be looking to see what outcomes you would like to see from being coached. If my programmes can't deliver that outcome then I will say so at this point. This happens during approximately 20% of my consultations.\nThe key thing to remember, if you are searching for a business coach, is that a consultation with a coach should NEVER be a sales pitch. Ideally you will be speaking 70% of the time and the coach 30% of the time. And the coach in front of you should be just as happy if they hear a, \"No!\" as they are in hearing a, \"Yes!\". Because either option is the right outcome for you and your business. If the entire consultation is all, \"Me! Me! Me!\" then walk away.\nStruggling to know where to look. Then here is a hand-picked selection of coaches who I would trust my life with...", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

{"id": "6328", "text": "A top Sri Lanka official on Tuesday called the Easter attack on churches, hotels and other sites “retaliation” for the shooting massacre by a white supremacist at two New Zealand mosques last month, as the Islamic State group sought to claim responsibility for the attack.\nRuwan Wijewardene, the state minister of defence, told Parliament the government possessed information that the bombings were carried out “by an Islamic fundamentalist group” in response to the Christchurch attacks. He also blamed “weakness” within Sri Lanka’s security apparatus for failing to prevent the nine bombings.\n“By now it has been established that the intelligence units were aware of this attack and a group of responsible people were informed about the impending attack,” Wijewardene said. “However, this information has been circulated among only a few officials.”\nWijewardene’s comments came shortly before the Islamic State group asserted it was responsible for the bombings in and outside of Colombo that killed over 320 people. But neither Wijewardene nor IS provided evidence to immediately support their claims, and authorities previously blamed a little-known Islamic extremist group in the island nation for the attack.\nThe office of New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern issued a statement responding to the Christchurch claim that described Sri Lanka’s investigation as “in its early stages.”\n“New Zealand has not yet seen any intelligence upon which such an assessment might be based,” it said. An Australian white supremacist, Brenton Harrison Tarrant, livestreamed the March 15 shootings.\nAuthorities announced a nationwide curfew would begin at 9 p.m. Tuesday.\nAs Sri Lanka’s leaders wrangled with the implications of an apparent militant attack and massive intelligence failure, security was heightened Tuesday for a national day of mourning and the military was employing powers to make arrests it last used during a devastating civil war that ended in 2009.\nThe six near-simultaneous attacks on three churches and three luxury hotels and three related blasts later Sunday was Sri Lanka’s deadliest violence in a decade. Wijewardene said the death toll from the attack now stood at 321 people, with 500 wounded.\nIn some places, the violence struck entire families. On Easter Sunday, as they did every Sunday, Berlington Joseph Gomez and his wife, Chandrika Arumugam, went to church at Colombo’s St. Anthony’s Shrine. And as always, they brought their three sons: 9-year-old Bevon, 6-year-old Clavon and baby Avon, just 11 months old.\nTwo days later, they were all being mourned by dozens of neighbours gathered at the modest home of Berlington’s father, Joseph Gomez.\n“All family, all generation, is lost,” Gomez said.\nWord from international intelligence agencies that a local group was planning attacks apparently didn’t reach the prime minister’s office until after the massacre, exposing the continuing political turmoil in the highest levels of the Sri Lankan government.\nOn April 11, Priyalal Disanayaka, Sri Lanka’s deputy inspector general of police, signed a letter addressed to the directors of four Sri Lankan security agencies, warning them that a local group was planning a suicide attack in the country.\nThe intelligence report attached to his letter, which has circulated widely on social media, named the group allegedly plotting the attack, National Towheed Jamaar, identifying its leader as Zahran Hashmi, and said it was targeting “some important churches” in a suicide terrorist attack that was planned to take place “shortly.”\nThe report named six individuals likely to be involved in the plot, including someone it said had been building support for Zahran and was in hiding since the group clashed with another religious organization in March 2018.\nOn Monday, Sri Lanka’s health minister held up a copy of the intelligence report while describing its contents, spurring questions about what Sri Lanka police had done to protect the public from an attack.\nIt was not immediately clear what steps were taken by any of these security directors. Disanayaka did not answer calls or messages seeking comment.\nAmong the 40 people arrested on suspicion of links to the bombings were the driver of a van allegedly used by the suicide attackers and the owner of a house where some of them lived.\nHeightened security was evident at an international airport outside the capital where security personnel walked explosive-sniffing dogs and checked car trunks and questioned drivers on roads nearby. Police also ordered that anyone leaving a parked car unattended on the street must put a note with their phone number on the windscreen, and postal workers were not accepting pre-wrapped parcels.\nA block on most social media since the attacks has left a vacuum of information, fueling confusion and giving little reassurance the danger had passed. Even after an overnight curfew was lifted, the streets of central Colombo were mostly deserted Tuesday and shops closed as armed soldiers stood guard.\nPrime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said he feared the massacre could unleash instability and he vowed to “vest all necessary powers with the defence forces” to act against those responsible.\nAuthorities said they knew where the group trained and had safe houses, but did not identify any of the seven suicide bombers, whose bodies were recovered, or the other suspects taken into custody. All seven bombers were Sri Lankans, but authorities said they strongly suspected foreign links.\nLater Tuesday, the Islamic State group claimed responsibility for the Sri Lanka attack via its Aamaq news agency, but offered no photographs or videos of attackers pledging their loyalty to the group. Such material, often showing suicide bombers pledging loyalty before their assaults, offer credibility to their claims.\nThe group, which has lost all the territory it once held in Iraq and Syria, has made a series of unsupported claims of responsibility. It recently offered its first claim of an attack in Congo.\nAlso unclear in Sunday’s attack was the motive. The history of Buddhist-majority Sri Lanka, a country of 21 million including large Hindu, Muslim and Christian minorities, is rife with ethnic and sectarian conflict.\nIn the nation’s 26-year civil war, the Tamil Tigers, a powerful rebel army known for using suicide bombers, had little history of targeting Christians and was crushed by the government in 2009. Anti-Muslim bigotry fed by Buddhist nationalists has swept the country recently.\nIn March 2018, Buddhist mobs ransacked businesses and set houses on fire in Muslim neighbourhoods around Kandy, a city in central Sri Lanka that is popular with tourists.\nAfter the mob attacks, Sri Lanka’s government also blocked some social media sites, hoping to slow the spread of false information or threats that could incite more violence.\nSri Lanka, though, has no history of Islamic militancy. Its small Christian community has seen only scattered incidents of harassment.\nAssociated Press journalists Bharatha Mallawarachi, Jon Gambrell and Rishabh Jain in Colombo and Gemunu Amarasinghe in Negombo, Sri Lanka, contributed to this report.\nEmily Schmall And Krishan Francis, The Associated Press", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

{"id": "6401", "text": "How Hard Is Tiling a Bathroom?\nHow Hard Is Tiling a Bathroom?\nHave you ever considered doing the tile in your bathroom? If so you may have wondered just how difficult it may be to do the job on your one from start to finish. It can honestly be a tough decision to make, especially if you are not handy with tools. There are lots of factors to consider and you will need to look out for obstacles that can make “doing it yourself” a disaster.\nTo help make your decision easier, we have done the work to create a guide listing the pros and cons of doing your bathroom tiles yourself. We think that this information will allow you to make an informed decision. After you read through this guide you will know how hard it is to tile a bathroom and learn how to tile a bathroom yourself properly. Once you have this knowledge you will be ready to transform your bathroom into your dream space.\nAdvantages of a Tiler\nThere are many advantages of having a professional bathroom tiler. Naturally, most homeowners will turn to a professional for a streamlined and stress-free experience. A professional bathroom tiler knows how to tile and retile a bathroom and can do the work with little to no issues. The most significant advantages of hiring a professional include:\nThere is no denying that the easiest way to transform your bathroom is by hiring a professional. It is by far the biggest advantage of not doing the work yourself. By hiring a professional bathroom tiler you can cut out doing the research for things like “Is laying tile hard?” or “Is tiling a shower difficult?” and just leave the heavy lifting to them. Your tiler will likely have done hundreds of bathroom remodels so they will be able to help you determine the exact materials and methods needed for your bathroom.\nA professional bathroom tiler can also assist with helping you make bigger decisions such as the best shade of grout to use or which shape tile will create the most vivid result in the space. Hiring a professional will make it easier for you to enjoy the transformation process and get the proper input needed to make your remodel a success.\nPeace of Mind\nHaving a professional bathroom tiler working in your home means you can (and should) expect a professional result. The finished product should reflect the skill and time of your chosen contractor. A knowledgeable bathroom tiler helps you avoid making many of the mistakes you may have encountered while trying to get through the process solo.\nAnother way that professional bathroom tilers make the process easier includes eliminating dangerous installation mistakes. Your tiler knows how hard it is to retile a bathroom so they can make sure your space gets the attention it deserves. Lastly a professional takes you out of harm’s way and allows you to have a stress-free transformation process.\nDo you want to renovate your bathroom and need knowledge of tiling for shower floor tiles? That’s the exact point where the issue of “knowledge and professionalism” comes in. The expertise of a professional bathroom tiler comes from having first-hand industry knowledge. This is beneficial because they can help you achieve your desired aesthetic, while also recommending techniques and products. Their knowledge will make it easier to get a custom result and add unique features.\nYou can also look forward to knowing that your bathroom tiler is using good-quality materials and tools. This is another way you can be assured that your remodel is being done right. You doing the work yourself may not get you the long-lasting outcome you desire. Professional help is a great way to get your new bathroom completed without all the hassle.\nDon’t hesitate to use our best-quality wholesale tiles for your next project, a good tiler and high-quality tiles can totally change your home atmosphere and level up your decoration game!\nDisadvantages of a Tiler\nThere are also disadvantages to hiring a tiler. However, these issues aren’t always avoidable if you need a professional to complete your bathroom retile.\nYour bathroom tiler can start your remodel at whichever time they choose. So you will be expected to work with them on a timeframe. You should be able to expect a professional to do the job faster than a DIY which may not always be the case.\nThe costs associated with hiring a professional bathroom tiler are by far the biggest disadvantage according to most homeowners. You will be expected to pay for the cost of materials and labor, which are not cheap. If you have a larger bathroom you can expect to pay substantially more to have professionals remodel your space. It’s best to shop around and get recommendations from others before deciding on a contractor.\nAdvantages of DIY\nYou Gain a New Skill\nLearning how to tile a bathroom yourself is a great way to gain a set of skills. These things can be used to do additional projects around the home and are skills you can keep for the rest of your life. Learning how to retile a bathroom can also help you help others.\nLearning how to cut out the middleman to get the job done is a huge advantage. Cutting the cost of a professional bathroom tiler is one of the best advantages for DIY-ers. Do-it-yourself tiling means you can only pay for the materials you need and move at your own pace to complete your bathroom transformation.\nDisadvantages of DIY\nWhile do-it-yourself tiling can be a great way to cut costs you need to know that there are possible downsides. If you are not doing the proper research you can run into many things that can go wrong. These missteps can potentially be detrimental to the process of causing issues further down the line. The following are some important disadvantages to avoid which include:\nLack of Experience\nA lack of experience can be very costly if you decide to DIY retile your bathroom. An experienced DIYer may not have many issues getting the job done, but a novice DIYer may not have it so easy. A DIYer who is not used to taking on large projects may find it daunting and difficult. If you are not dedicated to learning how hard it is to retile a bathroom, you may not be ready to take on the work yourself.\nThe worst possible outcome to DIY bathroom tiling is that things don’t go as planned and you need to have professionals come in to correct issues. You also want to avoid serious injury so make sure you are considering all the pros and cons to retiling your bathroom and that you understand that tiling in showers may be difficult.

{"id": "6466", "text": "This is not a column about school spirit. I know that the majority of Richmond students are proud to be Spiders, because if we weren't, then we would have transferred by now.\nWe have some of the most architecturally beautiful buildings on campus, state-of-the-art facilities for academics and student life and, of course, plenty of schoolwork to keep us busy.\nBut I thought that more people would have showed up for a gorgeous fall afternoon of football.\nI know midterms are upon us, and sometimes that comfy chair in Boatwright is hard to get out of (or, if you can leave the chair, it's only for a double-shot espresso mocha Frappuccino from 8:15). We, as students, are inundated with tons of papers to write, articles to read, films to watch, labs to test, paintings to paint, spreadsheets to compute and more.\nBut don't you think you deserve a break from it all?\nA few hours spent absorbing some much-needed vitamin D from the sun and fresh air (if you spend too long in Boatwright, you forget what fresh air smells like because the fresh air in that little courtyard on B-1 is more nicotine-filled than oxygen-filled) can do the body and mind good. Also, Saturday was one of the finest fall days thus far: no 90-plus degree heat, humidity was low and there was a pleasant breeze. What's not to love?\nThe culture of our campus is not one that would be featured on ESPN College Game Day, and I've spent the past four years realizing that. When David Anderton, RC '76, called the student section \"a self-absorbed and over-indulged group of apathetic human beings,\" I knew he was wrong.\nStudents today probably have a lot more work than many of Anderton's classmates did in the 1970s because of the university's ever-present need to rank among the best. Students today probably are involved in a lot more activities than many of Anderton's classmates were in the '70s because of a larger student body and the mental complex of many students to do everything and anything.\nSo there was a poor student showing in the student section on Family Weekend. So what? The game was at an awkward time when many families had dinner reservations and other obligations. Also, because of poor planning, many students' families were not able to get tickets to the game. It was a fluke, and I don't think that the lack of students caused the Spiders to get trumped by Delaware.\nWith all of the hullabaloo swirling around Anderton's poorly written letter, I imagined more students would have turned out for the Coastal Carolina game last Saturday. We can yammer all day about the lack of student attendance, but really, what's the point?\nFor those students who were studying and working on their midterms: Good for you! I hope that crucial three-hour block of time on a Saturday afternoon spent in the library or wherever you happened to be went to good use. But you missed out on a remarkable fourth quarter of Richmond football.\nI know this week is going to be tough for many, but I hope you will realize that you really can spare three (or two-and-a-half, if the Spiders have a huge lead, as we did against Coastal Carolina) hours when there is a home game. We only have six this season, and three are over, so plan accordingly.\nEnjoy what you're reading?\nSignup for our newsletter\nIt's all about choices. Personally, I chose to go to the game because, quite frankly, I did not have anything else better to do on a beautiful afternoon. Also, I have a strong aversion to stepping foot in the library or any other study space on a Saturday.(It's just one of my idiosyncrasies.) The game was over by 4 p.m., and I was back at my apartment by 4:30 p.m. (and I'm a slow walker). There was still plenty of time to attempt some homework before the night's festivities began.\nYou can choose not to go to the game; that's fine with me. No one can make people go. But I wonder how much work I would complete if I spent a Saturday in the library.\nI am sure that there will be a massive turnout for the Homecoming game against Towson University, but that's to be expected. Will there be another large turnout for the following week's game against CAA-rival James Madison University? I would hope so, but I'm not letting Vegas take my bet.\nIt's hard to predict the cyclical effects of the \"work wave\" that swamps students every few weeks at Richmond. I wish professors would realize their planning of tests, quizzes, papers, labs, etc. would adversely affect students' free time during a home game weekend, but then again, we're here to learn, not to be drunk and obnoxious fans at a giant state school.\nTo Anderton, I challenge you to switch places with a current Richmond student during a week of a home game (and perhaps you can try to do five midterms at the same time, just for funzies). I'm sure you will see that the current Spider has a lot more obligations, organizations and just plain homework than you did back in 1976.\nTo all of the current students, I understand the amount of work we have is sometimes impossible to complete on a Sunday (especially if you are still feeling the effects from the night before). But, there are three home games left. The schedule is available online. Get out your planner, and if you have a paper due the Monday after the game? Then don't go. But if you have nothing else better to do?

Some people use sandpaper as well, but I strongly recommend a stone.\n- Cleaning brush: You’ll need a cleaning brush to remove stray hairs, dirt, and other debris from the blades. I suggest using an old toothbrush instead of any special clipper brush as it’s way better at cleaning as it’s stiff.\n- Marker: Sharpening the blades on a stone can take a few millimeters off the blades surface area. A marker comes handy to keep track of this loss.\n- Microfiber cloth: A microfiber cloth helps thoroughly clean the specks of stone from your blades after the sharpening process.\n- Clipper oil: This is also an essential part of the sharpening process as it keeps blades functioning well.\nAfter you’ve gathered all these items, it’s time to get to work. Here’s how to sharpen hair clipper blades at home.\nTable of Contents\nHow To Sharpen Hair Clipper Blades\nStep 1: Unscrew Hair Clippers\nThe first step to sharpen hair clipper blades is to unscrew the blades from the body of the clippers.\nDoing so makes it easier to clean them. However, not all clipper blades are detachable.\nYou can look at your clippers where the blades are fixed to the body. There will be two screws attaching the blades.\nWhat you need to do is remove these screws with the help of a screwdriver.\n- Make a note of how the clippers are joined to the blades (positioning, etc.) as this makes reassembly easier.\n- If you have difficulty removing the blades, pull them out using a pair of tweezers after you remove the screws.\nStep 2: Clean Hair Clippers\nSometimes, when you’re not getting a good enough shave, the problem isn’t the blades.\nI’ve found that a number of times, there is just dirt and stray hairs trapped in the clippers that prevent a clean shave.\nSo it’s good to try to clean out the clippers before you get to sharpening hair clipper blades.\nBrush Out Dirt\nThe first thing you need to do to clean your clippers is to brush away any remains of hair or dust trapped between the blades.\nI personally use a stiff, old toothbrush as it gives a better clean. But you can also use steel wool or toothpicks more stubborn or hard-to-reach dirt.\nSome blades might accumulate rust if you’ve been using them in the shower or leaving them near a high moisture area.\nThese can still be reused. You just need to clean them with a good blade wash.\nIf you don’t have a beard wash handy, you can also use isopropyl alcohol. Just make sure the solution is the strong, 90% isopropyl alcohol. Anything less won’t remove the rust as well.\nDry and Test the Blades\nThe next step is to dry the blades thoroughly using a microfiber cloth. If you’re satisfied with the blades, you can test them to see if they work well.\nIf you still find rust on the blades, it might be time to replace them.\nTo test the blades you can run them on a small patch of hair. If the clippers are still dull or snag at your hair, it might need more than a cleaning.\nHowever, most self-sharpening blades need only be cleaned. And it rarely requires manual sharpening at your end.\nSharpening Hair Clippers\nIf you still find that cleaning hasn’t helped or if you’re using a regular variety of clippers that are not self-sharpening, it’s time to sharpen hair clipper blades by yourself.\nHere’s how you go about it.\nStep 3: Run Blades Across Honing Stone\nNow for the magic to happen!\nBefore you get to sharpening, mark the interior sides of the clipper blades with your marker. This will make it easier to see how much surface area you’ve shaved off while sharpening.\n- Do not use your hands while sharpening the blades on the stone, you might hurt yourself.\n- You can use a magnet holder and place the end of the blades in the middle with the sharp side extending outwards.\nAs I’ve mentioned before you need a honing stone or sharpening stone or whetstone in 3000 grits and 8000 grits. You can easily find these stones in any hardware store.\nThe second one is a finer stone and is optional. But I find it very useful to give your blades a fine edge.\nYou need to first run the blade at a 30-45 degree angle over the whetstone in only ONE direction till the blades appear shiny and sharp.\nKeep running the blade forward for at least 5-10 times. Next, turn the blade over and repeat the same procedure. Then, wipe off the stone debris with a cloth.\nYou can leave it at that or use a 8000 grit whetstone and repeat the same procedure 5-10 times for better results.\nWord of caution: You shouldn’t be using a sharpening stone made of ceramic on ceramic blades as this can destroy them. Use a diamond sharpening stone instead. Be careful while buying whetstone and do not confuse sharpening stones “for” ceramic blades with stones “made of” ceramic.\nStep 4: Screw Hair Clipper Blades Back Into Place\nNow that you’ve sharpened the hair clipper blades, it’s time to screw them back into their original place.\nI usually wipe off any stone residue with a microfiber cloth before putting them back together.\nWhen you’re screwing the blades back into position make sure you assemble them the right way up.\nAlso, make sure they are the same distance apart from the clipper as they originally were. Use a screwdriver to tighten the screws so there is no chance of them coming apart.\nStep 5: Use Hair Clipper Oil\nUsing a hair clipper oil is recommended even if you’re not sharpening your blades.\nYou need to apply this oil to your clippers after every 3-4 uses. This oil keeps the blades functioning smoothly and reduces friction and overheating.\nBut hair clipper oil is very essential right after sharpening. Just 2-3 drops of this oil should be enough.\nI always use a lightweight oil that can penetrate easily between the blades. Darker, heavier oils seem to clog the blades more than helping them move.\nIt’s best to ask your barber for options on hair clipper oils before making a purchase.\nStep 6: Run Hair Clippers For Some Time\nThe last step is to run the clippers for a few minutes. No, this is not just for testing the blades if they work properly.\nRunning the blades this way hones them better and allows the oils to penetrate as well.\nAfter all this, your hair clippers are fully sharpened and ready to use. All that’s left is to try them out on a patch of hair and see if you’re satisfied with the results.\nFAQs on how to sharpen hair clipper blades\n#1 – How many times can you sharpen clipper blades?\nA bit of the surface area of the blades gets shaved off every time you sharpen it. So you can probably sharpen clipper blades just two or three times in their lifetime.\nYes, sharpen them for more times than that is technically possible. But it makes your balde width smaller and hampers the shaving process.\n#2 – How do I know if my clipper blades are dull?\nThe easiest way to know if your clipper blades are dull is to see how your skin feels during and after a shave.\nIf you find that a few stray hairs remain and that the clippers haven’t got all the hair or that they have left the strands coarse and blunt, it might be time for a sharpening.\nClipper blades that are dull will also tug and pull at your skin when you are using them.\n#3 – Can you use sandpaper to sharpen clipper blades?\nYes, you can use sandpaper to sharpen clipper blades. But it’s not as quick as using a whetstone.\nAlso there is no guarantee that you’ll get sharp, fine edged blades after using a sandpaper. With a whetstone, all you need to do is scrape them across a few times and you are all set. Sandpaper requires a lot of work.\nTo use sandpaper to sharpen clipper blades you need to place the blades on a flat surface and then rub the sandpaper over them in a back and forth motion.\nAnd that was how to sharpen hair clipper blades at home. I hope you found this article informative.\nI suggest giving your hair clipper blades a shave 3-4 months if you use it quite often. Or a good sharpening every six months also works.", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}
{"id": "6488", "text": "The introduction of the SDLT anti-avoidance rule in section 75A of the Finance Act 2003 in December 2006, caused much unwelcome consternation and uncertainty. Essentially, s75A seeks to replace actual transactions with a notional transaction and impose SDLT on the highest amount of consideration payable for any of the actual transactions. HMRC published guidance (in November 2010) which sought to clarify and narrow the scope of the rules. Nearly 13 years on, there is still a lack of clarity and as such, evolving case law is read with much interest.\nThe first case on s75A was Project Blue Ltd v HMRC . The case involved the use of a sub-sale and leaseback arrangement designed to take advantage of sub-sale relief and the Islamic financing exemption. HMRC won this case, but there was much postulation and variations of opinions in the case at all appeal levels. The case eventually found its way to the Supreme Court. Key points coming out of this decision centred around the acknowledgement that the rules were deliberately drafted widely, to catch a wide range of transactions and the realisation that there did not need to be a tax avoidance motive for s75A to apply, despite the section in the legislation being headed “anti-avoidance”.\nIn the recent case of Hannover Leasing Wachstumswerte Europa Beteiligungsgesellschaft MbH and another v HMRC , there was a pre-sale reorganisation involving the distribution of the property from a partnership to its limited partner, a Guernsey Property Unit Trust (GPUT). This was followed by a sale of the units in the GPUT and then a post-acquisition restructuring to move the property to another vehicle. Where there is a transfer of shares which is the first of a series of transactions, this is ignored for the purposes of s75A. This allows buyers to acquire shares in a company or units in a unit trust and extract the property from that company or unit trust. In Hannover, because the first transaction was a transfer of the property and not a transfer of shares, all of the transactions could be considered under s75A and SDLT levied on the consideration paid for the units in the GPUT. The Tribunal also confirmed that there did not need to be a tax avoidance motive for s75A apply. This is contrary to HMRC’s manual, which states that in their view, s75A should only apply where there is tax avoidance. The Tribunal stated that s75A self-defined the kind of tax avoidance that was within its scope. HMRC has not yet updated its guidance in light of the Project Blue and Hannover decisions, but has said that it is currently under review.\nThe Hannover decision came as a surprise to practitioners and taxpayers, as HMRC has long accepted that share or unit sales were not subject to SDLT. This may prompt reconsideration of the SDLT position and potential SDLT liability on legacy transactions, which have involved some kind of pre-sale reorganisation. On the positive side, the judgement does provide some signposts as to how to structure transactions in a way that means s75A will not apply and the Tribunal indicated that had the steps here been implemented in a different order, there would have been no SDLT charge.\nShould you wish to discuss any tax related real estate exposure, please contact Richard on 020 3794 4518 or email at email@example.com.", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}
{"id": "6527", "text": "Europe may be just around the corner but with so much variety in culture arts and stunning monuments you’d be remiss not to visit it as often as possible. Despite the weight of the Euro against the Pound travel to Europe is still not very expensive and if you pick up a cheap package or flights and hotels you won’t be speeding a huge amount more than you do at home anyway. With that in mind we have put together a list of the top 5 city breaks in Europe. So grab yourself some travel insurance, a cheap flight and a hotel and get going.\nThe city of love lives up to its name time and time again as it remains one of the absolute gems of Western Europe. With its relaxed café culture, awe inspiring monuments, fine art and fine cuisine Paris has a little of something for everyone. The Eiffel Tower, Notre Damme and the Louvre are of course the most well-known of all the Parisian delights but they are by no means the totality of all there is to do or see. Even if you have “done” most of the tourist sites there’s still the shopping, the food, the jazz bars, the cafes and some fantastic sites around Paris.\nThe capital of Estonia might not seem like an ideal and beautiful location but it really is one of the best hidden gems of Europe. The city has become incredibly popular as a night life spot since Ibiza and Greece have become more expensive. However this isn’t even part of what Tallinn has to offer. The city is like a fairy tale dream brought to life. The towering castles/spires are so idyllic it’s hard to describe them. Highlights have to be the Sinewy spire of the town hall, the Alexander Nevsky Cathedral and Kadriorg Palace. Tallinn is unlike even most of the rest of the former USSR so is absolutely worth an extended visit.\nDespite being a relatively small capital city Prague really has a fantastic amount to see and do. The Charles Bridge and Prague castle are the most famous sites to see but Prague has tons more to see and do. The river is beautiful and the parks are fantastic to wander aimlessly around for hours. And that’s not even beginning to mention the food, the beer and the stunning architecture lining every street and alley.\nBarcelona has long been considered one of the cultural capitals of the world thanks to its fine arts, laissez faire café culture and fantastic climate. Barcelona has a great mixture of Catalan and Spanish culture and some of the finest architecture in Spain. Highlights for Barcelona have to be the Seu cathedral, the national palace, the magic fountain, beautiful parks and of course the winding Ramblas. The Ramblas show off Barcelona’s culture at its finest and are well worth wandering around to your hearts- and feet’s – content.\nBudapest just had to be number one for us. The city is beautiful in a way that Paris and our other entries just don’t quite manage to be. It has the architecture, the arts, the stunning rivers, the meandering streets and luscious parks but it also just has something more. The culture is unique which helps a lot and the baths and natural spring waters are just beautifully relaxing. Maybe that’s what manages to give the city it’s relaxed and tranquil feel and makes it one of the most peaceful cities in Europe. For a city break Budapest really gives you the best of everything.\nMike is a travel writer for sites such as ColumbusDirect.com, covering worldwide destinations, budget travel and tips on how to find the best deals for your holiday.", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}
{"id": "6528", "text": "This winter has been a miserable one, the coldest and snowiest ever since I moved here 11 years ago. Over the years, I've lost some of my Canadian hardiness in regards to cold weather. Maybe I should go back home to Sudbury and sit out on Lake Wanapitei for a weekend of ice fishing to get my Canadian cred back. There have been times when I started bitching about temps being in the 20s this winter. But this is life in Northeastern Ohio as weather can be unpredictable. One day it will be 60F and two days later there's 2' of snow. I remember one April, I was fishing in a t-shirt as it was 70F and four days later I was completely covered in snow. Earlier in the week we received some rain and it raised the streams and muddy the waters. I was pissed that the Grand went up as I was hoping to do a float down it.\nWith the weather being a drag, so has work. I'm tired of sitting in the back getting drunk on coffee and having the office throw me a bone or two. The number of jobs this year has been few and far between. This past Friday, I spent the entire day in the garage shooting the shit with Bob the warehouse manager. We were detailing a work truck that involved wiping the dash and taking 30 minute coffee breaks, then washing the bed and taking another extended coffee break. We made it an all day event and I took all of KC's change in the cup holder for services rendered. The weather on Friday was not the best as the wind was terrible and the temperature barely got above 32F. If it was warmer, I would of came down with the 24 steelhead flu and blow the day off.\nThe day finally ended and I spent the evening going through the annoying task of tying sacs. I talked to several people on what would be the game plan and it was another trip out east. As expected I checked 3 different weather reports and got 3 different results. It would be the roll of the dice as I headed out early and was the designated guinea pig. I arrived to see the river slushy as expected and I made the best of it for the time being. I received the calls and told them \"take your time\". The morning was sunny and this late in the winter the sun is strong enough to burn off the slush in matter of hours...........wrong. The skies clouded over and the crew arrived to challenging conditions. Before the crew showed up I managed to land 5 fish, but the fishing was tough and I was concerned that the slush wouldn't burn off until afternoon. Sure enough the slush disappeared around noon and we started to hook into a lot of fish.\nAs I've mentioned before about Murphy's Law #6 ( catch a hog and you forgot your camera ) and that applied this afternoon as I hooked into a monster hen. As soon as the fish boiled at the surface, Don said it was a huge fish. Sure enough I caught a glimpse of it and it was the fattest looking pig I've ever seen. I managed to get it to the bank and she had a gut that would make King Kong Bundy proud. She wasn't long but she had a ton of eggs. One of Don's friends had a scale and she weighed in at 12lbs. Luckily, Don brought his camera and took a couple of money shots. Too bad Bubba left earlier because he could of cashed in his hen for this one as he was literally scrapping the bottom of his egg jar today.\nTaking the day off tomorrow as another clipper is moving through and the temps won't make it out of the 20s. Many of the rivers are still off color, but the flow is great and there are many fresh fish to be had.", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}
{"id": "6534", "text": "Nestled in the beautiful countryside of northern Virginia lies a hidden gem. Lake Anna is one of the largest freshwater lakes in the state, and its size and convenient location make it an excellent vacation destination. Whether you prefer a lazy beach vacation or a high-energy adventure, these Lake Anna vacation rentals and activities have something for everyone in your family.\n1. Go Prospecting\nProspectors once flocked to this part of Virginia in search of the precious metals and gems hidden in these hills. While you’re not likely to strike it rich, Lake Anna State Park offers plenty of opportunities for prospecting. The visitor’s center has an authentic, old-fashioned sluice where you can search for flakes of gold hidden in the silt and water during a quick visit. During the summer months, longer gold panning and prospecting classes are held regularly. These classes offer a fun opportunity for older kids to learn about history and geology.\n2. Cast a Line\nAs a thriving freshwater lake, Lake Anna and the surrounding waterways are home to plentiful bass, bream, catfish, and more. Anyone with a valid Virginia fishing license can cast a line from the shore or a boat. If you can’t bring your own rods, several local businesses offer them for rent. Choose a daily rental if your schedule is otherwise full, or consider renting them by the week and storing them in your vacation rental garage to save money. There is also a small, accessible two-acre pond located near the park’s visitor center for young anglers or people with disabilities.\n3. Hit the Trail\nSee nature up close by exploring Lake Anna State Park’s network of trails. The system includes 11 trails covering more than 15 miles, and most of them are suitable for kids of all ages. Keep your eyes peeled for deer, river otters, turtles, and beavers as you hike. These trails are also a haven for birdwatchers, with blue herons, ospreys, and numerous other species populating the park. If you want a more strenuous workout, choose the Pigeon Run, Big Woods, or Gold Hill routes.\n4. Relax on the Beach\nLake Anna State Park is home to one of the area’s most beautiful beaches. Build a sandcastle up close to the water, or set up a portable shelter further back on the grassy meadow surrounding the beach. Lifeguards are posted from Memorial Day weekend to Labor Day weekend so your kids are safe as they splash and swim. A concession stands serving ice cream and other treats are also available during the summer months.\n5. Ride a Rollercoaster\nIf you’re in the mood for a thrill, head a little less than an hour south to Kings Dominion. This popular theme park features rides and attractions for all ages, ranging from carousels and kids’ rides to gravity-defying rollercoasters. Cool down on the Shenandoah Lumber Company log flume ride, or get a bird’s eye view on the Americana Ferris wheel. Kings Dominion is typically open from late March to early September, although hours may be limited early or late in the season.\n6. Paddle Out for Adventure\nGet a workout and explore the environment by renting a canoe or kayak. Lake Anna has more than 200 miles of coastline to explore, so consider renting for multiple days and storing your gear in your vacation rental’s garage or porch. Venture out on your own, or take one of Lake Anna State Park’s frequent canoe tours to learn more about the area.\n7. Go Waterskiing\nIf you want to hit the water but prefer a more adrenaline-fueled experience, consider waterskiing as an alternative. Lake Anna offers plenty of quiet, uncrowded inlets with a smooth surface and enough room to get up to speed. The water can get a bit chilly in the spring and fall, but the waterskiing season typically lasts from April to October. There are also plenty of equipment rentals, boat launches, and marinas to choose from.\n8. Enjoy a Historical Tour\nLake Anna and Spotsylvania County are rich in history. Take a tour of the old gold mine in Lake Anna State Park, or head into Spotsylvania to visit the historic courthouse and take a tour of the site of one of the biggest battles of the Civil War. If you prefer a self-guided route, stop in at the Spotsylvania Museum for a brochure that guides you along a walking tour of the town’s historic district. Although these tours are not strenuous, they may be better suited for older children.\n9. Discover the Wonders of Nature\nCheck out Lake Anna State Park’s calendar to discover upcoming nature and wildlife classes. These frequently offered workshops teach kids about everything from animal behavior to botany and conservation. Hands-on courses offer an immersive experience for younger kids, while guided nature walks or canoe tours let older kids have an adventure. Even if you don’t take a class, keep an eye out for the park’s Roving Rangers, who often visit the beach with native wildlife or other educational displays.\n10. Hunt for Hidden Geocaches\nIf you still have a hankering for treasure hunting after experimenting with prospecting, consider going geocaching. This high-tech scavenger hunt not only lets you explore the woods and find hidden treasures, but it also teaches kids valuable navigation and orienteering skills. Lake Anna’s shores are a popular destination for geocachers, and the park offers beginner’s workshops to help get you started if you’re new to the activity.", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}

As the rain came down on the Kingston Campus, President Marc Parlange offered some encouragement to the hardy ceremony attendees.\n“It is a pleasure to join you here today,” Parlange said. “Look at all of you. You are extraordinary.” Acknowledging the rainy conditions and the persistence of those in attendance with a bit of humor, the president said, “The Swiftie fans at Gillette Stadium have no problem and neither do we.”\nThe University conferred degrees on 3,331 undergraduate students Saturday and 769 graduate students Friday, from nearly every U.S. state and 31 countries.\nDespite gray skies and rain, the historic Quadrangle was full of color as banners and flags waved in the breeze and graduates, faculty, administrators and family members carried umbrellas displaying every color of the rainbow. As graduates processed to their seats, they smiled and shouted out joyful greetings to family and friends.\n“When I look out across the quad today, I see scholars, parents, family, and, most importantly, friends. You are a vibrant community built on relationships and partnerships that will last long after you leave here today,” Parlange said. “Once you’re a Rhody Ram, you’re a member of the Rhody Fam for life–and that family reaches every corner of the world and is there to help and support you.”\nKeynote speaker Terry Tempest Williams, writer, naturalist and freedom-of-speech advocate, was also conferred an honorary doctorate of humane letters. In preparing her speech, she said she had the joy of meeting with 12 graduating seniors.\nAcknowledging the conditions, she said, “Where I come from in the American Southwest, rain is a blessing. Let us receive it as such.”\nOf speaking with students, she said, “I asked you, what do you need to hear? This is what I heard: That uncertainty is okay. That we have a future. That what we learned in four years of college was important. That we have a responsibility to give something back to society with the skills we have developed in college,” Williams said.\n“I want the world to stay as it is, one of you said. I am not satisfied with the world as it is, another of you replied. With racial injustices, environmental degradation, and gun violence, do we work within unjust systems or do we work outside of them?”\nOthers told Williams, “I want to hear how we take down the old structures and build something new, more inclusive, real, and creative. I need permission to break free. Encourage us to do what we love – to follow our hearts into our passions.”\n2023 Commencement Weekend\nThe University conferred degrees on 3,331 undergraduate students and 769 graduate students over Commencement Weekend, from nearly every U.S. state and more than 30 countries.\nIn closing, she said, “What I want you to know is this: When I listened to you, when I heard you, there were two questions that come to mind: One, how can we help? And two, will you help me? These two questions, when they meet each other, define community.\n“What I can tell you is this. You do have a future and it is yours to correct with the gifts that are ours. Congratulations. How can we help? We need you,” she said.\nIn addition to Williams, the University conferred honorary degrees upon Zaven Khachaturian, widely recognized as the “father” of modern Alzheimer’s disease research and mentor to countless researchers; Wendy Schmidt, a philanthropist and investor who has spent nearly two decades creating innovative, non-profit organizations to work with communities around the world for clean, renewable energy, resilient food systems, healthy oceans and the protection of human rights; and Clint Smith, an interdisciplinary scholar and inspirational social justice educator, poet, author and renowned speaker.\nThe undergraduate student speaker, Mazen Taman of Cranston, Rhode Island, who earned a Doctor of Pharmacy degree, played football for the Rhody Rams for four years. He told the audience that his family came to the United States from Egypt before he and his siblings were born.\n“I was raised in a one-parent household, where my mom worked tirelessly at multiple jobs and to keep my two brothers and me in school and sports,” Taman said. “My mother has been there every step of the way, offering endless support as I pursued my dreams. Today, I stand before you as a graduate of this esteemed university, and I know that this accomplishment would not have been possible without the unwavering love and encouragement of my mother. So, mom, look at us now–we made it. And to all the parents, guardians, friends and supporters who have helped us reach this point, we owe you a debt of gratitude that can never be repaid.”\nHe urged his fellow graduates to “wake up every day motivated to be a better person than you were the day before. Our opportunities are endless, but with each step you take, I challenge you to ask yourself, ‘What is my why?’ When you know the answer, make sure you never forget it.”\nA celebration of graduate students\nPresident Parlange said Friday night at the Ryan Center he hoped the graduates would take pride in their accomplishments and look back on their achievements with a deep sense of achievement.\n“In one respect, you are just starting your careers and your path from here will take you beyond our campuses and into your field of work,” the president said. “You are also beginning a lifetime of engagement with the University, entering into a vibrant community of alumni who are decision-makers and leaders, entrepreneurs, industry pioneers, and game-changers in every corner of the world. This community–your network of hundreds of thousands of alums–is a powerful asset that you can leverage for a lifetime. Stay connected, tap into it, give back to it, and use the resources it provides, which you have so richly deserved.”\nFriday’s ceremony also featured an address by graduate student speaker Tania Silva de Oliveira, who earned her Ph.D. in chemical engineering in December 2022 and is now employed at a Boston-based global pharmaceutical company. With her drive and the support of her family, she completed two bachelor’s degrees in her native Brazil and also completed an undergraduate study-abroad experience at URI.\n“I always felt and knew that education was the way toward a better life for me and for my family,” Oliveira said. “As an undergraduate, I went to a chemical engineering school, and like many of you, worked nights to pay my rent and bills and studied during the day.”\nTalking about her doctoral studies at URI, she acknowledged the common challenges faced by all grad students.\n“We all know that we fought, dedicated, and gave the best of ourselves to be sitting where we are today,” Oliveira said. “But graduate school is also rewarding, otherwise no one would pursue it. I still remember the feeling of having my first scientific paper published. I bet you do as well.”\nShe also told the audience that many family members were watching at home in Brazil.\n“And as you know, my mom and grandma are not understanding a single word of what I am saying. I will ask you to excuse me so I can offer them a few special words: Te amo vó e mãe! Obrigada por tudo,” meaning, I love you grandma and mom. Thank you for everything.\nWatch the Commencement 2023 ceremonies and recap videos and photos.", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

{"id": "6593", "text": "Explore and monitor how Economic Progress is affecting economies, industries and global issues\nGet involved with our crowdsourced digital platform to deliver impact at scale\nStay up to date:\nIn 1950, people in South Korea and Pakistan earned roughly the same amount of money annually. Today, the two countries are scarcely comparable. South Korean’s per capita income has grown 23-fold since then, while Pakistan has experienced only a three-fold increase.\nHow we can help more of the world’s poorest countries emulate South Korea’s success is one of the most important questions facing the world today. Better economic outcomes mean empowering entire populations with better health, more education, longer life, and less vulnerability to challenges like natural disasters.\nMany of the United Nations’ proposed 169 development targets for the next 15 years are, at their heart, concerned with poverty reduction. But not all targets are equally good. The Copenhagen Consensus Center, of which I am director, recently asked 60 teams of economists to evaluate the benefits and costs of these proposed targets, which will come into force to replace the Millennium Development Goals in September.\nOne of the least desirable targets seems laudable at first: full employment for all. Unfortunately, this is a dream, not a target. Economies need some unemployment to allow workers to change jobs, and most governments already focus on job creation. Research suggests that politicians and interest groups would use a full-employment target to support expensive, protectionist policies that generate great jobs for some but drive many into the informal economy. So it would probably end up doing less good than it would cost, and it is certainly not the way to reduce extreme poverty.\nAbout 14.5% of the world’s population, or one billion people, live on less than $1.25 a day. So why not end extreme poverty by simply transferring enough resources to this billion people to get them to at least $1.26 a day? The world’s poorest would be able to feed and educate their children better and become healthier.\nBut, in addition to the financial cost, there would be huge administrative challenges, along with corruption and institutional deficiencies. When these factors are weighed against the benefits in monetary terms, each dollar spent ending extreme poverty with cash transfers would achieve about $5 worth of social value. That is not a bad return at all, but there are many better ways to help.\nOne possibility is to triple mobile broadband penetration in developing countries. This would provide small-scale business people such as farmers and fishermen with market information, enabling them to sell their goods at the highest price – and to boost productivity, increase efficiency, and generate more jobs. Our research shows that the benefits, added up, would be worth $17 for every dollar spent – making it a very good development target.\nAn even better intervention addresses migration. More than 200 million people today work outside their home countries. As rich countries age, they need more workers. At the same time, people from developing countries are more productive in a developed country. Easing restrictions on migration would allow young people from developing countries to expand industrialized economies’ diminishing workforces – and generate the taxes needed to pay for care for the elderly.\nSuch migration would also be good for the developing countries, because migrant workers send home remittances. In total, every dollar spent on increased migration would produce more than $45 of social good – possibly more than $300. While in today’s political climate, increasing migration might be difficult to achieve, it is worth pointing out how effectively it could help the world’s poorest.\nThe single development target that would have the biggest impact on global prosperity would be the completion of the Doha trade round. Lowering trade barriers would mean that all countries could focus on doing what they do best, making everyone better off. Moreover, freer trade would accelerate economic growth, owing to increased innovation and knowledge exchange. Heavy reliance on trading in a global market was one of the main reasons that South Korea has developed so rapidly and essentially eradicated its poverty in the last 65 years.\nEconomic models indicate that a successful Doha round would make the global economy $11 trillion richer each year by 2030, with most of the benefits going to developing countries. Each person in the developing world would earn $1,000 more per year, on average. The number of people living in extreme poverty would fall by 160 million. For every dollar spent, mostly to pay off Western farmers blocking the current negotiations, the world would achieve more than $2,000 of benefits, making free trade a phenomenal investment.\nEach of these proposals – full employment, cash transfers, broadband rollout, freer migration, and lower trade barriers – is covered by at least one of the UN’s 169 development targets. And herein lies the problem.\nTrying to do 169 different things at once would be foolhardy. It would mean spending too much time and resources on lower-return priorities, instead of focusing on the targets that promise the biggest impact on the world’s poorest. In fact, our research shows that there are 19 phenomenal targets that – like freer trade – should be prioritized above all of the others.\nThe final decision about which targets will become global policy will affect the flow of trillions of dollars over the next 15 years. In September, when world leaders gather in New York, they need to focus on the smartest ways to boost global prosperity. Doing so would help more countries take South Korea’s path and lift their populations out of poverty.\nThis article is published in collaboration with Project Syndicate.

{"id": "6615", "text": "Windows Central Verdict\nThe Microsoft Presenter+ is an excellent peripheral for public speakers or team members who find themselves on stage (in person or virtually) in front of a PowerPoint presentation on a regular basis. With deep integration with Teams, it's a no brainer for managers and other roles that require presenting.\nSleek and discreet\nGood battery life\nCool virtual laser feature\nLimited amount of buttons\nCan't click on things with the laser\nMute button only works in Teams\nWhy you can trust Windows Central\nThese days, Microsoft is all about enhancing your workflow with handy productivity-focused software and accessories, and its new Presenter+ remote embodies that philosophy very much so. I love gadgets are that designed for specific use cases, and while it’s certainly not the first of its kind, the Presenter+ is elegant, sleek, and easy to set up and use.\nI've been using the Presenter+ for a little over two weeks to conduct presentations and enhance Teams meetings. Here's my review!\nMicrosoft Presenter+: Price & Availability\n|Header Cell - Column 0\n|3.7 x 1.16 x .37 in (93.86 x 29.5 x 9.4 mm)\n2.4GHz frequency range\n|.90 oz. 25.6g\n|195mAh (6 days)\n|Microsoft Teams button\n|In the box\nMicrosoft Presenter+: Design\nThe Presenter+ features a clean, elegant design that looks good on your desk and discreet in your hand. It's small, lightweight, and feels great to hold thanks to its premium smooth plastic enclosure. The buttons are tactile and easy to press and have a satisfying click to them.\nThe buttons themselves consist of a large circular mute button at the top, followed by two smaller left and right navigation buttons below it, a pill-shaped \"presenting laser\" button below those, and a large circular Teams button at the bottom. On the back are a power toggle and Bluetooth pair button.\nThe back of the remote is covered in a slightly grippy texture, which makes it slightly easier to hold and reduces its ability to slide around on your desk when not in the charging dock. There's also a small Microsoft logo on the back, just below an indented area to rest your finger in as you hold the device.\nOn the bottom is a USB-C port flanked by two silver prongs, used for charging with the included charging dock. The charging dock itself is a nice inclusion, connected to a USB-A cable that plugs into your computer to supply power. The USB-C port on the remote can also be used for charging.\nMicrosoft Presenter+: Features\nThe Presenter+ includes several different features and modes, all designed to enhance your experience when presenting PowerPoint presentations or partaking in Teams meetings. We'll start with the presentation features, which unsurprisingly are a highlight for this remote.\nThis remote includes a built-in virtual laser function, which can be used to point at and highlight areas of a screen being used to present content. The virtual laser can be used anywhere, in any app by simply holding the laser button and pointing at your screen.\nIt uses a built-in gyroscope to track the location of the remote, and relatively accurately display the laser where you'd expect it to be. It works very similarly to how LG's Magic Remote works on its TVs, with the ability to point the remote at the screen and use it as a mouse.\nThe laser button, when paired with the navigation buttons above it, makes for an all-in-one solution for presenting PowerPoint slides on a stage, or even virtually in Microsoft Teams. The only frustrating thing about the laser pointer is that you can't actually click on things with it. Within Windows, you can use it to highlight things, but if you want to click OK on a prompt, you can't.\nThe remote can also be used as a microphone toggle with the dedicated mute button along the top. This is great for scenarios where you might find yourself walking around a small office while in a meeting, with other colleagues interrupting you in person every so often.\nNow, there's no microphone built-in to the remote, so you can't use it as an on-the-go toggle mic, but the mute button will act as a toggle for whatever mic is built-in to the device you have it connected to.\nLastly, the Presenter+ features a vibration motor for tactile signals, which buzz when a Teams meeting starts, you mute or unmute your mic, when the battery is low, and even when you raise and lower your hand. Yes, the remote also functions as a way of raising your hand virtually in Teams meetings. Pretty cool.\nMicrosoft Presenter+: Customization\nMany of the functions and features of the Presenter+ remote can be configured, which means you can dial in how you want to use the remote to your personal taste. For example, you can choose to use the microphone button as a toggle, switching between muted and unmuted states with a click, or use it as a push-to-talk button, only unmuting the mic when the button is held down.\nThe laser feature can also be customized, including the ability to change the size and color of the laser pointer itself. You can also configure the sensitivity of the gyro, which is great if you find the remote isn't doing a good job of tracking the laser pointer on the screen out of the box.\nYou can even customize the strength of the tactility motor, increasing or decreasing its strength to suit your preference. You can also turn on and off which features present tactile signals, so if you didn't want it to vibrate when you mute or unmute your mic, you can turn that off.\nAll of these features can be customized using Microsoft's well-put-together Accessory Center app, which is automatically installed when you pair the remote to a Windows 10 or Windows 11 PC for the first time. The app also includes the ability to \"find my remote\" by buzzing the vibration motor inside it if you ever lose it.\nMicrosoft Presenter+: Competition\nThere are countless clicker devices out there on the market that allow you to control a PowerPoint presentation, and some of them even have actual laser point pointers built in. Peripherals such as the Logitech Presenter R400, which uses its own wireless receiver for functionality, can be had for just $32. But it doesn't come with any customization software or integration with Microsoft Teams.\nThere's also the DinoFire Wireless Presenter, which just like the Logitech, uses its own RF receiver for functionality, and a built-in level 2 laser. But again, no Microsoft Teams integration. And that's going to be the big differentiator between other clickers and the Microsoft Presenter+.\nThe Microsoft Presenter+ offers a virtual laser, in-depth Microsoft Teams integration, a wide array of customizable settings, and even a haptic motor. You're not going to find those things on other clickers on the market.\nMicrosoft Presenter+ Should you buy\nThe Microsoft Presenter+ is an excellent peripheral, but only if you find yourself presenting PowerPoint presentations on a regular basis. For everyone else, I don't think it's a necessary investment, as it's pretty easy to navigate a PowerPoint slide without a dedicated accessory.\nWith that said, the Presenter+ is really only for the people who want or need to look professional on a stage or virtually. They won't want to be seen walking back to a laptop on the corner of the stage to advance to the next slide. They want to stay in their flow and present the next slide as they talk to their audience.\nIf that's you, then you simply can't go wrong with the Presenter+. The other integrations with Teams are a nice addition, such as raising the remote to raise your hand in the meeting and using the mic button as a toggle.", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

The reasons which led the company to choose to make shafts that have the possibility of mounting sleeves entirely in aluminum, compared to the standard Anilox Sleeves (Inkers), are substantially for a reduction in the costs of purchasing and replacing sleeves, and an increase in precision, given the stiffness of a sleeve composed solely of a material such as aluminum, a reduction in environmental impact and disposal costs, avoiding the use of composite polymeric materials.\nAlready in the design phase, Zenit S.p.A. has set itself the constraint of using the same sleeve release method, using compressed air without removing the shaft from the machine, in such a way as to allow the user companies to avoid updates or changes later.\nThis project developed by Antonino Gasparini (Partner and Industrial Director) and Marco Solari (Mechanical Engineer and Designer), after tests and optimizations, has led to an excellent result, both in terms of cost and from the point of view of practical assembly and sleeve disassembly.\n\"This new type of Anilox inker, Patent n ° 0001429383, is the result of the skills and experience of Zenit S.p.A., together with advanced mechanical and IT support technologies, such as 5-axis machines and CAD / CAM software.\nIn addition to this important novelty, we are celebrating the 50th anniversary with many innovations, new machinery and new software, thanking all customers, suppliers and collaborators who have made it possible to achieve this coveted goal, concludes Marco Solari.", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}
{"id": "6659", "text": "From The preview of Ecological Questions journal\nThe fundamental task set by the editors of the journal is to bring together and present a diversity of research connected with ecology. Apart from the traditional ecological research areas, the scope of the journal will embrace more peripheral ecological issues connected with other disciplines of biology. Recognising the increasing importance of the humanities in ecological research, the editors will strive to give such issues due representation in the journal. We hope to encourage the researchers contributing to the journal to adopt an unconventional approach to solving ecological problems, to go beyond classical, well-established conceptions and to include methodological, and anthropological issues. Such an approach is validated by the intensive development of the sciences bordering on both biology and the humanities that has been observed over recent years.\nAs suggested by the title of the journal - Ecological Questions - we would like it to become a forum for an interdisciplinary debate which would raise difficult and controversial questions. As modern ecology abounds in such thorny issues, we offer publication opportunities to those who feel ready to respond to such challenges.", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}

{"id": "6689", "text": "Full of Heat\n“The combined scale of our geothermal cooperation projects in China is much larger than the entire heating system of Iceland,” revealed Ragnar Baldursson, a former Icelandic diplomat now serving as Marketing Director of Sinopec Green Energy Geothermal Development Co., Ltd. (hereinafter “Sinopec Green Energy”). “It is now the largest geothermal heating system in the world. This is what my country of only 360,000 people was able to contribute to the sustainable development of the world.”\nThe China-Iceland joint venture had been fully staffed in early 2020 to ensure a “warm winter” by providing clean geothermal energy for people in many places of China during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nEarthly Cycles Connecting Two Countries\nThe surface of the earth may often seem cold, but the planet has a warm heart. The inner temperature can reach as high as 7,000 degrees Celsius. Even places only 80 to 100 kilometers below the surface can be as hot as 1,200 degrees Celsius. Hot underground water can seep into the earth’s crust and eventually reach the surface. Geothermal energy is harnessed in places where hot underground water can be found less than five kilometers from the surface.\n“You must be able to dig wells to harness geothermal energy,” stressed Baldursson. “So, investment in the early phase has to be huge. China was not equipped to use this energy in the past.” Baldursson left Iceland for China in the 1970s and studied in Beijing. He always dreamed of helping with the heavy winter pollution from so many people burning coal for heat with technology from Iceland on geothermal heating.\nIceland is situated on volcanic rock. It is home to a wealth of geothermal energy, with the most hot springs in the world. “Even in the 1970s, Iceland’s heating system was already mostly powered by geothermal energy, so there is no pollution from winter heating.”\nHowever, he had no knowledge of the distribution of geothermal energy in China, which happens to also have rich geothermal energy resources, accounting for 7.9 percent of the world’s total. Some regions in China including Tibet are famous for plentiful high-temperature geothermal energy, and the rest of China has an even distribution of medium- and low-temperature geothermal energy.\nZhao Xin, Chief Financial Officer of Sinopec Green Energy, believes that China has the richest medium- and low-temperature geothermal energy in the world.\nEarthly cycles create clean and renewable energy as well as cooperation opportunities for China and Iceland. China Petrochemical Corporation (Sinopec Group) is committed to green and low-carbon development, while Arctic Green Energy Corporation is a cutting-edge provider of power and heating with geothermal energy. Their development strategies considerably overlap.\nAs a diplomat for Iceland, Baldursson eventually helped facilitate cooperation between the two nations in 2006. That year, the China-Iceland joint venture Sinopec Green Energy was founded in Xianyang City, Shaanxi Province.\nAround 2000, a giant “hot spring lake” emerged in southwestern Xiongxian County, Hebei Province. It was originally a small natural lake that was enlarged and warmed by diverted underground geothermal water.\nXiongxian is rich in geothermal energy, so many locals have long utilized geothermal energy for heating. The temperature of geothermal water there is very high, 60 to 80 degrees Celsius year-round. Institutions, communities, and individuals were all been digging to find heat. However, when they broke through to hot water, they lacked the technology to recycle the water back into the ground. So, much of the continuously running hot water ended up being diverted into the lake. The lake is warm and does not freeze during winter. Steam often hovers five to six meters above the surface.\nAs the underground water level dropped, many hot water wells stopped self-erupting, leaving many communities without hot water for heating. Gradually, the county realized that it wasn’t using its geothermal energy sustainably.\n“Without returning used water into the ground, geothermal energy risks exhaustion,” said Zhao.\nIn August 2009, Sinopec Green Energy began to cooperate with the local government to streamline and standardize the usage of geothermal energy and make the process sustainable with the company’s advanced technology.\n“We don’t stop after securing geothermal water,” noted Zhao. “We return used water into the ground according to an effective plan to ensure a general balance of resources. Get the heat and reinject the same year. This is one of the core technologies of our company.”\nBecause of technological and economic obstacles, many enterprises choose not to reinject. Some companies return the water to a different aquifer, which does not help the environment.\nSinopec Green Energy cooperated with the government of Xiongxian County to create the “Xiongxian Mode” featuring market operations, joint utilization, advanced technology, environmental friendliness, and benefits to the people. After years of effort, Xiongxian County has become the first smog-free town in northern China. Geothermal energy has powered over seven million square meters, 95 percent of the total heating areas in the county, eliminating the need to burn 650,000 tons of standard coal. The “Xiongxian Mode” has been widely recognized by the National Energy Administration of China and industry insiders. It was a highlight of China’s geothermal energy industry during the 12th Five-Year Plan Period (2011-2015) and has driven the rise of the industry during the 13th Five-Year Plan Period (2016-2020).\nAs an old Chinese saying goes, “paying back a loan on time makes it easier to borrow the next time.” This just conforms to the concept of sustainable usage of geothermal energy.\nBeautiful China: Opportunities for the World\n“We have cut carbon dioxide emissions by 7.5 million tons,” according to the website of Sinopec Green Energy.\n“Although the price of coal-fueled heating seems lower, it doesn’t include the cost of pollution.” Zhao added that due to proper design, the area can achieve energy self-sufficiency. Everything it needs is underground. After major investment in the initial stage, the subsequent cost of operation is very low.\nGeothermal heating projects by Sinopec Green Energy, a leading company in the industry, can be found in seven provinces in China. It has signed cooperation framework agreements with over 40 cities and towns, and projects have already been launched in over 30 of them. “The company plans to double its scale in the next five years,” stated Zhao. “This project transcends cooperation between companies. We’re working to promote the development of the entire industry.”\n“When I first arrived in China, the country was still exploring its own path for development, and the idea of sustainable development hadn’t been formed yet.” Since his first visit to China in the 1970s, Baldursson has witnessed the transformation of China’s development ideas. “When developed countries started calling for sustainable development and exploring renewable energy, China listened earnestly and acted quickly. And it ended up moving ahead of many of the staunchest advocates.”\n“Our cooperation demonstrates that during the process of China’s modernization, any country, big or small, can find areas for win-win cooperation with China based on their own natural endowment,” said Baldursson. “Many countries involved in the Belt and Road Initiative have geothermal energy under their soil. Our company can help them harness that energy.”\nThanks to the joint efforts of China and Iceland, more places in China and the world will be able to embrace greener and cleaner winters in the future.", "scores": {"score": 3, "score_transform_1": 5, "score_transform_2": 5, "score_transform_3": 0}}

In fact, visiting the park during the cold season can be a lot nicer since you’re avoiding the brutal heat of the average Arizona summer. January is the coldest month at Saguaro National Park, with daytime temperatures in the 50s and 60s. Make sure you bundle up if you go out to the desert at night since the temperatures drop to the 20s and 30s when the sun goes down. If you visit during December or January, waking up early in the morning can reward you with the sight of the giant saguaro cactuses crowned with freshly fallen snow.\nThere are also tons of things to do in the park at any time of year. Saguaro National Park features over 165 miles of trails for hiking, biking, and even horseback riding, located mostly in the Rincon Mountain District east of Tucson. The Rincon district is between two and three times the size of the western section, called the Tucson Mountain District, and has most of the trails. However, a few quick hikes in the Tucson neighborhood will take you to petroglyphs that the local Hohokam people left behind, which are an impressive sight. Both sides of the park have visitor centers as well, with plenty of information on the land, its native plants and wildlife, and the people who live there.\nIf you want to make the most of your next trip to Tucson, we recommend checking out our own Saguaro East National Park Self-Guided Driving Tour, available through our app on iOS and Android devices.

{"id": "6857", "text": "According to Gartner Group, 90% of companies don’t know how many printers they have or how much they spend on print.\nA big common misconception about Managed Print Services (MPS) is that it is only beneficial for large scale production. Wrong! To the contrary, MPS programs are completely customizable to the needs of the document output for your office. Therefore, whether you are a small, medium, or large company – you can benefit from MPS.\nHere are 5 ways that MPS can give your business an advantage and alleviate any printer stress..\nReduce Costs with MPS\nDid you know that print is typically the third highest business operating expense behind rent and payroll?\nThis is where a customized MPS solution comes into play. With a customized strategy you will see a big reduction in costs while adding value to your company. As well as, ensuring that the right equipment is implemented, eliminating unneeded printers, replacing inefficient devices, and strategically placing print equipment in an easily accessible area for groups of employees is all part of the MPS solution.\nManaging and monitoring a fleet of printers, scanners, and copiers is no small task and usually gets overlooked by many businesses. With MPS, you can save up to 96% in costs and here’s how:\n- 48% – 55% savings in ink and toner consumption, repairs and hardware costs\n- 18% – 27% savings through reducing paper usage, IT headcount, streamlining document workflows, and external print procurement\n- 7% to 14% savings from fewer help desk calls, improved paper document storage, and reduced environmental impact.\nPredict Budgets with MPS\nThe typical office worker prints 10,000 pages per year at an average cost of $725.\nWith no basic guidelines set into place on what, where, or how many pages an employee can print, you can be sure to see an increase in your printing expenses. In addition, 37% – 41% of print-related expenses avoid formal approval. Therefore, employees who purchase small printers and print-related consumables without approval are actually costing you more money than you think.\nWith the help of MPS programs, you will be able to consolidate your costs which will provide you with a consistent monthly investment. Accordingly, eliminating any maintenance surprises and unpredictable printing costs altogether.\nDecrease Your Environmental Footprint with MPS\nAs part of an MPS solution, your provider will analyze your printing needs to ensure you are using the right equipment and eliminate any unnecessary printers. Every office has different needs and therefore each program is a little bit different.\nAccordingly, with these 5 easy steps you can get your team on track and implement eco-friendly printing at the office:\n1. Develop a Printing Strategy Involve everyone and agree to a company printing strategy that will help keep control of all your copying.\n2. Print Fewer Copies Only print documents when it is absolutely necessary. There is always the option of providing documents to your employees and clients through digitally based formats such as pdf and eBooks.\n3. Reduce Paper Most modern multi-function printers can do duplex copying, reducing the amount of paper you need to use. Also, only print what you need – determine if you can cut down on printing large documents and settle for only printing a small part of it. Lastly, use recycled paper which has a lower environmental impact.\n4. Use Your Printer’s Sleep Settings Your printer does not have to be on when it is not being used. So, reduce your carbon footprint by saving up batches of copying and doing them in one go. Although, this may be difficult with larger offices with higher staff levels using the same copier, but there is always innovative ways that can save on your energy output.\n5. Reduce Toner User Printing a draft output rather than a full blooded copy can save on toner while still remaining easy to read. Though, it is not the type of print quality you would want to present to a client or use for a special event, it is adequate for in-house use.\nIncrease Employee Productivity with MPS\nToo often time is wasted walking across the building or to another floor for printing material, which as a result decreases your employee’s ability to efficiently get their work done. This is why the placement of printing equipment in easily accessible areas for an appropriate amount of employees is crucial to the improvement of workflow and device usage.\nIn addition to supporting print devices, MPS will also assess your organization’s existing workflow and productivity, ensuring you have the proper equipment in place to optimize efficiency in the office. After assessing your organization’s workflow, your provider will identify which equipment and processes suit your needs and what is required for your office to function more efficiently.\nDecrease Device Downtime with MPS\nUnder an MPS agreement you will receive routine maintenance and support from your provider – meaning, the process doesn’t end after installation. Once your office is equipped, you will also benefit from the continuous evaluation of device usage, management reports for process improvement, Service Level Agreement monitoring, remote device management, and redeployment of devices to match changing volumes.\nIn addition, multi-function printers can be monitored by your print provider through software installed on your network, which allows detection of issues before anyone in your office even realizes they exist. MPS can also assist in employee training and provide help desk support for print issues so that your IT department can focus on their regular tasks.", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}

Think back to the ancients when Eros and Aphrodite were literally role models for the people.\nFabulous climate, wonderful nature, islands, archipelagos almost invisible on maps, beaches, splendid coasts, beautiful clear waters, summer breeze, Italian food and wine – all these and more will make your sailing holidays in Italy unforgettable.\nItaly has many ports and yacht charters centers in the key sailing areas. Although most people refer to the whole sailing area as the Mediterranean, Italian waters are actually divided into several different areas: The Ligurian Sea, The North Tyrrhenian Sea, The Central Tyrrhenian Sea, The South Tyrrhenian Sea, The Sardinian Sea, The Strait of Sardinia, The Strait of Sicily, The North Ionian Sea, The South Ionian Sea, The North Adriatic Sea, The Central Adriatic Sea and The South Adriatic Sea.\nWhy motorboats are so common, catering the Italians’ love of speed? Cause winds vary greatly depending on the location and time of year. E.g., the islands of Sardinia and Sicily tend to enjoy more wind than the Bay of Naples and the Riviera. Nevertheless, here there is less wind in summer than other times of the year; as a result, yachts have to motor more than elsewhere in the Mediterranean. But, when the sun shines, and there is a warm, steady breeze, most yachtsmen would feel that the wait had been worth it.\nThough Italy has a marvelous coastline, the sailing infrastructure is still poor. The sailing here is mainly seen as a rich man’s sport in comparison to many Mediterranean countries. What about the sailing holidays in Italy? They are becoming more popular the recent years. Traditionally, the preferable destinations take place around Sicily and Sardinia, and the islands along the west coast.\nApart from being the homeland of spaghetti, pizza and other outstanding cuisine, Italy is a land of high fashion, fine art, luxury sport cars and exquisite architecture. Decades of the greatest World Heritage sites are located in this boot shaped country, for instance one of the Seven Wonders of the Modern World, Coliseum. Places, like the “Amalfi Coast” or the “Aeolian islands” or the “Five Lands” or “Sardinia”, are also listed in the Unesco World Heritage. Visiting even a small village will bring you in touch with the roman architecture, which left its fingerprint on the next generations.\nYacht sailing charters in Italy, bareboat or crewed, motorboats, catamarans and mega yachts are at your disposal to perfectly suite your needs.

He mentioned Atozy’s public dissing in his complaint, protesting against the use of phrases “shady dirtbag” and “dirtbag YouTuber.” Atozy’s video led viewers to believe Armstrong was paid by fraudsters to sell cryptocurrency to “suckers” willing to buy it, the complaint added.\nMengshoel also told viewers in the video that regulators were likely to probe such promotions, saying “it’s basically inevitable the SEC is going to get involved because dirtbags like this cannot resist the urge to take that quick buck and just milk their audience for some extra money.”\nArmstrong alleges in his complaint that Atozy’s “attack piece” significantly impacted his business as the number of his followers reduced, damaged his reputation and caused him severe anxiety. He said he fears being “perceived as a felon, a fraud, and untrustworthy in business or in general.”\nHis lawsuit seeks general, compensatory and special damages for defamation, intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress, tortious interference with business and violations of Georgia’s Uniform Deceptive Trade Practices Act and Fair Business Practice Act.\nBitBoy snubbed as hypeman by other commentators\nAtozy isn’t the only one criticizing BitBoy’s cryptocurrency promotions. A widely-followed Twitter user ZachXBT once shared a pamphlet showing the influencer’s rates for reviews, livestream mentions, YouTube interviews and website articles.\nA “dedicated review” was priced at $35,000, a screenshot of a media kit he shared with a potential client showed.\nMYX Network and DistX, both of which have made no gains since 2020, are among the dubious cryptocurrency tokens he’s promoted, according to ZachXBT. Armstrong once labeled a video on DistX “my most trusted coin,” but later went on to revise the title.\nSeparately, the YouTuber was recently described as an “untrained investment adviser” in a Washington Post report that highlighted his bad-mouthing of bankrupt lender Celsius after initially encouraging investors to deposit their money with the firm.\nHe told The Post that he doesn’t personally own cryptocurrencies, and that the chief financial officer of BitBoy — a media enterprise with 70 employees — handles all crypto transactions for the firm in case of potential conflicts.\nArmstrong’s lawyers from Krevolin & Horst didn’t return Blockworks’ request for comment by press time.

{"id": "6953", "text": "UTVs are extremely popular, and if you’re considering one, there are some fairly straight-forward points to consider, including…\n- For what will you be using the UTV? (e.g. speed vs. work, utility vs. trails)\n- In what kind of terrain will you be driving?\n- How much are you going to carry/tow?\n- Number of passengers?\n- How much power do you need?\n- How much can you spend?\nHowever, what if you don’t know what, exactly, you want and you’re having a hard time parting with $12,000-$25,000, depending on options, to get into a UTV? Or, what if you question the wisdom of the herd and you’re wary of the marketing hype surrounding UTVs?\nThe answer may reside in Minnesota’s northwoods\nRecently, I spent some time at my uncle’s lake cabin, where UTVs seem to be standard issue for the people who spend time there. Many of my uncle’s neighbors have UTVs, and I asked him when he was going to get his UTV. He responded that he was not going to pay $12,000 for a beefed-up golf cart, and instead he was going to buy a Suzuki Sidekick.\nRetired at 57 after 35 years as a master welder, boilermaker and skilled mechanic, I respect my uncle’s option on matters of financial frugality and anything to do with an engine. My uncle’s insights, coupled with a recent ride in a Sidekick in the Mojave Desert, inspired me to investigate the Suzuki Sidekick as a possible alternative to the UTV.\nA couple disclaimers regarding the Sidekick or similarly small SUVs\nBecause it’s a used vehicle and Suzuki has left the U.S. market, you’ll have to go online or to an auto parts store to get replacement parts, and if you don’t have the aptitude or appetite for DIY repairs and maintenance, the Sidekick may not be a good choice.\nAcknowledging these limitations, the chart below compared the popular Polaris Ranger SUV and a used Sidekick. Most notable is the price. The cost of the most basic options (doors, roof, windshield) on the Ranger exceed the total cost of the Sidekick. In addition to the obvious age and mileage difference, the weight and size of the Sidekick are disadvantages.\nAll things considered, if you’re considering a UTV, but you’re unsure what you want or have a hard time justifying the cost, the answer may be a Sidekick.", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}
{"id": "6958", "text": "Most of us have heard Republican candidate Donald Trump’s slogan “Make America Great Again” ad nauseam during this presidential campaign season. So what does this ‘greatness’ mean? And when did it occur, exactly? And is it possible to recreate it in the next 4 or 8 years?\nNPR’s Robert Siegel interviewed a few college republicans during All Things Considered to obtain their view of what it means to ‘Make America Great Again.’ Given that some Americans have lived through many presidents and decades of U.S. history, this slogan might resonate with them. But how do today’s college students answer that question? Most of them only have real memories of Barack Obama as president. They don’t recall 9/11 with much clarity, as most of them were in preschool. So what sort of historical memory informs their idea of a golden age in US history?\nThe two college republicans at The Ohio State University interviewed by Siegel responded to Donald Trump’s slogan “Make America Great Again” by citing our popularity in the world, and our unity and patriotism after 9/11:\nFirst and foremost, I think he wants America to be respected as a world power. Right now we are not respected at all. You know, when Obama said that, you know, when Syria uses chemical weapons against their people, that is the red line; and when they cross it, we will do X, Y, Z.\nWe didn’t do a damn thing. Pardon my language. But we know that we’re not No. 1 in the world, and we know that we’re not the best. And we want to be the best. And the fact that Trump wants that, too, is just phenomenal.\nI remember when it happened. They shut down my preschool, and my mom came and picked me up. She had to pull over to the side of the road because she was crying. And then after that, I remember at least for a little while, everyone felt good about being American and proud about being American. We knew who we were.\nInteresting responses. I wonder when we were “respected” as a world power. During our imperial age at the turn of century when we colonized the Philippines? After WWI when we joined toward the end, yet failed to join the League of Nations? After WWII and during the Cold War? During the more recent invasion of Iraq?\nI imagine most Muslim Americans are not keen to return to the days and months immediately following 9/11. Many Americans are probably not keen to return to the Bush presidency and invasion of Iraq following 9/11.\nI couldn’t resist asking my current US history survey students the same question: When was America great? Their response (to my great relief and pleasure): “what does ‘great’ mean”? And for which group of people?” Is this a foreign policy question? When were we the ‘best’ in the world? Is this a domestic policy question? Things were great for white males in the 1950s in the U.S. Unless you were a communist. Or gay. Or Russian. Most African Americans and women and minority groups would not like to return to the 1950s. In fact, most women and minorities prefer not to go back in time at all.\nIs the time right after the Revolution our golden era? Average Americans were better off economically as colonists under Britain than the early years as a struggling new nation. And white male upper class Americans were arguing for the type of government they thought best, while working class white male citizens just wanted to get paid from serving in the Revolutionary war and avoid bank foreclosures. And slavery was legal. Is WWII what we want to return to? The Cold War era? The 1920s and prohibition? So many options, and so much nuance and complexity. None of which make a neat and tidy presidential campaign slogan.\nMaybe I’ll just spend my time in the kitchen Making America Cake Again, and whip up some historical election day cake. Although, if I’m to be accurate to the early U.S. tradition, the cake would be my only contribution to election day since I would not have been allowed to vote.", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}

Affiliate programs and affiliations include Amazon Associates and the eBay Partner Network.\nI built this modular CNC controller to run a variety of different machines in my shop. My first application is to replace the old controller on my CNC Shark router but I wanted the flexibility to reuse the same hardware on different machines, so I came up with a standard connector layout that will let me swap the controller and power supply for different needs. Initially I’m using the DDCSV1.1 Control Panel but I could someday replace it with a different standalone controller or an Ethernet SmoothStepper and Mach3 or Mach4 software.\nThe second video covers details of wiring and configuration of the CNC controller.\nDDCSV1.1 Control Panel Documentation\nHere is the DDCSV1.1 User Manual that contains a wealth of information about this panel, including details of wiring and operation.\nHere are links to most of the parts that I bought on Amazon.com:\n- DDCS 4 Axis Control System\n- KL-5056 20-50VDC 5.6A Digital Bipolar Stepper Motor Driver – 32 bit DSP Based\n- BUD Industries AC-405 Aluminum Chassis, 7″ Length x 7″ Width x 2″ Height, Natural Finish\n- 2P5T 2 Poles 5 Position Rotary Switch\n- Ferrule Crimp Tool Kit\n- Remington Industries 18UL1007STRKIT UL1007 18 AWG Gauge Stranded Hook-Up Wire Kit\n- Connectors Pro DB37 Female D-Sub Solder Type Connector, 10-PK\n- D-Sub Hex Head Screw with Nut 4-40UNC\n- 400W 36V Switch Power supply, DC power S-400-36 11A\n- URBEST Inlet Module Plug 5A Fuse Switch Male Power Socket 10A 250V 3 Pin IEC320 C14\n- US 3 Pins Power Socket Plug Black AC 125V 15A\n- Blue Sea Systems Push Button Reset-Only CLB Circuit Breakers with Quick Connect Terminals\n- uxcell DB25 25 Pin Female to Male Solder Type Adapter Connectors 5 Pair\n- 12mm 5 Pin Aviation Connector Male Female\nI laid out the openings in the aluminum case for the pendant and cut out the front panel using my Dewalt scroll saw. The end panel couldn’t be cut on the scroll saw so I used a nibbling tool to make the openings for the USB and DB37 connectors. I also added aluminum L channels on the back of the case in order to mount the control panel:\nThe wiring was pretty straightforward but there were a lot of connections, and because most of them used screw terminals I used crimp ferrules on the wire ends. This was the first time I had used crimp ferrules and they worked great, much more secure and neat looking than bare wire ends.\nThe signal wiring is all 22-AWG stranded wire, and here’s the pinout that I used on the DB37 connector:\nI couldn’t find an off-the-shelf enclosure of the size that I wanted for the power supply module so I made my own from aluminum sheet using my ShopFox box and pan brake and plate shear. I ran the AC power from the switched inlet to a 10A circuit breaker, and then to the two power supplies. I also added an AC outlet to run the cooling pump for my 2.2KW water cooled spindle. On the 36V 11A supply for the stepper motors, I added a 22,000 microfarad capacitor to help absorb the current spikes from the stepper drivers.\nThe output current of the stepper drivers is configured using DIP switches and I have them set for 2.8A output current, which is the rating of the stepper motors in my CNC router. I could have used a larger power supply and drivers that would be sufficient to run the larger 6A stepper motors I plan to use on the milling machine, so that a single power unit could run either machine. But that would require changing the DIP switches when moving it between machines, which is inconvenient and error-prone so I chose to dedicate this power unit to running medium-size steppers and to build a separate one for the mill. I could still use this power unit on another machine such as my metal lathe, as long as I use stepper motors with similar current requirements.\nI set the stepper drivers for 1/16 microstepping, and the CNC Shark HD router’s X-Y lead screws have multi-start threads with a lead of 0.5 inch or 12.7 mm per rotation. So with 200-step stepper motors, the pulses per millimeter are calculated as 200 * 16 / 12.7 = 251.969. This number must be entered into the settings page on the CNC controller. The Z-axis lead screw has a finer lead of 0.25 inch or 6.35 mm per rotation so its setting is 503.937 pulses/mm.\nI use AutoDesk Fusion 360 to model 3D parts and to generate CNC toolpaths using its CAM capability. AutoDesk makes this software available FREE to hobbyists and it’s very powerful. It has a steep learning curve but there are lots of tutorials available for it. I initially started using Fusion 360 with the original controller for my CNC Shark router, but unfortunately it lacked a post-processor to generate compatible G-code so I wrote my own post-processor for it and the resulting G-code works with the original CNC Shark controller as well as the DDCSV1.1 control panel that I’m using now. To use this post-processor with Fusion 360, follow these steps:\n- In Fusion 360 select the CAM workspace, create a milling operation and generate a toolpath from it. You can find online help on CAM if you don’t know how to get that far.\n- Once your toolpath is generated, select it and either right-click to select the Post Process menu, or select the Post Process button on the toolbar at the top. Again you can find online help on post-processing if you need it.\n- In the Post Process dialog, next to ‘Post’, click the drop-down and select ‘Choose from library…’. On the left side under ‘My Posts’ select ‘Local’ (it may already be selected), and up above click the ‘Import’ icon. Browse for the .cps file that you saved in the step above, and press Open. You should only have to do this once – thereafter it should show up as an available post when you select the My Posts / Local item on the left.\n- Pressing the Post button will generate G-code that should work on the DDCSV1.1 controller, as well as on the original CNC Shark controller.\n- Transfer the resulting G-code file to the controller and run it. I strongly recommend “cutting air” at first, to test the G-code before performing actual machining with it. My usual technique is to raise the Z axis well above the part and then zero it out, so that I can test the code without actually cutting anything until I believe it’s correct.\nThe latest revision of this post-processor supports the M8/M9 output, which will be activated while running any toolpath with any Coolant setting other than ‘Disabled’. This output can be used to control a coolant pump for liquid cooling, an air valve for air blast cooling, a vacuum for dust removal etc. It has limited current capacity so an external relay is required for controlling any high-current loads. Please refer to your DDCS controller manual for documentation of the M8/M9 output.\nYou may email me at Jay (at) BrainRight (dot) com with reports of any problems or requests for enhancements to this Fusion 360 post-processor, but I provide it at no charge with no guarantee of any kind and I may or may not respond to requests for changes.", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

For example, sustainable aviation fuels remain more expensive than conventional aviation fuels, making any attempt to force airlines into using them likely to lead to considerable price increases for flights – a worrying proposition given Malta’s – and by extension Gozo’s – near-absolute reliance on air connectivity.\nIndeed, higher fuel prices in this area are anticipated in the short and medium term given the introduction of new rules stipulating that from 2025 at least two per cent of aviation fuels should be green, rising to six per cent by 2030 and 20 per cent in 2035, eventually reaching 70 per cent in 2050.\nIn the maritime sector, the extension from January 2024 of the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS) to vessels exceeding a gross tonnage of 5,000 visiting EU ports, will also “pose significant challenges for Malta,” notes Mr Borg, “lessening Malta’s competitiveness as a transhipment hub and putting our supply chain into jeopardy.”\n“Every effort needs to be made to focus on sustainability – the impacts of climate change are there for all to see – this should not be done at the expense of islands,” says Mr Borg, noting that the GBC has been vocal in this regard, especially on the proposals put forward by the Commission on the Energy Tax Directive, which will remove exemptions and incentives for the use of fossil fuels, for example in EU aviation and maritime transport.\nThe main issue with all these sustainability measures, according to the GBC CEO, is that each is likely to result in an inflationary push with impacts all across the supply chain: “In this respect there needs to be a constructive dialogue between all the social partners.”\nFinally, asked whether he expects 2024 to be a year of firefighting, or one of growth, Mr Borg warns of caution, with the post-COVID situation characterised by marked unpredictability.\n“Nonetheless, I believe that the growth trajectory should be sustained. However, this should be one which really benefits all the people. It is only then that as a country, and also an island region, we can continue to move forward.”\nPrice expectations rose among retailers and in the construction sector\nThe MCCAA has launched a public consultation about the mazzit’s Protected Geographical Indication rating\n‘The decision was primarily taken to strengthen the coordination between Government entities’", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}

{"id": "7056", "text": "Thanks for joining us for an interview today! Tell us about yourself:\nHi there! I’m Angela Ross. I’m 43 years old. I’m a wife to my hero, a medically retired U.S. Army combat veteran, and a mother to two amazing teen boys. For the moment, I’m a retired stay at home mom. I love the great outdoors, the more secluded, the better. I also enjoy gardening, photography, spending time with my three guys, cheering on the Reds, and fostering for a local dog rescue.\nWhat were your greatest challenges before Clean Eating?\nMy greatest challenges before CleanFoodCrush were not eating often enough, consuming too much sugar, lack of energy, eating out too much, and depression from being overweight.\nHow has CleanFoodCrush and the 30 Day Clean Eating Challenge helped you to transform your lifestyle?\nThe 30 Day Clean Eating Challenge helped me cut out refined sugars. I don’t even bat an eye at a Coca Cola anymore! Before, I had to drink a Coke every day. I’m also eating and enjoying whole grains, like brown rice, and A LOT of vegetables. I’ve learned how to measure out appropriate portions. We’ve scaled back on eating out as well. Now that I know what to eat, it’s a lot easier to be healthy!\nWhat kind of results have you experienced physically and otherwise from doing the challenge?\nI am still amazed by the results of the 30 Day Clean Eating Challenge. I lost 16.5 pounds, and I’m down a size in both my pants and shirt. Migraine headaches have been reduced significantly. I have more energy. I’m eating more food now than what I ate before when I just put junk in my body. I don’t feel bloated or full, but I always feel satisfied!\nAngela and her husband Before & After the 30 Day Clean Eating Challenge\nWhat was the experience like for you, for your family?\nEating Clean is a challenge, but it’s not expensive. I’m currently on my second round of the 30 Day Clean Eating Challenge. I hope to lose fifty more pounds, and as of my last weigh in, I’m a few ounces shy of losing 20 pounds. That’s 20 pounds in a month and a half! My three guys have all slimmed down. My husband also is down sizes in his pants and shirts. He lost approximately 15 pounds!\nI didn’t force our son’s to eat what we ate, but most of the time, they ate what we prepared, and they enjoyed it. My oldest son grabs hummus and pita when he gets home from school. My youngest goes for mixed berries and yogurt. This is a new way of life for all of us.\nWhat words of wisdom do you have for newcomers who are interested in taking the 30 day challenge\n“A journey of a thousand miles starts with one step.” Take the first step, CleanFoodCrush has everything you need to get you started and moving forward. Rachel Maser has put together a shopping list, detailed instructions, menus for each week, and a variety of recipes. She also is engaged daily with the participants, has CFC coaches available to answer questions, encourage, and support you on your journey. Beyond that, you have a connection and support with fellow crushers, taking that first step too. This by no means is a lose weight fast diet, there are no shakes, and no pills. This is a lifestyle change, and if you stick with it, YOU WILL see results.", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

{"id": "7084", "text": "In light of a recent Yelp reviews algorithm change called Spearfish, we’ve assembled pro tips for making the best of the Yelp filtered reviews guidelines.\nYelp Filtered Reviews: The Ins and Outs\nA couple of things to remember about Yelp filtered reviews:\n- Yelp aims to filter reviews that weren’t written from an actual customer. There are people who try to game the system for their own gain on Yelp, whether by creating a Yelp user profile and writing fake positive reviews about their own business or posting fake negative reviews about a competing business. Yelp’s goal is to protect business reputations as much as possible and give users a real shot at picking a vendor based on authentic customer feedback.\n- Reviews are never deleted – they’re either filtered or unfiltered, and they’re always accessible on a Yelp business profile. Only unfiltered reviews are used to calculate the profile’s star rating.\n- Yelp’s filter aims to preserve the quality of reviews, so that people continue trusting Yelp when they’re shopping for a new service provider or product. Without this trust, Yelp’s platform means nothing to its users.\n- Yelp doesn’t explicitly publicize all of its criteria for filtering reviews because it knows that if they show all of their cards, people can learn to game the system and eventually invalidate the review filter.\n- Review status is fluid, meaning Yelp can bump a review that was once deemed worthy of the “unfiltered” category down to the filtered section, because Yelp no longer trusts some factor or element of that review or reviewer. Reversely, a review that was once in the filtered section can eventually be moved into the Yelp-approved review pool on a business profile.\nBottom line, Yelp wants reviews to be honest, genuine and unsolicited. It doesn’t want people to use it for deceitful purposes. So, they reconfigured things to make reviews more fair-and-square. But how do they determine which reviews needed to go, and which ones needed to now show as unfiltered?\nThings That Will Likely Trigger Yelp’s Review Filter\nHere’s a couple of examples where today, Yelp would deem a review unfit for the highly coveted “unfiltered” status. Stay away from these shady tactics and you’ll likely avoid being penalized.\nWhile we admire your passion, don’t go after new reviews with these online means:\n- Don’t send out an email, post a Facebook status or use other online messaging platforms to share a link to your Yelp page hoping for a new review\n- Don’t ask customers to visit your website, click the Yelp badge you installed there and then go and review you\n- Don’t attempt to post on public sites like Craigslist and try to buy Yelp reviews from non-clients\n- Don’t pay people to review your business on Yelp\nAll of the above (and any other creative avenues not mentioned here) sends Yelp a signal that someone is driving people to their profile to place a review. In this digital day and age, almost all activity can be tracked back to a source; Yelp’s good at figuring out if you emailed all of your customers a sweet message and link to your Yelp page.\nWhile it’s tempting to ask the happy customers you talk to in your shop every day to hit up your Yelp page and make it rain with good ratings, try to avoid this approach. There are review patterns, such as time and date of posting and the age of accounts reviewing you that just scream “This shop is recruiting new Yelp reviews!”\nIf you were Yelp and looking for red flags, wouldn’t it grab your attention if 10 new Yelp accounts were created in the same month, and then all of those accounts posted new reviews to the same business? In addition, it will look extra fishy if only a handful went to the trouble of filling out their profile info and added a picture to their user profile.\nAnd what if none of them checked into the business on Yelp when placing their review – the testimony was written after the experience when they were no longer physically located in the business?\n(Bonus points for the Yelp filtered reviews police if five of those accounts were created using the desktop version of Yelp and then the reviews were written, or if none of those accounts bothered reviewing other businesses after they were created!)\nAn additional problem for soliciting Yelp reviews in-person is that if that customer is a secret shopper (yes, Yelp invests in them!), then they may very well report if they’ve been asked to place a Yelp review.\nSo in the end, when you post a review, what device you post it from, if you’re checked in to the business when you post, and how old your account is (and consequently how many Yelp reviews of different businesses you’ve written) and more all paint a picture to Yelp of just how genuine (and unsolicited) a review may have been.\nSo What’s Next With Yelp Filtered Reviews?\nBottom line: if you do good work and you honor your customer’s reasonable requests, the good reviews will come. Yes, there will be the occasional “bad” review; successful businesses know that a less-than-stellar review is an invaluable glimpse into how they can fine-tune customer service and create a better experience.\nIf you respond to negative reviews with kindness, patience and diplomacy, people who are browsing businesses online will know you’re an authentic company that tries to fix problems and make things better. (People will even edit their reviews and add information after businesses have attempted to make things right!)\nSo, don’t sweat the small stuff with Yelp filtered reviews. If you’re providing great customer service, it will show in your review mix and potential customers will take notice. Word-of-mouth, online or in-person, is still a reliable best friend.", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

{"id": "7106", "text": "I’m an “Undesignated Transitional” student…what does that mean?\nA student who does not meet departmental retention standards may be dismissed from his or her major. Students who do not meet the criteria for college dismissal are then moved into an “Undesignated Transitional” status and will work closely with the Center for Student Success (CSS) until they have met the entrance requirements and have been successfully admitted into a new program.\nThere are cases where students are able to reapply to their previous program by retaking foundation courses. Interested students should have this conversation with the Chair or Assistant Dean immediately after the departmental dismissal to understand whether this is a viable option. Some departments DO NOT allow for readmission. Throughout this process, students will continue to work with their CSS advisor.\nAs students may not graduate under the “transitional” designation, it’s critical to take steps toward exploring new programs immediately and seek guidance from BOTH the Center for Student Success and any prospective programs.\nPlease be advised that TCNJ majors are competitive and completing foundation/entrance courses does not guarantee admission. Therefore, it’s important to develop a “parallel plan” (or alternate plan) with your CSS advisor. By exploring more than one program with an advisor, students are able to envision several paths to achieve their goals.\nDepending on your length of time as a transitional student, you might fall into one of the following categories. Please review the accompanying suggestions:\nIf you’ve just received your departmental dismissal notification, please immediately connect with the Center for Student Success to better understand the role they will play as you look to transition to a new program. Schedule an appointment with a CSS advisor, and make sure you have clearly read and understand your dismissal letter.\nIf you’re seeking re-entrance into your previous program, speak with the Chair or Assistant Dean about the re-application process. Department dismissal letters often indicate whether re-entry is permitted, and if so, you’ll want to have a clear sense of what this process will entail. You’ll also want to discuss with the department and your CSS advisor whether this route makes sense based on your strengths, goals, and possible extended timeline toward graduation.\nIf you’ve recently completed the foundation course(s) required to apply to your major, please make sure you understand the guidelines and timeline for the application process. Many “Change of Major” windows take place early in the semester, so if you’re not sure, ASK. You can typically find the guidelines on the department’s website, or you may contact the department chair. CSS is also available to help navigate this process.\nIf you still need to complete foundation courses, are you taking the necessary courses in the upcoming semester(s) and/or there a plan in place? If you need help with your schedule, CSS staff are available to assist as much as possible, but please be aware that CSS cannot place students into full/restricted courses. This is the academic department’s decision only, and many departments will not lift pre-requisites.\nIf you’re not sure what major interests you, are you taking steps to point you in a direction? In addition to working with your CSS advisor, here are some suggestions:\n-A counselor in the Career Center can help you explore your interests, values and skills through various assessments. The Career Center website also has information about what students can do with particular majors. http://career.tcnj.edu/\n-Explore departmental websites and reach out to the chairperson of areas you might like to explore.\n-Take an introductory course (or two) that may help you narrow down your search.\nMeeting with the Center for Student Success\nThe Center for Student Success places advising holds on PAWS for all Undesignated Transitional students. While you’ll be required to meet for an advising appointment as the next semester’s registration window draws closer, you’re encouraged to come into the Center for Student Success as often (and as soon) as you’d like to map out your semester. Frequent “check-ins” can help students work toward a successful semester. Some students benefit from weekly meetings, while others find coming in for a few appointments helps them stay on track.\nIn addition to Academic Advising, the Center for Student Success provides Academic Coaching in areas such as time management and a host of other study skills. Focusing on an individual’s unique study strengths and challenges can aid in a student’s successful transition to a new program.\nTo make an appointment with CSS, you may email firstname.lastname@example.org or stop into the main office, Roscoe West Room 131.", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

{"id": "7158", "text": "The Advantages of a Structured Cabling System\nHaving a fully engineered and properly installed structured cabling system technology is one of the most cost-effective and timely decisions you can make for your business. It'll make routine moves, adds & changes faster, much more efficient, and has tangible and intangible advantages. The enhancement in productivity, faster rollout of strategic company applications, and more efficient troubleshooting features and capabilities will help any business to be more successful. Rather than reacting to each upgrade of hardware, implementing a properly planned structured cabling system can reduce personnel hours and investment costs.\nSo, is your data center ready? Apart from being cost-effective, what are the other advantages of a Structured Cabling System?\nThere is a high level of simplicity and straightforwardness that comes with an organized cabling system. In a typical office environment, several different devices and IT equipment are being used at the same time, so running everything off one single system eliminates the complexity of having multiple wiring infrastructures in place. For example, if a problem occurs, it is far easier to identify the issue and solve it with structured network cabling. This means far less time and money lost in the long term.\nGrowth & adaptability\nStructured cabling systems technology is built with adaptability and growth in mind. Being able to continuously upgrade your telecommunication system needs without an overhaul of your current cabling technology saves your company so much time and money. Additionally, when your business outgrows your current building, transferring your cabling system technology and reinstalling your network infrastructure is much more approachable than relocating a complex, old cabling system.\nBetter return on investment\nDue to the optimal design of a structured network cabling system, there's less maintenance and replacement involved.\nYour company will also save money on wiring and cables in the long run. Not to mention, companies that have flexible voice and data systems have an easier time communicating with clients.\nNeat, tidy AND safe!\nPre-planned cabling systems are often hidden from plain sight. If they are visible, they are neatly bundled and plugged into their respective machines. There's no mess. And messy cabling systems are downright unsafe, increasing the chances of fires, electrical shocks, and trips and falls.\nUnorganized cabling systems with tangled wires often cause connectivity issues, which can result in network downtime & decreased productivity. There is a high risk of human error and mistakes being made with multiple, unorganized cabling structures, causing workflow disruptions/network downtime. It's the nature of technology hardware to malfunction from time to time. A structured cabling system makes it less time-consuming to isolate the problem and solve it.\nWorks with the Internet of Things (IoT)\nThe Internet of Things (IoT) refers to the connection of any device, whether it's a smartphone or a smart car, to the internet.\nIoT-enabled devices are becoming more and more common in the workplace.

{"id": "7177", "text": "[primary_practice] is now proudly offering Votiva treatments. This revolutionary advance in aesthetic surgery is helping women everywhere feel more confident by rejuvenating both internal and external tissues in the vaginal area.\nWomen are talking about Votiva and many of them have questions, so we’ve put together this brief post addressing Votiva frequently asked questions to answer some of them.\nLet’s find out more about Votiva and what it has to offer women.\nWhat is it?\nWomen know that the appearance and function of the vagina changes over time. That’s especially true if you’ve had children. Many women turn to surgery to address issues of muscle slackness and the changing appearance of the labia.\nBut Votiva precludes the need for surgery. With no anesthetic and no recovery time, Votiva improves blood circulation in the area and addresses challenges of sensitivity. Also addressed are elasticity and the appearance of the vulva and labia.\nVotiva takes only a few minutes per treatment, one of the primary reasons it’s gaining widespread popularity.\nWhat’s it like?\nUsing two handheld devices, Votiva applies heat technology. The Fractora V and Forma V devices are used both internally and externally to improve muscle and skin tone.\nHypertrophy of the labia (meaning enlargement, or lengthening) and laxity of vaginal muscles are treated using Votiva and deep heating can be applied to encourage the production of elastin and collagen, which serve to improve the skin’s elasticity.\nWhen will I see results?\nEveryone’s different, but some patients see results after one session. Usually, two sessions are required for optimal results.\nBut Votiva works over time, with the most dramatic results seen several weeks after the initial treatments. Subsequent sessions will increase the effectiveness of Votiva.\nWill it hurt?\nBecause this treatment uses heat produced by lasers, there’s little in the way of discomfort. Some patients report discomfort on insertion of the device, but this more to do with nervousness on the part of the patient, which promotes vaginal dryness.\nThe therapy is virtually painless.\nAm I a candidate for Votiva?\nVotiva is most beneficial for women who’ve given birth, are experiencing the symptoms of menopause, or are encountering vaginal difficulties like dryness, due to chemotherapy.\nWomen who’ve undergone hysterectomies may also benefit greatly from Votiva therapy.\nVotiva is a breakthrough in vaginal rejuvenation. It help women feel more comfortable and whole, by addressing issues arising from all the challenges enumerated above. At [primary_practice], we’re proud to be able to offer women this excellent alternative to corrective surgery.\nIn good hands with [primary_practice].\nBecause we’re a medical facility which offers aesthetic services, we’re staffed by professionals with your total wellbeing in mind.\nIn tandem with our primary care services, we offer people from all walks of life leading edge medical cosmetic treatments.

{"id": "7196", "text": "| Our home /property was damaged and contaminated with asbestos on 14/6/2013 by our neighbours fatal home explosion. His home was made of asbestos and the blast showered surrounding properties (including ours) with asbestos fragments making it unsafe to return home.\nAs the explosion made national news you can find/verify information regarding the incident by googling ‘Tuncurry Explosion’.\nThere were 4 residents/families including ours displaced on that day, 3 of which have been able to return to their homes at various times during that past 18 months. To date our home is the only property which has not been restored and we are the only residents insured with ANZ.\nMy son and I have been forced to relocate several times and remain in temporary rental accomodation (currently we reside in the 3rd).\nThe Short But Factual Version Of Our Ongoing Struggle:\n- We have held ANZ Home and Contents insurance for over a decade. ANZ insurance is currently underwritten by QBE.\n- We have never missed a payment, have always paid via direct debit and in fact still pay for our policies even though we haven’t been able to live there.\n- ANZ insurance ceased paying our temporary accomodation leaving us with mortgage payments and temporary accomodation rent. We can’t afford to continue paying both as I am a sole parent and therefore our sole bread winner.\n- ANZ have accepted our claims.\n- ANZ have paid part of our contents claim, we are unsure why this hasn’t been finalised however this is of little consequence when we don’t have a home. What they did pay however was useful and has now been exhausted into our mortgage/rent payments.\n- ANZ representatives advise that although my policy is ANZ Insurance, ANZ consider themselves unable to assist us?? I have asked numerous ANZ representatives (including their CEO) why they continue to choose to be underwritten by QBE when QBE are not providing the protection to their customers properties in accordance to their policies and product disclosure statements, I am yet to receive a response.\n- To date my property remains contaminated and therefore deemed ‘unsuitable for residential use’.\n- This fact was only proven after I fought for second opinion on the asbestos clean-up due to 2 failed attempts requiring Workcover intervention, by the insurers asbestos ‘experts’. This process took me from July 2013 – January 2014 at which time the new asbestos team confirmed the current dangerous contamination.\n- In February the insurer acknowledged this outcome and committed to paying the new asbestos company to complete the clean-up however to date this has not occurred. I have begged, pleaded and complained everywhere but still no progress.\n- ANZ has not apologised for the risk they placed my family in by insisting our property was safe up until I successfully proved their opinion inaccurate.\n- An ANZ Insurance appointed an engineer has attended my property twice, firstly in November 2013 and again in January 2014. The engineer wrote a report after both visits and there is currently 3 scopes of work as a result of these reports. The issue with these is none of them match. Some scopes have some details, some scopes have others and some reported damage is not in any of the scopes?? I escalated these obvious issues to the insurer and received a written committment that the builders would attend with all of the scopes when quoting. Disappointingly yet predictably this did not occur resulting in the builders attending in January/February 2014 and only being able to quote on the one scope they were issued.\n- The engineers report from January 2014 makes note of the fact that our home had deteriorated since his previous visit in November 2013 due to the home being unoccupied and remaining open to the elements via blown out windows not being fixed and therefore allowing in wind, water, squatters, animals, vermin etc.\n- Reported deterioration November 2013 – January 2014 yet we are now in December 2014 and the insurer has done NOTHING. Obviously and unfairly our home has continued its steady but predictable deterioration.\nWe have resisted media contacts until recently when we agreed to tell our story as we sincerely hoped our claim would be settled fairly and privately, however we now accepted this will not be the case.\nIt is very humbling to ask for help and I only speak up now out of pure desperation for our financial future and wellbeing.\nWe know ANZ and QBE don’t care, we know we are nothing but a faceless insignificant number to them, but we hope Australians do care and will want to help us.\nWe are not asking for anything unreasonable. We have paid for and held our ANZ polices in good faith for many years. We simply want ANZ Insurance to step up and live up to their promises.\nThank you for taking the time to read our story. Should you choose to sign our petition that would be wonderful and we will be forever grateful.", "scores": {"score": 0, "score_transform_1": 0, "score_transform_2": 0, "score_transform_3": 1}}

This project is the Green Paper for the Labour Market, which constitutes a renewed attempt at implementing the so-called SALEK agreement. To summarise, the ideas behind the project are meant to reduce the negotiating power of the unions, limit the possibility to strike and put the wage setting in the hands of specialist committees. A lot of pressure has been put on the union movement behind the scenes to convince us to take part in this governmental project. It is necessary to inform the members of Efling about the background and context regarding this and explain the debate that took place within ASÍ regarding the participation in the Green Paper and open discussions so that the members can express their thoughts on this topic. Recently, at the meetings of the Delegate Council we have been talking in discussion groups led by volunteers from amongst the union members. This arrangement has proven to work well, and we have had many substantive debates. We will continue using this approach at this meeting. At the end of the meeting we will shortly present the new Efling website. The new website features significant improvements to available information and the interface. We have gathered a lot of great experience with holding bigger union meetings online, but we realise that this arrangement may be challenging to many of our members.

{"id": "7220", "text": "The Science of Programming/Introduction\nA student of mine once remarked, after taking a programming languages class from me, that she had grown from a \"syntax coder\" to a Computer Scientist. She once knew only enough syntax to get a program to compile and to run, after a fashion, but now she can identify a computable problem, sort through a set of strategies for solving the problem, weigh their advantages and disadvantages, and implement the chosen strategy in a robust program.\nI can take a little credit for this transformation, but I believe the honor should fall to the textbook I chose, SICP: \"The Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs\" by Harold Abelson, Gerald Jay Sussman, and Julie Sussman. The Wizard Book, as it is affectionately known, is a wonderful text that challenges students to learn the nature of computation and data. An earlier edition of that very book lead me on that same journey from syntax coder to Computer Scientist. The book is so versatile it has been used as an introductory computer science text at some universities and as a programming languages text at others. In fact, I tell my students that if they were to be marooned on a desert island and they could take one computer science text, SICP should be their hands-down choice.\nThe existence of such a text as SICP is quite a deterrent to creating this textbook, but we have embarked upon such a task. If there are any drawbacks to SICP, they would be in the choice of Scheme as programming language to illustrates the concepts therein. While the authors justify their choice well, the use of Scheme has probably prevented a wider adoption of SICP as an text for introductory computer science courses.\nThis is not a fault of Scheme, which is an elegant, fun, and easy to learn language, but rather in the parochial view that students need to learn \"practical\" languages. These days, practical means the programming language C and the languages derived therefrom, C++ and Java, both of which add object-orientation while maintaining a C-like syntax. This trend towards object-orientation is the second, and perhaps more valid, criticism of Scheme and thereby the choice of SICP as an introductory text; Scheme lacks formal object-orientation. While there have been many attempts to add object-orientation to Scheme and LISP-like languages, the results have looked much like a Victorian home with a ranch-style addition - serviceable, but with jarring aesthetics.\nThe Sway Programming Language edit\nThe idea of the Sway programming language arose in this environment. I had been using a simplified C-like pseudocode in teaching an Algorithms class and my experiences teaching programming languages led me to believe I could implement a good portion of the pseudocode language. I chose the name Sway as I would often misspell pseudocode as psuedocode, which I reckon should be pronounced Sway-dough-code.\nI designed Sway to have nearly the elegance of Scheme and all the fun, but with a C-like syntax to ease the transition of students from Sway to an industrial-strength language like C, C++, or Java. Moreover, Sway incorporates a fiendishly simple object and inheritance system based on a combination of previously published research in object orientation by others and my own research in this area. The idea that Sway should be fun makes the language a little more dangerous for novices. The point is: I wish to teach about computation and computational strategies rather than how to write a for loop in some toy language. To do so, the language of instruction needs to be expressive, the more expressive, the better. Also, I hope to avoid the pitfall of the Niklaus Wirth's Pascal programming language, a language, like Sway, designed for teaching. Wirth chose a rather rigid language model so that the language would be easier to learn. Under such a model, error messages generated by the language processor usually point out the error that led to the problem quite directly. Unfortunately, the language was inflexible and could not grow. This rigidness was responsible for Pascal falling, for the most part, by the wayside.\nSway is designed to grow in ways unanticipated by me and I have given Sway some properties that I believe give the language a solid base from which to grow. On the downside, this built-in flexibility can, at times, cause some rather obscure error messages. For example, a missing semicolon might generate a \"missing expression\" error message rather than the hoped for \"missing semicolon\" message. To make up for this trade-off, special care has been taken to make Sway monolingual. That is, the very same constructs for writing a program can be used to debug (fix errors). In fact, unlike most textbooks, this one provides a link to an entire chapter on the debugging of Sway programs, from the mundane (print expressions) to the sublime (running an interactive interpreter within a program).\nOrganization of the Book edit\nThis textbook is designed for students who would like a little practice in programming before moving on to a traditional CS1 class. The Science of Programming takes a non-traditional transit through the material, however. Rather than focusing on language features, the emphasis is on using a programming language to help the student understand material in an entirely different domain. In this case, the domain is Introductory Calculus. The student learns to program by writing short algorithms for solving Calculus problems. At the same time, students learn about Calculus and thus get a little practice in this subject before moving on to their first Calculus course.\nIn my mind, current CS1 textbooks suffer from a number of flaws. The first is that they tend to be encyclopedic. Thus many of the great concepts of computer science are obscured by a deluge of details. I don't, and I suspect many students do not, want to wade through an 800 page (or worse) textbook. Another flaw is that when examples are used to motivate language features, a detour is taken away from the example to introduce some new language construct, breaking up the narrative. Yet another flaw is that examples are usually contrived and not very convincing motivators for learning CS.\nTSOP attempts to solve the first two flaws by taking advantage of the benefits offered by hosting the textbook online. When a particular language construct is needed to accomplish some task in TSOP, the reader is instructed to follow a link to learn about the construct, if desired. These links lead to sections in the Sway Reference Manual, a companion text to TSOP. These little pointers do not disturb the flow of the overall narrative. The final flaw is ameliorated by the use of examples (calculus) that are most certainly of benefit to a Computer Science major.\nThe chapters of TSOP follow exactly the text of Calculus Made Easy, by Sylvanus P. Thompson and updated by Martin Gardner. For a student who already knows Calculus, TSOP (with the Sway Reference Manual) stands by itself. For a student who wishes to learn calculus as well as programming, Calculus Made Easy is a necessary, and comforting, companion.\n- No student has ever inquired as to how such a situation might arise.\n- The effect of encapsulation can be achieved through the use of function closures, but Scheme lacks a method allowing these object-like closures to inherit functionality from other closures.\n- I taught this class using the text \"Introduction to Algorithms\" by Cormen, Lieserson, and Rivest. This another of the great Computer Science textbooks and is affectionately known as CLR or the White Book, although subsequent additions were no longer white. Unfortunately, students felt the pseudocode used in the book was more confusing than not.\n- A common complaint from novice students is that \"this error message makes no sense\". Most practical languages suffer from error messages that do not seem to correspond with the actual error. In a testament to Pascal's error system, I remember as a student having the Pascal compiler tell me that I forgot a semicolon in such and such a place and would I like for it to insert the semicolon for me!\n- As an example of a non-monolingual language, it is said that one needs to learn three languages to become proficient at C programming: C, language itself, cpp, the C preprocessor, and gdb, a debugger for C.", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}
{"id": "7223", "text": "Daily report for 22 November 2010\nMontreal Protocol MOP 22\nThe preparatory segment of Montreal Protocol MOP-22 convened for its fourth day in Bangkok, Thailand, on Thursday, 11 November 2010.\nIn the morning, delegates attended the opening of the High-level segment. Delegates then convened in plenary throughout the day to hear presentations by heads of delegations.\nContact groups on ODS destruction, QPS uses of methyl bromide and ToRs on evaluation of the financial mechanism and replenishment of the MLF, an informal group on low-GWP alternatives, and the Budget Committee met throughout the day.\nOPENING OF THE HIGH-LEVEL SEGMENT\nMichael Church, Minister of Environment (Grenada), MOP-21 President, applauded the universal ratification of the Protocol and appealed to the few parties that have not ratified the amendments to do so expeditiously.\nExecutive Secretary Marco González, on behalf of UNEP Executive Secretary Achim Steiner, thanked the government of Thailand for hosting the meeting. He highlighted that parties to Montreal Protocol have not only succeeded in protecting the ozone layer, but also contributing to protecting the global climate system, and appealed to parties to make greater efforts. He paid tribute to Madhava Sarma, former Executive Secretary of the Ozone Secretariat, and other two distinguished members of the ozone community who recently passed away. Participants held a moment of silence to express condolences. González also expressed appreciation for the contribution made by TEAP Co-Chair Jose Pons Pons, EEAP Co-Chair Jan van der Leun and UNEP OzonAction Branch Head Rajendra Shende, who are retiring.\nTrairong Suwankiri, Deputy Prime Minister (Thailand), opened the High-level segment of MOP-22, and highlighted Thailand’s success in having phased-out more than 10,000 tonnes of CFCs. He stressed the most important issues under MOP-22’s consideration are: the ToR for the TEAP study of the replenishment of the MLF; the HFC amendment proposals; and the issue of ODS destruction.\nORGANIZATIONAL MATTERS MOP-22 elected by acclamation Steven Reeves (UK) as President; Hassen Hannachi, (Tunisia), Abid Ali (Pakistan) and Sonja Ruzin (Serbia) as Vice Presidents; and Michael Church (Grenada) as Rapporteur. Delegates also adopted the agenda (UNEP/OzL.Pro.22/1/Add.1).\nMOP-22 President Reeves encouraged participants to submit any outstanding credentials to the Secretariat.\nPRESENTATIONS OF ASSESSMENT PANELS ON THEIR QUADRENNIAL ASSESSMENT\nNoting the Executive Summary had been released, and the full report would be available in early 2011, SAP Co-Chair A.R. Ravishankara (US) emphasized that the SAP findings strengthen its 2004 conclusions that the Montreal Protocol is achieving its objectives.\nEEAP Co-Chair Janet Bornman (Denmark) presented on the EEAP’s findings on links between climate change, ozone depletion and UV radiation, noting, among other issues, human health, terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems and biogeochemical cycles.\nTEAP Co-Chair Lambert Kuijpers (the Netherlands) presented the preliminary TEAP assessment report, and outlined the content of each TOC report. In a short question period, participants discussed the TEAP’s proposed GWP classification scale and HCFCs in the foam sector.\nPRESENTATION BY THE MULTILATERAL FUND\nExCom Chair Javier Ernesto Camargo Cubillos (Colombia) presented the work of the ExCom’s past three meetings (UNEP/OzL/Pro.22/8). He highlighted, among other things: progress on funding to support accelerated HCFC phase-outs; additional funding for low-GWP alternatives to HCFCs; and the development of an MLF Climate Impact Indicator to evaluate technologies for replacing HCFCs.\nHe outlined efforts by the UNDP, UNEP, the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) and the World Bank to assist in implementation of the Protocol, particularly for Article 5 countries. He noted, inter alia, work on HCFC phase-outs and licensing systems, ODS destruction projects, and possible uses of carbon markets.\nSTATEMENTS BY HEADS OF DELEGATIONS\nGRENADA reiterated its support for upgrading the post of Executive Secretary of the Ozone Secretariat to ASG. JAPAN stressed that incentives for all parties to address ODS banks must be explored, and that the scope of the MLF should be clear, to avoid duplication. The US underscored the need to avoid undoing the Protocol’s achievements and said his country would not tolerate inaction based on bureaucratic excuses. INDONESIA highlighted its commitment to phasing out HCFCs, stressed the need to reduce halon dependency of aircraft and offered to host MOP-23. UGANDA said existing networks tackling illegal trade of ODS require strengthening at the national and regional levels.\nARMENIA outlined its efforts to phase-out the consumption of ODS. BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA explained it has phased out 250 tonnes of CFCs and initiated implementation of its HCFC management plan. ZIMBABWE noted his country lacks feasible ODS disposal options, said a mobile destruction facility was necessary, and promoted natural refrigerants. LAOS PDR outlined its work in developing its HCFC management plan. Highlighting the importance of addressing ODS destruction, the EU stressed that innovative and collaborative ways to address banks to capture the climate benefits are required. SAMOA and the SOLOMON ISLANDS highlighted the need for assistance for ODS destruction and expressed interest in working with other Pacific island countries on this.\nSERBIA described his government's ozone awareness-raising work with the education ministry. INDIA stressed that many policy issues on funding for HCFC phase-out are yet to be resolved, and emphasized HFCs are outside the scope of the Protocol. Highlighting the scope of the Protocol’s work ahead, KENYA called on all parties to be prepared to compromise. MONGOLIA stressed the importance of the involvement of the business community in meeting Protocol commitments. MALAWI described its efforts at phasing out methyl bromide in the agricultural sector.\nBAHRAIN underscored its interest in supporting the HFC amendment proposal. The DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO expressed concern over the low levels of financing for HCFC activities due to recent decisions of the ExCom. FSM said the best reason for phasing out HFCs was “because we can.” ANGOLA described a proposed initiative to prevent illegal trade with neighboring countries. NEW ZEALAND described its efforts to balance biosecurity priorities with ozone protection, through capture of methyl bromide used for QPS. Describing the reconversion of a foam factory, the DOMINICAN REPUBLIC said this was a key activity in phasing out HCFCs.\nFinancial mechanism: In the afternoon, delegates met to continue considering the text of ToRs on the evaluation of the financial mechanism and replenishment of the MLF. In the open session on replenishment, no consensus was found on the text remaining in square brackets, but participants agreed to consider compromise text proposed by one party and to return to the issue in a later session.\nParties then discussed the outstanding evaluation issues, in a closed session. Delegates considered operative issues, including questions of budgets and who should undertake the evaluation. They also discussed the text of the annex, and agreed to consider some compromise text drafted in informal consultations. The group agreed to meet again on Friday in an effort to complete its work.\nODS destruction: The contact group met on Thursday to resume consideration of a draft decision on environmentally sound management of ODS banks (UNEP/OzL.Pro.22/3 XXII/[L]). Delegates agreed to delete a paragraph calling on the ExCom to consider the funding of cost-effective destruction projects during the next replenishment period.\nDelegates then discussed additional funding opportunities for the management of ODS banks. Many developed country parties recalled the seminar on the sound management of ODS banks held in July 2010, and called for including the GEF as a funding source, noting the opportunities for partnership and co-financing that the GEF presents. Disagreeing and calling for removal of all references to the GEF, one developing country party expressed concern that the GEF may give higher priority to other MEAs in their current and future replenishments, and had not provided adequate financing for destruction of ODS banks in the past. He stressed that all funding for the destruction of ODS banks should come from the MLF. The Secretariat briefed parties that, although the GEF replenishment is not as “robust as hoped for,” there may still be a small amount of funding available for possible investment in ODS destruction projects if, inter alia, POPs destruction could be carried out simultaneously. Trying to break the deadlock, one developed country party suggested inviting parties to explore the many possible opportunities for financial resources and synergies described in the document and presentations from the seminar for the sound management of ODS banks.\nIn the afternoon, noting that no consensus could be reached on the decision, the contact group suspended discussion. They agreed to reconvene briefly on Friday to discuss the way forward in future sessions.\nQPS uses of methyl bromide: Co-chaired by Robyn Washbourne (New Zealand) and Tri Widayati (Indonesia), the contact group on QPS uses of methyl bromide met on Thursday afternoon.\nThe EU presented a revised CRP on the subject. Some parties did not agree to references to developing a strategic view on methyl bromide use for QPS, or to encouraging parties to report the main categories of use for methyl bromide. No consensus was reached in the group on these issues.\nBudget Committee: The group continued consideration of an amended proposal by the Secretariat to upgrade the post of Executive Secretary to the level of ASG, which it said considered all parties’ concerns. One developed country party reiterated their inability to agree to the upgrade, and prefered that the wording be kept general to allow the President of the MOP-21 Bureau a “wide range of options for the extension” of the Executive Secretary’s term. The committee agreed to add a footnote on the Executive Secretary’s budget line (UNEP/OzL.Pro.22/4), requesting UNEP’s Executive Director and the UN Secretary-General “to explore any means to retain the current Executive Secretary until 2015,” dropping the reference to the ASG upgrade.\nDelegates also discussed the Secretariat’s proposed draft decision on financial matters. On funding the evaluation of the financial mechanism, one delegate informed participants that current discussions in the financial mechanism contact group indicate that the required funds may either come from the drawdown, authorized by the parties, or from the MLF. One delegate informed delegates of another option put forward by the ToR group of having the UN’s joint inspection unit carry out the evaluation. Delegates agreed to finalize deliberations once the contact group on the financial mechanism had completed its work.\nInformal group on low-GWP alternatives to ODS: Co-chaired by Blaise Horisberger (Switzerland) and Leslie Smith (Grenada), the informal group on low-GWP alternatives to ODS met briefly on Thursday afternoon.\nExplaining that he had consulted with several parties, Co-Chair Horisberger introduced a draft decision requesting the TEAP to “review and update the report pursuant to decision XXI/9 and to provide a draft report to OEWG-31 and final report at MOP-23,” and the informal group agreed to it. The group also agreed to a draft factual report on its work, which stated the group’s decision to continue discussions at OEWG-31.\nIN THE CORRIDORS\nAs the high-level segment launched on Thursday with colorful Thai dancers, many delegates were absent from the plenary hall, instead convening in parallel to resolve outstanding issues still facing the contact groups. In reference to this apparent diligence, some delegates were left questioning: to what end? Despite lengthy deliberations in several groups, square brackets still remained for key issues, and some delegates left for the evening cultural reception wondering if their work over the week would lead to resolution of many (or any) significant issues.\nENB SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS: The Earth Negotiations Bulletin summary and analysis of MOP-22 will be available on Monday, 15 November 2010 online at: http://enb.iisd.org/ozone/mop22/\nThis issue of the Earth Negotiations Bulletin © <email@example.com> is written and edited by Melanie Ashton, Kate Harris, Tallash Kantai, Kate Neville, and Kunbao Xia.

{"id": "7224", "text": "Depending on your preferences, choosing the right brand can be an important aspect of writing with fountain pens. Every fountain pen brand has something unique and different to offer. When it comes to Japanese brand Platinum, you can expect nothing short of excellence. With their high-quality nibs and extra fine writing instruments, Platinum promises a great writing experience that you will surely enjoy. However, not every fountain pen from Platinum delivers in the same way. Here, we’ve listed our top picks for the best pens in their line-up, from the most accessible and affordable options to some of their more premium selections.\nThe 3776 Century is arguably Platinum's most popular pen in its current line-up. It is often recommended by fountain pen enthusiasts and is a mainstay at pen shows as well as carried by most retailers. Similar to favorites from other brands, such as the Pelikan M400 and the Montblanc Meisterstück Classique, Platinum’s 3776 Century is a good-sized pen with a lightweight cartridge-converter filling system that feels great in the hand.\nThe attractive resin body is paired with a high-quality 14-karat gold nib with a beautiful flared design. Compared to other nibs, the 3776 Century has a bit of feedback that is pleasant for writers who like feeling their pens move across paper. These nibs also come in extra fine and ultra extra fine for a beautifully superb writing experience.\nFor writers who aren’t quite ready to splurge on the 3776 but have a little bit more to spend, the Procyon is a great choice from Platinum. This well-balanced pen feels sturdy and durable in the hand with its aluminum body and brass fixtures.\nWriting with the Procyon is enjoyable as it has a smooth, free-flowing nib that performs well straight out of the box. A medium-sized nib for this pen is a good option to show off ink properties like shading, sheen, and shimmer while staying small enough to use for everyday writing. Many have likened this to an upgraded Platinum Preppy and Platinum Plaisir. They all have swappable nibs that perform well, but the difference lies in the quality of the rest of the pen’s build. For this reason, we’ve chosen the Procyon for our list. It’s a good-looking pen that feels great, perfect for fountain pen enthusiasts who prefer metal-bodied pens without breaking the budget.\nBeginner-friendly pens these days are very high-quality, and the Platinum Preppy is no exception. For under $10, you get a cartridge-compatible fountain pen with a very smooth writing nib. Many competitors at this price point are not designed to be refilled, so this is a plus for the Preppy.\nThe body of the pen feels lightweight and easy to use. The barrel is translucent and made of PC resin for a sturdier build. The nib on this pen can also be swapped with pens like the Plaisir and the Prefounte for more variety. It writes smoothly, with no scratchiness whatsoever, zero tooth, and minimal feedback, so if you are a fan of a smoother, glassier writing experience, this pen is a great, very affordable option to have.\nThe Bottom Line\nPlatinum has set a high standard for fine writing at all price points. Whether you’re on a budget or ready to invest in an excellent fountain pen, this brand has high-quality options for you. It is helpful to know what the best nib sizes are for fountain pens so that you can choose the right Platinum pen for you. Remember that Japanese pens tend to write finer lines than their European or American counterparts, and the same goes for Platinum. That said, you’ll certainly enjoy the exceptional fountain pens produced by this brand.\nWritten by EndlessPens Blogger Ramona Kabigting", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

Science and technology behind vinegrowing and wine.\nAnd to a large extent. It could be said that they have been present in vinegrowing and wine since their origin. In each small step forward, in each experiment that makes it possible to cultivate grapevines or make wine differently. In the knowledge acquired and the techniques developed after overcoming the different crises. In each learning experience that has taken us through time to reach the present-day cultivation and winemaking methods.\nThe evolution of the winemaking vats is one example of the advancement of technology over time. Since the time of the Romans up to this present day, a range of materials have been used for the vats, including ceramics, clay, wood and concrete, to finally arrive at stainless steel. Different materials that give different characteristics to the wine but which are also differentiated by the level of automation and control over the fermentation process. While the entire process was carried out by hand in the clay vessels used in Roman times, it is now possible to automate the entire process using the most advanced stainless steel vats now available, from filling to temperature control and sampling.\nA further example of the presence of science and technology in winegrowing and wine arose during the phylloxera crisis. The phylloxera is a small aphid that attacks the roots of the European vines (Vitis vinifera species), causing its decay and even death. Until the second half of the 19th century phylloxera was solely to be found in America, where the relatives of the European grapevine (Vitis berlandieri, Vitis rupestris and Vitis riparia), had co-evolved with it and no great concerns were raised. However, when plants from the American continent were imported into Europe, it caused the destruction of many vineyards. After much despair and a great deal of work, they came up with the solution: take the roots of American vines, that are resistant to phylloxera and join them to the new European grapevines. This is technically termed grafting.\nThis is a never-ending process. We continue to learn and improve on an ongoing basis.\nToday, there are hundreds and thousands of investigators who, day after day, are working around the world to learn more about the grapevine, to make its cultivation more sustainable, to make it able to adapt to a changing environment. Also to continue to improve the quality of the wines, reaching out to a greater number of people, but through a winemaking process that seeks efficiency and respect for its environment.\nLet me show you a clear example.\nThe grape varieties grown at different times in history in a specific region, have not always been the same. Instead, they have changed progressively based on the social, economic and environmental situation of each period. This means that many varieties that were grown some 100 or even 500 years ago are no longer cultivated. However, it is still possible to find plants in ancient vineyards or in former areas where the vineyards that used to be present at an earlier time in history, have now disappeared. Work to recover and preserve those varieties that are at risk of disappearing is being conducted in many places in Europe, including Navarre. But, what's so important about conserving and recovering varieties of this type? Each grapevine variety has its own unique set of genes. This is what is known as a plant genetic resource. That is to say, each variety has some specific characteristics that allow it to cope differently with the stress it is facing, such as extreme climatic conditions or attack by pests or diseases. The availability of a wide range of varieties makes it possible to select the one that best adapts to the specific conditions of the area in question, thereby optimising resources and respecting the environment. This also makes it possible to ensure the availability of varieties that can adapt to the new environmental conditions resulting from climate change and thereby preserve cultivation. Furthermore, new varieties offer the possibility of making new products, increasing the range available for everyone wishing to enjoy a glass of wine.\nIn short, science and technology have and always will be present in the vineyards and in the wineries alike, thereby helping to ensure that vineyards continue to be part of our landscape and that, at the end of the supply chain, as consumers we continue to enjoy a good time with a good glass of wine.", "scores": {"score": 3, "score_transform_1": 5, "score_transform_2": 5, "score_transform_3": 0}}

{"id": "7256", "text": "We investigate the phenomenology of the Randall-Sundrum (RS) radion in realistic models of electroweak symmetry breaking with bulk gauge and fermion fields, since the radion may turn out to be the lightest particle in such models. We calculate the coupling of the radion in such scenarios to bulk fermion and gauge modes. Special attention needs to be devoted to the coupling to massless gauge fields (photon, gluon), since it is well known that loop effects may be important for these fields. We also present a detailed explanation of these couplings from the conformal field theory interpretation. We then use these couplings to determine the radion branching fractions and discuss some of the discovery potential of the LHC for the radion. We find that the γγ signal is enhanced over most of the range of the radion mass over the γγ signal of a standard model Higgs boson, as long as the RS scale is sufficiently low. However, the signal significance depends strongly on free parameters that characterize the magnitude of bare brane-localized kinetic terms for the massless gauge fields. In the absence of such terms, the signal can be enhanced over the traditional RS1 models (where all standard model fields are localized on the IR brane), but the signal can also be reduced compared to RS1 if the brane-localized terms are sizeable. We also show that for larger radion masses, where the γγ signal is no longer significant, one can use the usual 4 lepton signal to discover the radion.\n|Physical Review D - Particles, Fields, Gravitation and Cosmology\n|Published - Dec 20 2007\nASJC Scopus subject areas\n- Nuclear and High Energy Physics\n- Physics and Astronomy (miscellaneous)", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

{"id": "7275", "text": "Spigot and Paper are both versions of Minecraft software, but both have some differences in performing different functions. Paper and Spigot are primarily similar, both of them being server software that helps Bukkit plugin. You should be aware of the essential benefits of using Paper is the significantly improved performance compared to a spigot or craft bukkit server. So which software is better between Paper and Spigot?\nPaper is a far better option than the Spigot. The Paper has more numbers of users with more plugins. Moreover, the Paper has an interactive interface, and it performs better. Well, there are some reasons in favor of the Spigot too. Spigot is optimized to alter the server performance by reducing it.\nWith a view on speed from day one, the Spigot is heavily optimized to reduce and eliminate standard server performance. Still, want to know more about Paper and Spigot? Don’t have any idea about it? No need to worry about it – in this article, we will go through every aspect of Paper and Spigot regarding their usage.\nSo, let’s explore!\nIs Paper A Spigot?\nPaper and Spigot are different regarding their features. Moreover, Paper allows the plugins to work on servers efficiently by adding special qualities on API. Paper always provides help and support to the spigot and Bukkit plugins, whereas spigot never supports paper plugins. This is only because Paper has a more extensive base than Spigot.\nOne of the other essential things that you must know to establish is that Paper is for Spigot. It’s mean that it adds code that was in use by Spigot and will never exist if it was not for the Spigot.\nJust because of this, all the plugins made for the spigot server will also work on a server running paper MC. This is why we know that switching from Spigot to Paper is easy.\nWhat Is The Difference Between Spigot And Paper?\nPaper is mostly more performant in direct comparison to Spigot due to further optimizations present in the server code. It is known as the best feature of Paper that it gives its user control over the Minecraft server, including one more part know as Redstone ( to disable), etc.\nHowever, Paper is different from a spigot due to many reasons. The next difference between Spigot and Paper is that Paper is used by a large number of players. It also has more plugin numbers, and its performance is much better than that of Spigot.\nAnother good point is that it has a V2 timing system. These all features help users see what is happening in the server, and these features are helpful for the user to identify an area of poor performance\nCan You Change From Spigot To Paper?\nPaper works in a way that results in proper replacement for Spigot. In contrast, it still maintains the functionality of all plugins and can also be easily switched by just changing the server type. As with all server changes and modifications, it is highly advisable to take a server backup before making any significant changes to be safe from the risk of any data loss.\nSwitching to Paper will create no issue because we know that Paper is a fork of Spigot. Just change the jar file, and that’s it. Here are some guidelines for switching to Paper.\nSteps for switching to Paper\n- Place that backup somewhere safe and out of the way from the Spigot.\n- Put your paper spigot jar folder into that server directory.\nIs Paper or Spigot faster?\nI know a lot of people plugin docs are saying that Paper is less laggy. Sometimes plugin gives a warning when server startup that running Paper is better .paper also has some sort of significant improvement that results in better performance. As you know, it also has a new version of timing that enables it to find out the reason which slows down your server.Bukkit and spigot APIs are improved by paper.\nThat results in more features and functionality in your hands. Meanwhile, Paper retains compatibility with plugins written for Spigot and Bukkit. Moreover, it is a growing field and the number of developers is increasing rapidly .\nPaper is also known for a high-performance fork of the spigot server that helps fix gaming and mechanic issues and improves performance. A huge range of features from bug fixing to exploit and from performance to improvements- Paper has everything.\nPaper Vs. Spigot, Which One Is Better For You?\nPaper has many benefits over Spigot. One of Paper’s main and important benefits is its significantly more improved performance in contrast to a Spigot. Paper has several changes that speed up many aspects of the game. It’s not possible to give an outstanding performance; however, it’s the quality of Paper to add more players your server can support without slowing down.\nMany other options are available which help or enable you to improve performance at the expense of changing gameplay behavior. Paper Have many important or extraordinary features to the API, permitting plugins to do more different things on the server. Thus, these characteristics not only help in the betterment of performance but also improve the way of its functioning. Due to this quality, many plugins allow using the Paper for improved performance or functionality.\nFurthermore, different plugins are required to use paper permanently. As we know that craft book 5 relies on Paper, many things are impossible for the plugin to do on Spigot. Suppose the plugin shows its function and works on Paper. In this situation, the plugin will not help or support Spigot in any case.\nMoreover, it is essential to know that Paper always supports Spigot and also Bukkit plugin. Whereas Spigot never helps paper plugins, we get to know that Paper has a more extensive base.", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}

{"id": "7282", "text": "The holiday season is a magical time, but Christmas traditions, decor, and celebrations can lead to accidents (or worse) if you’re not careful. Here’s how to keep your family safe and healthy through to the New Year.\n1. Your tree is a fire risk — even if it’s fake.\nEach holiday season, fire departments respond to an average of 210 Christmas tree fires nationally, reports the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA). Tree fires aren’t super common, but when they do happen, they’re more likely to be serious.\nKeep your tree at least three feet away from all heat sources (like fireplaces, radiators, and heat vents). If you have a real tree, remember to keep it watered; the drier the tree, the more easily it could ignite. “Your stand should have a water reservoir that can hold one quart of water per inch of the stem’s diameter,” says Rachel Rothman, the Good Housekeeping Institute’s technical and engineering director. And choose a sturdy stand so the tree won’t tip over.\n2. Don’t overdo it on the lights.\nAs much as you may want to cover every inch of your house with twinklers, you may have to scale back depending on your outlets. Check the lights’ packaging for the power output and never plug in more than what a power strip or outlet says it can handle. “You never want to connect more than three strings of lights in one series,” says Rothman.\nAlways look for the UL symbol when buying electrical items and pay attention to its color: Green means it’s approved for indoor use, and red means it can be used indoors and outdoors. If you’re using old lights, check the wires to make sure there are no signs of fraying or cracking. Even if you’ve followed all of these precautions, you should still unplug all indoor lights when you leave the house. Yes, even the ones on your tree in the bay window.\n3. Candles are pretty, but they’re still open flames.\nDecember is the peak time of year for candle-related house fires, says the NFPA. Sure, they set a glowy holiday mood, but lit flames and Christmas decorations don’t exactly mix. In one five-year study, the NFPA found that 52% of decoration-related fires were started by candles.\nKeep lit candles at least 12 inches away from surrounding objects. Trim wicks to a quarter of an inch before you light them and only let candles burn for one hour for every inch of diameter, so the wax can melt evenly. So, if you have a three-inch candle, it shouldn’t burn for more than three hours.\nAnd never leave lit candles in a room that’s unattended. “The bathroom is particularly worrisome because people go in and out, and hand towels get moved around a lot,” says Carolyn Forte, director of the Cleaning Lab at the GHI.\n4. Never toss anything but logs into your fireplace.\n“Don’t try to burn evergreens or wreaths in a fireplace or wood stove,” says Amy Artuso, program manager for the National Safety Council. Greenery and tree needles burn much faster than logs, creating sparks, which can fly into the room or onto the roof. They can also cause a build-up of creosote, a highly flammable compound, in the chimney. “And don’t burn wrapping paper, because it can contain metallic materials that could be hazardous to breathe in,” says Artuso.\nMake sure the fire is out and the embers have cooled before you leave the house or go to bed. Put the ashes in a metal bin that’s at least 25 feet away from the house. “And have a professional come out at least once a year to inspect the chimney,” Forte adds.\n5. Don’t be sloppy with broken ornaments.\nKnown for your butter fingers? If you drop a glass ornament and it breaks, pick up the big pieces and wrap them in newspaper or a paper towel before throwing them in the garbage, says Forte. “You can use a moist piece of white bread to pick up the little shards,” she adds. Then, sweep the space and go over it with a vacuum cleaner.\nPay extra attention to floors this time of year — even if you haven’t just broken something. With guests coming-and-going and a surplus of decor you don’t typically display, you may not notice something on the floor. “Be on the lookout for loose ornament hooks and sweep up fallen tree needles as often as you can,” Forte suggests. Debris could cause slips and falls, and pets and little kids might end up playing with (or worse, eating) stuff they shouldn’t be.\n6. Festive favorites can seriously harm your pets.\nA cat might see shiny tinsel as a toy, but a single strand can become tangled in his intestines, causing serious damage. Holly, mistletoe, and poinsettias are toxic to dogs and cats when ingested. And as for candy canes (the real ones, not the dog-toy variety), their curvy shape and wrapper can be a choking hazard, and sugar-free ones made with xylitol are poisonous to dogs.\n7. Banish any slippery spots.\nIn all the rush, don’t forget to prep the outside of your house. Keep your driveway and walkways clear of ice and snow, especially if you’re expecting guests. For quick work, our GHI experts recommend Morton Fast Action Ice Melt.\nAnd be extra careful as you’re shoveling your property: Roughly 16,500 Americans head to the hospital each year due to injuries that happen while shoveling or removing ice and snow, according to the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission. Wear proper boots with enough traction, point feet slightly outward to keep your center of balance under you, and take small, slow steps.\n8. Not all toys work for all kids.\nKeep all the kids in mind when selecting gifts. “People tend to focus on what’s age-appropriate for one specific child, but younger children always want to play with the toys that the older kids get,” Artuso points out. This could be problematic if an older kid’s toy comes with lots of little parts. In 2013, there were an estimated 256,700 toy-related injuries treated in U.S. hospital emergency rooms, according to the CPSC. In the GHI, we only recommend toys that have been vetted for safety checks and are compliant with government regulations.\n9. Remember to secure the house.\nIf you’re headed out of town for an extended period of time, you should do more than just lock up. “Tell neighbors you trust that you’re going away and have them keep an eye out,” says Forte. “Have your post office stop your mail and put lights — inside and outside — on timers, so they go on and off at random times during the night.”", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}

Can you upload your project file so we can help you better?\nWeird, I don’t experiencing the problem\nWhatever I do, the character never end up in the air.\nWhat I was doing is to exported the project and run index.html from the folder, select the character on the left side and I can jump, punch and move left and right without any problem even after punch. Tested in Internet Explorer and Firefox, no such problem here.\nCould you tell me exactly what to do to reproduce the problem?\nRegarding image size, always ideal if the images of animation are the same size and the origin and center points are also at the same position for each animation of the object.\nHey thanks for the reply.\nThe problem was when the character gets hit with the ice thing her hurt animation makes her end up in the falling animation in one quick motion.\nI ended up starting to make a new character with the same size and I ended up with the same problem. I’ll try with you said about the points and make sure they are in the same exact mid point.\nI got it to work according to your post but now I’m having this problem:\nIn picture one, the character isn’t on the ground\nbut in the second picture the character is.\nSo its whenever I move across the stage she looks like she’s walking up a ramp.\nI’ll upload the files for the new problem.\nThe file got bigger so i’ll post a link:\nCan any one help?\nIs it occurs with all characters, or only with the one on the picture?\nDo you using the same center and origin point for each character?\nI meant to use the same points for each animation of the character and same image size for each frame of the animation.\nCould you please upload your project as it is on your hard drive, including (sub)directories?\nI’m too lazy to set the location for every sprite on my hdd\nI guess, you have everything in one directory, just pack the whole thing up, so I can open the project in GD and ready to run a preview.\nIf you don’t want to share the whole project with all your sprites and sounds, I suggest to make every part one by one in a test project first, if it works, you can easily implement it in to your main project, if it not, you can share only that part where you got the problem and also easier to find the source of the problem.\nAlso, if you want to add something new to an earlier post, (especially if it a question) I suggest to write a new post, as editing is not indicated. I don’t know about others, but normally I’m open topics only If a new post is indicated.\nThanks for the reply.\nI did center all of the sprites with the new character like you said now everything is working well.\nMy only problem is the weird lump in the middle of the stage.\nI made the floor into a drag-able object to see what would happen but I’m confused on the results.\nI believe the new character is the problem because it only happens with her.\nThe characters I’m using are only placeholders.\nI want to figure out how to fix it just in case i run into it into the future.\nI’ll re-upload the Pictures/sprites paths.", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}
{"id": "7312", "text": "Auto stocks have really pulled the brakes in recent years, thanks in part to macro headwinds and the threat of a looming economic contraction. Indeed, when times are good, the auto stocks tend to roll higher, only to roll downhill at the first signs of subtle economic weakness.\nThe booms and busts of the auto industry are really nothing new. And though many beginner investors may shy away from the economically oversensitive sector, I’d argue that it makes a ton of sense to bet a net buyer when times are bad, and a recession or slowdown is already on the radar of everybody on Wall or Bay Street.\nRemember, the bad economic days do not last forever. And oftentimes, the level of fear tends to overswing to the downside. Of course, bad times can always get worse. But it’s always darkest before the bottom is put in and the new bull run kicks off!\nI have no idea how hard the next downturn will hit. But I see quite a bit of turbulence in the broader auto scene. Braving a falling knife can be detrimental to one’s health, but if the valuation makes sense, I think initiating a long-term position may prove wise. That is, if you’re willing to endure a bumpy ride with the autos!\nLet’s check out three autos that I think are underpriced.\nMagna International (TSX:MG) is a Canadian auto part maker that will live to see better days once the auto sector is ready to rev its engines again (pardon the pun, folks!). The move toward electric vehicles (EV) is one that will be going on through the next decade.\nOf course, downturns could cause many consumers to put off upgrading to an EV. But once the tides turn, I think Magna and other firms pivotal to the auto industry will be in a spot to surge higher, perhaps at a staggering rate, once we have more evidence that the economy is headed for a soft-ish type of landing.\nAnything rougher than a soft landing, though, and Magna stock could continue to feel the hit. The stock’s already down over 40% from its 2021 high, however. With a nice 3.4% dividend yield, I view Magna as worth riding out until the road smoothens. The recent quarterly beat is encouraging, but the firm needs to put up another few before it can sustain a rally past its mid- to high $80 ceiling of resistance.\nIt’s been a choppy ride for Elon Musk’s EV firm Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), in recent years. Recent action in shares is enough to make all but the bravest investors a bit carsick. At 75.7 times trailing price to earnings, the EV kingpin isn’t all absurdly priced if you view it as a tech company with a specialty in artificial intelligence (AI) and a front-row seat to the self-driving future.\nEither way, Elon Musk is a genius, and he’s more than worth paying up for. Just how much is too much? That’s the big question. I’d argue Tesla’s fortunes course turn in a hurry once auto demand picks up again. As such, I’d be ready to nibble my way into the stock gradually over time.\nBefore you consider Tesla, you’ll want to hear this.\nOur market-beating analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 5 best stocks for investors to buy in November 2023… and Tesla wasn’t on the list.\nThe online investing service they’ve run for nearly a decade, Motley Fool Stock Advisor Canada, is beating the TSX by 24 percentage points.

{"id": "7357", "text": "Effective Recycling Tips for Industrial Metal Recycling\nManagers of large industrial complexes, face the daily challenge of dealing with tons of metal waste. This issue is significant and requires effective management and recycling. Fortunately, by implementing the right strategies and techniques, you can not only reduce this waste but also turn it into a profitable venture. Let’s explore how you can make this a reality in your operations. You might be surprised by the answers.\nTo start, consider implementing a comprehensive waste management plan. This plan should include strategies for reducing waste at the source, such as improving production processes and implementing efficient material usage practices. By doing so, you can minimize waste generation right from the beginning.\nNext, focus on maximizing the recycling potential of the metal waste. Establish a system for sorting and segregating different types of metals. This will enable you to recycle each metal type effectively, ensuring that you extract the maximum value from the waste. Additionally, consider investing in advanced recycling technologies that can optimize the recycling process and increase the quality of recycled materials.\nCollaboration is vital when it comes to industrial scrap metal recycling. Partner with reputable recycling companies that specialize in handling and processing metal waste. These companies have the expertise and facilities to efficiently recycle the waste and transform it into valuable resources. By working together, you can ensure that the waste is handled responsibly and sustainably.\nExplore innovative recycling methods that can extract valuable materials from the metal waste. These materials can be used in various industries, such as construction, automotive, and electronics. By finding new applications for the recycled materials, you can create additional revenue streams and enhance the overall profitability of your operations.\nUnderstanding Different Types of Scrap Metal\nWhen it comes to scrap metal, it’s important to understand and separate different types. This includes ferrous metals like steel and iron, as well as non-ferrous metals such as aluminum, copper, and brass. Recognizing these distinctions not only helps with efficient recycling but also increases the value and appeal of the scrap to companies. Your knowledge of the different types of scrap can have a significant impact on your profits.\nScrap Metal Separation and Preparation Techniques\nSeparation and preparation techniques play a key role in boosting the value of your scrap metal. Learn and implement these techniques to maximize your potential profit. By identifying and separating different types of scrap metal waste, you simplify the recycling process and increase its efficiency.\nTo begin with, you need to separate your scrap metal by type. Metals can be classified as ferrous or non-ferrous, each with its own recycling process and market value. You can easily distinguish between the two by using a magnet. If the magnet sticks, it’s ferrous metal.\nPreparation is key to ensuring the quality of your scrap metal. Cleaning the metal and removing non-metal parts such as plastic or rubber is crucial to prevent contamination. Additionally, cleaning the metal to remove grease, dirt, and rust can significantly increase its recyclability and value.\nProper storage of your scrap metal is equally important. Protect it from exposure to elements that can cause damage or degradation. By taking this precaution, you maintain the condition of the metal and preserve its value.\nSelecting the Right Recycling Partner\nChoosing the Right Recycling Partner is a vital step to get the most out of your scrap metal. Look for an accredited company that specializes in scrap metal recycling. Local scrap yards could be an option, but make sure they comply with environmental standards and have the necessary equipment for recycling. Your chosen partner should be able to handle the complexities of waste reduction and recycling. They should reduce your workload and minimize environmental impacts, protecting your company’s image. They should also have knowledge about current market prices for scrap metals, allowing you to negotiate better offers from buyers. Your recycling partner should be more than just a metal recycling facility. They need to adhere to regulations, support sustainability initiatives, and invest in proper equipment and staff training for handling scrap metal. This ensures efficient recycling at competitive pricing, maximizing your return.\nHow Do You Recycle Industrial Metal Waste? To recycle industrial scrap metal, start by separating waste, conducting scrap metal audits, and composting organics. Make sure to handle hazardous waste and electronic waste responsibly. Use approved facilities for disposal and ensure compliance with all environmental regulations.\nHow Can Metal Waste Be Reduced? To cut down on metal waste, you can implement sustainable and lean manufacturing processes. Try substituting materials, conducting waste audits, and applying eco-design principles. It’s all about making smarter choices, rather than simply recycling more.\nWhat Is the Most Profitable Metal to Recycle? Recycling aluminum is your best choice if you want to make a profit. It is a highly sought-after metal that commands good prices, and the recycling process for aluminum is energy efficient. Keep in mind that scrap metal pricing and profitability can be influenced by market fluctuations and regulations.\nGreenway Metal Recycling- your partner in scrap!\nTransform your industrial scrap metal waste into profit and contribute to a sustainable future with Greenway Metal Recycling.

{"id": "7358", "text": "Camera Types Used Today For Digital Media Creation\nA DSLR camera is a digital single-lens reflex camera. It uses a mirror and prism system to direct light from the lens to the viewfinder, which allows you to see what the lens sees. The system is called “reflex” because the image seen in the viewfinder is reflected off of a mirror and into your eye. DSLR cameras also have a large sensor that allows for more detail and better low-light performance than other digital cameras. This type of camera is also capable of capturing video footage.\nA few different DSLR camera brands are popular among academics and photography enthusiasts alike. Canon and Nikon are two of the most well-known brands, and they offer a range of DSLR cameras that vary in price, features, and quality. I still have a Canon 60D that is a little dated now but still is used with great results. Other popular DSLR camera brands include Sony, Fujifilm, Panasonic, and Olympus. Each brand has its strengths and weaknesses, so it’s important to do your research before purchasing a DSLR camera.\nA mirrorless camera is a type of digital single-lens reflex camera that does not have an optical viewfinder; instead of using an electronic viewfinder (EVF). This design offers a number of advantages, including the ability to see exactly what the lens sees, as well as preview exposure and depth of field effects. Mirrorless cameras are also typically smaller and lighter than traditional DSLRs. These cameras are also good for video capture.\nSony, Panasonic, and Fujifilm are popular mirrorless camera brands. I own a Fuji X-T3 mirrorless camera and love the results I get and bought it because of its analog controls and great digital ones. Canon and Nikon have also moved into the market and offer several good choices.\nFull Frame Cameras\nA full-frame camera is a camera that has a sensor that is the same size as a frame of 35mm film. This means that the sensor is much larger than the sensors in most other digital cameras, which can lead to better quality images. Full frame cameras are generally more expensive than other digital cameras but can also produce higher-quality images. The benefit of using a full-frame sensor is that the photographer can use any lens without having to worry about crop factor.\nThere are a few full-frame camera brands that are more popular than others. Some of these brands include Canon, Nikon, and Sony. I have a Canon 5D which was released around 2006. Although it doesn’t have video capabilities, it is still a fantastic portrait and landscape camera. Each release of cameras in the 5D line up to the 5D Mark IV came with improved video features and sensor improvements. In addition, Canon is known for its color science in it its sensors. The original 5D has colors that are unique to its sensor that I love.\nWhile there are other brands that offer full-frame cameras, these three tend to be the most popular. This is likely because they have a large selection of lenses available and a variety of features suited for different types of photographers.\nLarge Format Mirrorless Digital Cameras\nA large-format mirrorless digital camera is a digital camera that uses a large format sensor. Professional photographers often prefer this type of camera because of its high image quality and low noise levels.\nNikon and Canon are the two most popular large-format camera brands on the market. They offer a wide variety of features, options, and quality performance. Both brands have a strong following among professional photographers, and their cameras are often used for commercial and high-end photography applications. In addition, Fuji released a popular full-frame called the GFX100 that is known for its in-body stabilization and wide format 4K/30p motion capture.\nSmart Phone Choices For Digital Media Creation\nThere are a number of different factors to consider when making a decision about which smartphone to purchase for use in creating digital media. One important consideration is the type of camera that the phone has. Some phones have excellent cameras that can take high-quality photos and videos. In contrast, others have cameras that are more limited in their capabilities. Another factor to consider is the size of the phone’s screen and the included software.\nThere are many types of Smart Phones on the market, but the most popular brands are Apple, Samsung, and LG. These phones are popular because they have many features that other phones do not have, such as large screens, high-resolution cameras, and powerful processors. But, unfortunately, they are also very expensive.\nSome Nice to Know Information When Buying a Camera\nWhat is Crop Factor?\nA camera’s crop factor is a measure of its field of view (FOV) compared to a “full-frame” sensor. A camera with a crop factor of 2 would have a FOV that is half that of a camera with a full-frame sensor. Crop factors are often expressed in terms of fractions, such as 1.5 or 2.7. This number is derived by dividing the diagonal measurement of the image sensor by the diagonal size of a full-frame sensor.\nFull Frame versus Cropped-Sensor Cameras\nA full-frame camera sensor is one that is the same size as a 35mm film frame. This means that the sensor is 36mm wide and 24mm high. When compared to cropped-sensor cameras, full-frame sensors provide superb image quality and detail because they have larger pixels. However, they are also more expensive.\nVideo Camera Choices\nA few different types of cameras are popular for video creation.

Its main purpose is to protect clothing elements from getting fat and other contaminants. Of course, in the era of rapid development of scientific and technological progress with its microwave ovens, pressure cookers and food processors, the use of an apron is not so important. However, if you sew it yourself, it completely changes the case, and you yourself will not notice how you will wear it in the kitchen all the time. To sew an apron for the kitchen, stock up on the following tools and materials:\n- white thread;\n- 4 sections of fabric 45x12 centimeters (one of them will need to cut strips in colors A, B, C, D);\n- 4-square 13x13 centimeters of color D (gray and yellow strip in the illustration);\n- 2 sections of material 112х9 centimeters of color Г (a strip of gray and yellow in the illustration);\n- Two square cuts 13x13 centimeters of color G;\n- sharp scissors or rotary cutter;\n- a cut of cloth 94x45 centimeters (for a skirt) of color B (in an illustration gray with ethnic circles);\n- cut material 97x23 centimeters (for the belt) of color B (in the illustration, yellow with ethnic circles).\nWe make the design of the details-rays. Naturally, shades of fabrics you can pick upon your own. Before starting work, it is recommended to create a kind of trapezoid pattern from thick paper, the sides of which are 11.5 centimeters in height. Using it, you need to cut 20 similar elements. Fold each element twice with a face upward and stitch along the top, retreating to the seam of 0.6 centimeters. The main thing is to correctly execute the first element, while others will do even easier. We collect appliqués. We fasten the elements and cut off the corners with scissorsside, which is folded, only so as not to touch the seam. We turn out all the elements and iron it well. Then we arrange the colored elements in the order of their sewing, which you define yourself. Sew them with a seam allowance of 0.6 centimeters. The order of formation of applications: Ready-made appliance Fold and ironall shovchiki. We take two square cuts of shades G and D, we smooth them well. A cut from pieces of circles with a diameter of 11.5 centimeters. 2 circles folded twice and ironed. The applications are almost done, so we will postpone them for a while to the side. Let's go to sewing an apron skirt. We take a cut of material 94x45 centimeters, bend the bottom from both sides, having pinched the edge 0.6 centimeters inside and iron it. The applications are almost done, so we will postpone them for a while to the side. Take the cut of material 94x45 centimeters, bendbottom on both sides, having pinched the edges 0.6 centimeter inside and ironing. The gate is fixed with the help of pins. Stitch along the line of the folded inner and outer edges. You should get a double stitch. After this comes the turn of the pockets. Placing a pocket on the skirt. We fold twice the skirt and iron it, creating for this time the central axis. Place on one side of the pocket below 8 centimeters from the central axis and fix it with pins. In the middle of the pocket we fold one of the circles twice inside and iron well heated with an iron, thus creating a pocket. We make a pocket on the apron. Straight stitches, gently round the two applications, and the pockets are ready. We form the central fold. From the smoothed central axis in 7-8 centimeters we take a cut and we conduct from a line to the middle, making a fold. Now it needs ironing and fastening with the help of pins. Similarly do from the other side. Create a crease on the skirt The fold is done. We turn to sewing a belt on the apron. The cut of the material 97x23 centimeters must be bent from four sides and ironed. Next, you need to bend it twice along the long side and iron it well on the edge. We fix the belt and the skirt with each other with pins. Then you should stitch the edge of the skirt and secure, with the help of pins, the edge of the fold. The two sides of the belt should remain open. Now you need to sew on our apron belt. Next, we make ties to the apron, for which a 112 x 9 centimeter cut is used. Slightly bending the edges, you need to iron them, then fold them twice and stitch along the outer edge next to it. Each string is inserted into a separate gap, which we left on the belt, fixed with pins and double-stitched. After that, you should sew the ties to the kitchen apron and it's ready. You can wear it with pleasure.", "scores": {"score": 3, "score_transform_1": 5, "score_transform_2": 5, "score_transform_3": 0}}

I personally don’t associate the saxophone with swear words, but hey, each to their own….\nIrrespective of the phrasing, what I have found surprising is how often and how regularly people from all over the world are thinking about learning how to play the saxophone.\nThis is fantastic !!\nI have been engaging in conversations with some of these people, which has also been interesting and lots of fun.\nSome people are just flippantly tweeting random thoughts that they really have no intention for or idea about. A bit like a certain President whose overuse of Twitter is well known.\nOther people are actually, genuinely, wanting to play the saxophone. By writing it down and making it public they are hoping to get one step closer towards what has honestly been a goal of theirs for some time now.\nIn some cases, these people have wanted to learn how to play the saxophone for decades. Some played it when they were at school 15/20/25/30/35/40 years ago and want to pick it back up again.\nOthers have seen cool photos or videos of sexy looking musicians wielding a sax and think that they want to live that dream too.\nYet others just want to learn saxophone for the pure joy of either making music or learning something new, or both.\nIt would appear that most of these people are male. Why is that ?\nI don’t recall anyone ever saying, “nice girls don’t play saxophone”….!?!\nMaybe it’s just the men who announce their thoughts on Twitter ? Just as many women actually play saxophone as men….\nAnyway, obviously I’m biased, but I think learning how to play the saxophone is a WONDERFUL idea !!\nPerhaps you are a baby boomer who wants to learn saxophone ?\nYou are approaching retirement, you’ve worked hard, you’ve raised a family, you’ve got a bit of disposable income, you are looking for a new hobby to get stuck into, you’re still open to new ideas and want a challenge.

You have personal plus professional plus financial responsibilities. You may or may not hate your job, but you need to keep going. And you’re stressed.\nYou have very little time for yourself. Now is the time to be just a teeny tiny little bit selfish and do something for yourself that you’ve always wanted to do…..and learning saxophone is near the top of your “want list” ?\nMaybe you are a school student (or a parent of a school student) who wants to learn saxophone ?\nPerhaps you are in a rural or remote area or perhaps you don’t have any saxophone teachers within a reasonable travelling distance of where you live. Perhaps your school does not offer saxophone lessons. Home school students want to learn saxophone as much as regular school students do ! Or perhaps sax lessons with a one-on-one teacher are a bit out of the preferred budget and price range. Online saxophone lessons are a fantastic way to learn saxophone !\nRetirees LOVE to learn saxophone.\nYou have retired and you now have plenty of time on your hands. You probably have a little bit of cash set aside for some small and maybe even not-so-small luxuries.\nBuy or ride a Harley Davidson motorcycle – check.

Luckily, in new hampshire, there are ways to get the coverage you need without breaking the bank. Here are some tips on how to save on your new hampshire car insurance premiums today.\nIf you have multiple insurance policies, such as home and auto, consider bundling them with the same company. Many insurers offer discounts for purchasing multiple policies, which can help you save some money. By bundling policies, you may be eligible for a discount of up to 25% on your premiums.\nYour insurance deductible is the amount you pay out of pocket before your insurance kicks in. Consider increasing your deductible to lower your premium. However, make sure you can afford to pay the higher deductible if you do get into an accident.\nA higher deductible can mean significant savings on your insurance premiums.\nDiscounts For Good Drivers\nMost insurance companies offer discounts to drivers who have a clean driving record. That means no accidents or moving violations in the past few years. Additionally, you may be eligible for discounts if you take a defensive driving course. It never hurts to inquire with your insurance provider about these discounts.\nConsider A Smaller Car\nThe make and model of your car can play a significant role in the cost of your insurance premiums. Consider purchasing a smaller car if you’re in the market for a new vehicle. Smaller cars tend to be cheaper to insure because they come with a lower risk of damage in an accident and are less likely to be stolen.\nMost insurance companies offer monthly payment plans, but these usually come with a fee. Consider paying your premiums annually to avoid those fees and get a discount on your policy. By paying annually, you can save up to 10% on your premiums.\nSafe Driving Habits\nYour driving habits can directly impact your insurance premiums. By consistently practicing safe driving habits, such as following posted speed limits, avoiding distractions while driving, and avoiding aggressive driving, you can maintain a clean driving record and potentially lower your insurance rates over time.\nThe best way to ensure that you’re getting the best deal on your new hampshire car insurance premiums is to shop around. Get quotes from multiple insurers to compare rates and find the one that offers the best coverage at the lowest price.\nLetting your car insurance lapse can be costly, as the longer you go without coverage, the higher your premiums will be when you decide to renew. Keep your insurance active by paying your premiums on time and staying insured.\nAvoid Unnecessary Coverage\nWhile it’s important to have adequate coverage, consider dropping any coverage that you don’t need. For example, if your car is paid off, you may not need collision coverage. Take a look at your policy and determine whether there are any coverages you can do away with to save money.\nWork With Independent Agents\nConsider working with an independent insurance agent instead of a captive agent. Independent agents can offer policies from multiple insurers, which can give you more options for finding the best coverage at the lowest price.\nBy implementing these tips, you can save money on your new hampshire car insurance premiums without sacrificing the coverage you need. Remember to shop around, practice safe driving habits, and stay insured to maintain your low rates.\nFrequently Asked Questions Of New Hampshire Car Insurance\nWhat Is Required For Car Insurance In Nh?\nTo legally operate a vehicle in nh, you must have liability insurance.

I’d been trying to plot nearby photo locations to shoot at and as soon as I arrived I knew we really wouldn’t be needing any. The location was simply perfect.\nThis Tasmanian elopement had everything… incredible handwritten vows, beautiful cliff top ceremony, tears.. so many tears. (Myself included)\nHorses, smoke bombs, a first dance in the middle of a field to some B.B King classics and a fire on the beach were just a few of the highlights… Oh did I mention sparklers in an outdoor bath to end the night?! Joel & Bec picked a perfect off the grid venue. Just a few hours out of Hobart to bunker down for a few days with their absolute nearest and dearest after road tripping down from Newcastle in their van, ‘the Gus Bus,’ with their young baby boy with them the whole trip.\nThalia Haven is perhaps the perfect location in Tasmania to have a beautiful elopement.

{"id": "7483", "text": "Step 1: Sign up and Registration\nStep 2: Setting Up : Settings\nAfter the walkthrough; click on the top-left three-bar icon. On the side panel, click on settings to get started to customize your account as per your business needs:\nIn the settings tab, you’ll get ample options to customize the settings as what suits your business best.\nLet’s go over them one-by-one.\nPreferences offer a range of settings that are responsible for maintaining a swift workflow- relating to data and display.\nWhat is a mission and what is a task?\nLet’s understand this by example-\nIf you’re a builder and take up building a house as your project, it would involve varied jobs to be done on-site- construction, power, plumbing, etc. In this scenario, Building the House is your mission and plumbing is a task within the mission.\n1.4 Date Time Format:\n1.5 Distance Unit: Distance Unit settings accommodate for the units that the distance covered will be displayed in. Currently, users can select from among Kilometers or Miles.\nTookan also provides for a distance rounding off option; upon selecting which the distance will be rounded off to the nearest whole number for both miles and kilometers.\n1.6 Customer Data Protection: When a task is listed, you will have access to all of the customer’s information on your dashboard. You can choose whether or not this information will be available to the Agent or Merchant.\nWhen the switch is toggled right, it means that customer data protection is turned on.\n1.7 Tracking Link Settings: When a task is listed on the Tookan App, the customer receives a tracking link to keep tabs on the status of their delivery. Tracking link settings enable you to:\n1.8 Auto Allocation Settings: The feature allows you to enable allocation settings at a team level, further enabling Managers to override settings for their teams- if only they’re provided permission to do so in the Manager’s profile section.\n1.9 Geofence Settings:\nDo not forget to click on the update button to save the changes you make in the preferences\nThis is where the administrator sets up his/her own profile. The first fold on the screen appears as follows asking for information to set up a profile:\nOnce you’ve filled in the above form, click update.\nChange Language: The Change Language Feature is available for both- The Dashboard and The Tracking Panel.\nTookan offers 28 Languages for both Dashboard and Tracking Panel to serve businesses globally, localizing the entire user journey thereof.\nA basic password reset option to change the password, you must know the current password to make the change.\nExercise Your Rights:\nNOTE: Why is it important to fill in the address?\nFor some tasks, the address itself may serve as a task start location. Thus, for accurate route optimization, it is important that you fill in the address.\nClick Create Custom to get started.\nThese notifications can be customized as your business needs.\nHow to add a Task Pricing and Agent Earning Rule:\nUse Existing Templates: Choose from pre-existing templates from the Tookan backend.\nClick Add from Library to get started.\nFor instance: If you’re administering a beauty business, you may create a field in the template that requires the stylist to take pictures of products before the service starts. At a later stage, if the customer provides feedback, or asks for details about the product used, you’ll have the data at bay to provide the requisite information.\nYou can also add multiple templates for multiple business types on the same Tookan admin dashboard.\nDifferent templates can be used for different teams, businesses and geofences.\nGeofence allows you to categorize agent and simplifies the process of task assignment by letting you create virtual boundaries on the map. You can add a particular team/agent to a particular geofence, or add an agent to multiple geofences.\nWith Geofences enabled and in place, you can divide teams, devise pricing logics based on a geofence, aggregate offerings for the location and so on. Basically, geofences equip you to design your entire business offering for an area. …\nCREATING A GEOFENCE\nThe saved Geofence will then reflect in the Geofences list in the Geofence tab. As an admin, you can Edit or Delete the Geofence at any point.\nNOTE: Be careful while marking the geofence on the map, particularly overlapping. In case the geofence overlaps, the task will be randomly assigned to any agent in the overlapping area.\n5.4 Round Robin: Round Robin is the means of equal distribution of work where service providers are considered employees in the team. Everyone gets assigned an equal number of tasks by means of forceful allocation. However, these tasks can only be assigned to full-time employees and not freelancers.\nFor instance: If there are three agents within the defined radius, Agent A and B have two tasks each, while Agent C has only 1, he/she will automatically be assigned the next incoming task.\n5.5 Nearest Available: The allocation by Nearest Available force assigns the task to an agent-based on availability and distance from the task start location. These too cannot be force assigned to a freelancer but only a full-time employee.\nTo put simply, if an agent is present close to the location where the task has to begin from, Tookan will automatically assign the task to that particular agent, UNLESS he/she’s unavailable. In that case, the task will be force assigned to the next closest agent.\nMAKE DEFAULT FOR ALL TEAMS: if you wish to apply the same allocation logic to all working teams, click on “make default for all teams”.\nFreelancer tab allows you to add third-party service providers on your platform and share all the jobs with them on the platform window.\nFor example, If you have a salon and your hairstylist is not available for service on the day, you can share the requirements for the time period with your freelancers and never miss out on a business opportunity.\nThe Freelancers module is more popular in service-driven industries.\nSubscription Plans for Freelancers:\nTookan offers multiple subscription plans for Freelancers that they can opt for, based on how many tasks they wish to do.\nYou can create these plans for freelancers to choose from. Click on create a plan, the following form appears.\nEnter the details as asked and click create.\nThese plans will then be available to Freelancers to choose from and work upon.\nWhy Subscription Plans?\nSubscription Plans work as a key model of operations for Freelancers. Freelancers usually work for more than one client at one point in time. In this scenario, freelancers get the liberty to choose a plan according to their availability; for instance, a hairstylist may have scope for taking only 4 appointments a day and can, therefore, choose a plan that gives him the relevant workload over the period of a month.\nUnder the Teams tab, you can organize all your agents into logical groups/teams to efficiently manage your field operations.\nThese teams may be made on the basis of geography, location, service type, and more.\nAll the teams that you add will be shown here under the teams tab in a grid view making it easier to sort, edit or delete teams.\nNOTE: One person cannot be added to multiple teams.\nStep 4: Agent\nStep 5: Merchants\nStep 6: Customers\nStep 7: Analytics\nStep 8: Extensions\nExtensions serve as third-party integration and utility apps that you can add to your tookan account for smoother workflow in the business. These are both available paid and free.\nStep 9: Support\nTookan takes customer service into serious consideration. And thus, with a single click of a button you can access customer support 24*7 in an easy chat support. We’ve been understood as the fastest in issue resolution and service.\nEnjoy your journey!\nUnderstanding Your Dashboard\nEnsure on-time deliveries with real-time route optimization and end-to-end delivery tracking", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}
{"id": "7487", "text": "In the late 20th century, the women of country music were charting a path of progress toward parity with their male counterparts and then things began to go backward.\nThe 2019 Country Music Awards (CMA) was a Hollywood script with the title “Gender Equality in Country Music.” Reba McEntire, Dolly Parton, and Carrie Underwood hosted the event, and women took home awards for the Best New Artist, Album, and Music Video. Jenee Fleenor made history by becoming the first woman to be named Best Musical Artist. Country’s often-tagged “bro culture” looked to be besting Hollywood as a media showcase for advancing gender equality.\nLike many scripts, this one was a fiction. While country music has gained in popularity with the increasing presence of female stars, the country music industry seems determined to marginalize and degrade the power of its female half.\nNegative progress for the women in country is not a secret. In the last decade, nominations for females at the CMA have tanked. In the first decade of the 21st century, major record labels introduced 43 new female artists; in this past decade, there were 31. Female artists listed at the top of Billboard’s Top Twenty can resemble an endangered species. Spins of female country music stars have plunged. In 2002, the ratio of spins between men and women was 3.4:1. In 2018, it was 10:1. The female artist that got the highest exposure was 11th overall, but women had 3 of the top 10 country music albums. This might not be so significant if country was like other music genres where 12% of people rather than 70% get their music by radio.\nMark Guarino of the Guardian commenting on negative trends for the women in country said, “What makes the situation frustrating is that there is no clear explanation for the imbalance.”\nBut there is. With the women of country demonstrating increasing innovation and marketability, perhaps more than the men of country, the powerful men running country music have been making sure that the power accruing to female country stars is limited and leaves them subordinate.\nWhen women are perceived as becoming too successful in male-dominated industries, backlashes have become too familiar. Country music may be a little different; instead of a normal increase in unconscious biases, discrimination against women is conscious and overt.\n- In 2013, Taylor Swift was accosted during a photoshoot.\n- In 2015, Keith Hill, who oversees 300 country music stations, said in an interview with Country Aircheck, “If you want to make ratings in country radio, take females out.”\n- Pete O’Heeren, the founder of Cold River Records, using email in 2015 advised country star, Katie Armiger: “Taylor Swift hugged and kissed these guys… you choose not to, then that’s up to you and your career will be impacted. Advising you to dress edgy is not out of line either … The audience and the PDs need to find you alluring.”\nIncreasing overt bias is also coming through in the lyrics. The findings of a 2019 study of country music lyrics spelled reinforcement of gender inequality rather than progress toward equality. In the late 20th century, lyrics commonly depicted men and women in the traditional roles of breadwinner husbands with wives tending to chores and children. In the 21st century, lyrics were more inclined toward men providing women with booze and having sex. Instead of portraying women as traditional and subordinate, yet honorable, country music is using a collective voice to convey women as drunken, uninhibited, shameful creatures of sex.\nSexist comments in country are a problem and so is sexual harassment. According to one expert on getting more spins on Indie radio stations, artists need to show radio station managers that they appreciate it when their songs are played. What does appreciate mean? According to a 2018 survey by Rolling Stone Country, female artists meeting with station managers “are expected to be overly accessible and use sexuality as currency.” In fact, so much so that the byline of the article is “Scores of women looking for radio play and professional opportunities say they’ve been subjected to sexual harassment during station visits.” Country music is another industry where powerful men degrade women with sexual objectification that sends a message that their success relies on submission. It’s another industry operating like the microcosm of a patriarchal society.\nUntil recently, country music kept a lid on revelations of sexual harassment. In 2015-2017, Taylor Swift, Meghan Linsey and Katie Armiger broke with protocol and came forward with allegations of sexual harassment. Swift was sued, Armiger was sued, and Linsey was advised to keep the culprit’s name quiet. It’s rare in country for victims or culprits to be named because it’s common knowledge that this is a career-ending move for the victim. Andrea Swift said the reason Taylor didn’t contact the police after DJ David Mueller’s photographed butt grab is they didn’t want the incident defining Taylor. As what? A troublemaker that needs to find a new genre. It’s working. Women like Swift are heading to other music genres, like pop, where women get equal play time. They may endure sexual harassment, but at least they get more play time. In the private sector, aspiring women opt out of one industry and into another when they don’t perceive a fit. That’s doublespeak for realizing that when it comes to increasingly powerful positions, there’s only so much room at the top for women.\nFemale country music stars should see themselves as sisters with other competent aspirational women in male-dominated industries. Look at the leadership hierarchy, the higher up you go, the scarcer women become. In the most powerful positions, women are virtually absent. Medical doctors are one of the highest status professional positions, and female doctors are now nearly as common as male doctors. They too, are facing greater bias and sorely under-represented in leadership. Data is mounting. As women enjoy greater success, they are facing more barriers that will prevent them from leadership positions where they could oversee much-needed changes to halt discrimination that prevents gender equality.\nThe 2019 CMA show is one more illusion of progress for gender equality. Group it with other illusions – including the biggest illusion of all that women are closing in on gender equality. For several years running, the World Economic Forum, the organization that produces an annual gender gap report, has elongated the estimated time for gender equality and the United States is not an exception. As women become more successful and muster the courage to use their voice, forces for the status quo of men on top are doubling down. Subordinates are to be seen – not heard.", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}

Either way, it is always a fun process and leaves me with a new skill that might come in handy down the line.\nOne of my current obsessions that I’m considering getting into ate DTF transfers. Yes, ‘DTF’, but it doesn’t stand for what you’re probably thinking. ‘Direct To Film’ transfers are decals that are transferred onto shirts, cups, or anything else you’d like, via heat. Think of it almost like screen printing but with a decal printed onto a clear film, and then ironed on.\nI came across a variety of people online that sell these transfers so you can add them to your own shirts. It’s cheap to buy the transfer itself, then you can pick up an inexpensive shirt from Walmart, slap them together and you’ve got a cool new shirt for a relatively lower price.\nMany people use this method to make festive shirts for different seasons, holidays, or special occasions. Some even use this method to create shirts they can sell on Etsy or other platforms.\nAlthough I know there are only so many shirts one girl needs, I really want to give this a try.", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}

Cir. 2018)Annotate this Case\nThis case arose when Venezuela and two of its agencies seized all assets of an American drilling company's Venezuelan subsidiary. Both parent and subsidiary filed suit claiming that the expropriation of the subsidiary's business and assets without compensation violated international law.\nOn remand from the Supreme Court, at issue was whether either company had alleged facts that were sufficient, if true, to establish that it had in fact suffered a taking in violation of international law. The DC Circuit held that only the American parent, not its Venezuelan subsidiary, had done so. The court held that the domestic-takings rule barred the subsidiary's expropriation claim where the subsidiary was considered a Venezuelan national under international law. In this case, the subsidiary was incorporated in Venezuela and had a legal identity distinct from that of its parent shareholders under local law. The court further held that, given the subsidiary's Venezuelan nationality, its takings claim against Venezuela was a matter of domestic, not international, law under the domestic-takings rule. Therefore, the court affirmed the district court's dismissal of the subsidiary's claims, as well as the denial of defendants' motion to dismiss the parent's claims.\nThis opinion or order relates to an opinion or order originally issued on May 1, 2015.", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}
{"id": "7528", "text": "Sign an app package file\nCode signing is a common practice for many applications. It's the process of digitally signing a file to verify the author and that the file hasn't been tampered with since it was signed. The signature of the app package file is verified during the publishing of the extension using the\nPublish-NAVApp cmdlet. For more technical information on signing, see Authenticode.\nIf you want to publish an unsigned extension package in your on-premise environment, you need to explicitly state it by using the - SkipVerification parameter on the\nPublish-NAVApp cmdlet. An extension without a valid signature won't be published on AppSource.\nThe signing of an app package file must be performed on a computer that has Dynamics 365 Business Central installed. If you're running Dynamics 365 Business Central on Docker for your development environment, that environment will meet this requirement. You must also have the certificate that will be used for signing on the computer. The certificate must include code signing as the intended purpose. It's recommended that you use a certificate purchased from a third-party certificate authority.\nSteps for signing your .app file\n- Prepare your computer for signing.\n- Make sure that you sign the .app file on a Microsoft Windows computer that has Dynamics 365 Business Central installed.\n- Copy the certificate that you purchased from a third-party certificate authority to a folder on the computer. The example uses a pfx version of the certificate. If the certificate you purchased isn't in a pfx format, create a pfx file. There are resources online, which can help you convert a certificate to\n.pfxformat. The file path for the sample command is\nC:\\Certificates\\MyCert.pfx. (Optionally, create your own certificate for local test or development purposes using the Self-signed certificate information).\n- Install a signing tool such as SignTool or SignCode to the computer. The sample command will use SignTool.\n- Copy your extensions .app file to the computer if it's not already on the computer. The file path for the sample command is\n- Run the command to sign the .app file.\n- The following example signs the Proseware.app file with a time stamp using the certificate in the password-protected MyCert.pfx file. The command is run on the computer that was prepared for the signing. Once the command has been run, the Proseware.app file has been modified with a signature. This file is then used when publishing the extension.\nSignTool sign /f C:\\Certificates\\MyCert.pfx /p MyPassword /t http://timestamp.verisign.com/scripts/timestamp.dll “C:\\NAV\\Proseware.app”\nIt's recommended to use a time stamp when signing the app package file. A time stamp allows the signature to be verifiable even after the certificate used for the signature has expired. For more information, see Time Stamping Authenticode Signatures. Depending on the certification authority, you may need to acquire a specific certificate in order to time stamp, an Extended Validation certificate from DigiCert for example.\nIf you are using the BCContainerHelper PowerShell module to run Dynamics 365 Business Central on Docker, you can use the function\nSign-BCContainerApp to perform all the steps above.\nFor testing purposes and on-premises deployments, it's acceptable to create your own self-signed certificate. You can do so using the New-SelfSignedCertificate cmdlet in PowerShell on Windows 10 or MakeCert.\nThe following example illustrates how to create a new self-signed certificate for code signing:\nNew-SelfSignedCertificate –Type CodeSigningCert –Subject “CN=ProsewareTest”\nThe following (deprecated) MakeCert command is used to create a new self-signed certificate for code signing:\nMakecert –sk myNewKey –n “CN=Prosewaretest” –r –ss my\nCode signing for AppSource\nIf you publish the extension as an app on AppSource, the app package file must be signed using a certificate purchased from a Certification Authority (CA); a self-signed certificate will not be accepted by the technical validation. The CA must have its root certificates in Microsoft Windows. You can obtain a certificate from a range of certificate providers, including but not limited to DigiCert and Symantec, see the image below. You don't have to use an EV Code Signing certificate, standard code signing certificates can be used for signing your extensions.\nYou can check the validity of your code signing by transferring your signed app file to a Windows device which did not sign it. Right-click on the file and go to Properties, Digital Signatures, and then Details. In this pop-up, choose View Certificate and finally go to Certification Path. It should look similar to the below example (though it's a Microsoft binary file):\nIf the Certification Path has only one entry then the file isn't signed correctly and will be rejected by AppSource technical validation.", "scores": {"score": 3, "score_transform_1": 5, "score_transform_2": 5, "score_transform_3": 0}}

It has had a long and interesting journey and it still looks great!\nIn the late Nineteenth and early Twentieth Centuries, department stores were the premier shopping venues in American cities, East to West. The very best department stores became the taste-makers for the carriage trade—and for those who aspired to join it. In the Midwest, one store stood head-and-shoulders over the rest: Marshall Field & Company. Founded in the 1850’s, by the Turn-of-the-Century, Marshall Field’s presided over Chicago with its gigantic, gleaming, celebrity-architect-designed emporium on State Street (that great street). Some might argue it was the best department store in the country.\nIn those days, every department store company was an entity unto itself—not part of a large, national chain with centralized corporate buying offices. Marshall Field’s buyers travelled the globe acquiring wonderful treasures. Designers worked in the company’s Chicago studios drafting exclusive products for the sales floor. And company-employed craftsmen and artisans filled the company’s workshops making those unique products. It was a whole different time in the department store business.\nOne such product is the wonderful lamp, shown above, hand-made in the Teens or Twenties. First, the ceramic vase was made in Japan. Then it was shipped to Chicago where a Marshall Field’s painter-decorator (in this case, Miss Vera L. Smith—who signed her handiwork!) hand-applied the glazing, following a pattern created by the Marshall Field’s designers. Once the lamp was displayed on the sales floor, customers were treated to a unique and beautiful item—an item which could not be found at any other store (anywhere).\nThe lamp above is an interesting blend of the Aesthetic Movement, “Orientalism,” and a touch of the Art Deco movement, soon to come.

{"id": "7583", "text": "After all too familiar world events postponed Thundercat’s 2021 UK Tour, he finally graced the stage at Manchester Academy on April 1st. Real name Stephen Bruner, Thundercat is well known for his unique use of the bass guitar, influencing the hip hop sphere and beyond. His mark can be heard over seminal records by artists such as Kendrick Lamar and Mac Miller.\nAs a solo artist, however, he combines elements of soul, jazz, and funk, and has produced critically acclaimed records such as Drunk and It is What It Is, the latter of which won a Grammy in 2021. The world of Thundercat has much to explore; he incorporates many genres into his work while being enjoyed by a large audience, reflected in the packed-out crowd in Manchester, the penultimate stop before a sold-out Brixton Academy.\nThe crowd filed into the sounds of a DJ set by local MC Konny Kon, which got the audience suitably hyped up for the evening that was to come. Main support came from English-Japanese artist Miso Extra, who donned matching jerseys with her band, and held the decently packed-out crowd with her effortless flows and catchy instrumentals, punchy beats, and manipulated instrumentals – creating a dream-like soundscape. Performing on the release day of her debut EP, Great Taste, Miso Extra looked to be having a great time on stage, engaging the crowd with bilingual lyrics with Lily Allen style delivery. By the time it was time for her slot to end, it felt like barely any time had elapsed, and left the crowd very up for the evening ahead. Miso Extra’s Great Taste EP is on Spotify now.\nApproximately 40 minutes later, a nonchalant Thundercat walks on stage without much fanfare and charmingly asks, ‘You guys doing well? Manchester right?’. Perhaps this opening remark was only charming since he got the city right, and didn’t fall at the first hurdle. Afterwards, he immediately plunges into the opening run of It Is What It Is, playing intro ‘Lost in Space / Great Scott / 22-26’ seamlessly into ‘Interstellar Love’, constructing the tone of the evening before our eyes.\nA wide and rich sound emerges from his six-string bass, and the familiarity of the studio recordings descends into a jam with his keyboardist and drummer while keeping the thread of the song. The paired back stage lighting made everything feel much more improvised, suiting the music. Some in the audience were bemused, but it soon became abundantly clear we were witnessing a masterclass.\nThundercat’s playfulness didn’t stop just musically; he told stories in between songs at considerable length. “All my friends are dead”, he joked after only two songs in the introduction anecdote to the ode to his best friend ‘I Love Louis Cole’; receiving a half laugh-gasp from the audience. However, the crowd ran with him for the most part, save for some talking over him in the more lengthy breaks. These breaks provided light relief but also texture, as the lengthened renditions of album tracks were incredible but very intense. Another highlight included a toy shark being thrown on stage, and the drummer keeping it on one of his drums for the rest of the set; it was equal parts funny and musically impressive.\nIt became clear that Thundercat’s set was just an incredibly well-drilled show, and if you ran with it, the reward was immense. Each band member relied upon nods and winks from the others, much like a jazz gig, and in chaos came an incredible live experience. Dropping hit ‘Dragonball Durag’ early in the set, the whole crowd started dancing, and we became part of the improvisation, voluntarily shouting lines back to him (including “I know I’m covered in cat hair, but I still smell good”, which has to be a first at the Academy).\nAnother first was during ‘A Fan’s Mail (Tron Song Suite II)’ in the middle of the set, Bruner stops the music and demands that the audience show him pictures of their cats. Automatically and without question, people started putting their phone screens in the direction of the stage, Bruner complimenting a selection. My own cat was overlooked, but maybe next time.\nThrough the laughs and the fun came a moment of homage, with Bruner dedicating his song ‘A Message for Austin’, about late friend Austin Peralta to Foo Fighters drummer Taylor Hawkins, regarding his influence on his own upbringing as well as friends and contemporaries Mac Miller and MF DOOM. Thundercat celebrates his cohorts with warmth and recognition. He has built a career on collaboration, meticulously referencing throughout the set of individuals who he looks up to. The audience was left with a sense of community, but also a considerable amount of musical homework to enjoy.\nThe gig ticks along, with the audience feeding off the energy of the extended tracks, when Bruner comes in with the distinctive bass riff of the massive hit ‘Them Changes’. ‘You know it? Sing along!’, he understatedly says with a smile. The energy elevates and it becomes a moment of collective catharsis, further elevated by the incredible bass solo that has become customary but no less mind-blowing. This was the highlight of the gig for me. This transitions into the set closer ‘Funny Thing’, with an increase in tempo and equal feedback from the crowd. The 1 minute 56-second album track becomes a five times longer jazz disco party, forming a call and response with the line “I just wanna party with you”. By the time it comes to a close, the crowd are at a fever pitch, and Bruner and his band leave the stage.\nHearing the demands of ‘one more song’, an encore of 2013’s ‘Tron Song’ is performed. A totally effortless continuation of the previous hour and a half, Bruner looks like he’s barely broken a sweat. A somewhat uncalled for mosh pit is formed, which quickly fizzles out due to it not being that kind of gig at all, and the participants opt for dancing instead. After one final flourish, he bids his farewell, and we filtered out onto Oxford Road knowing that we had seen something incredible and joyful.\nI couldn’t wipe the smile from my face. Thundercat brings a jazz mentality to his live performances, breathing new life into his songs and cementing his place as one of the finest and still underrated artists. Suddenly his resume seems like an understatement; his musical talent is borderline supernatural and produces a unique live show. I think it’s probably the most creative gig I’ve been to, and remarkably still completely accessible and enjoyable. Thundercat created an atmosphere that left you just wanting to party with him.", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}
{"id": "7584", "text": "Unrealistic Promises and Guarantees\nWhen it comes to online gambling, if something seems too good to be true, it probably is. Scam gambling websites often make unrealistic promises and guarantees to lure unsuspecting players. These promises may include guaranteed wins, easy money, or high return rates. Be wary of any website that claims to have a foolproof system for winning or guarantees huge payouts with minimal effort. Legitimate gambling websites understand that gambling involves risks and there are no guarantees of winning.\nLack of Licensing and Regulation\nOne of the most important things to consider when choosing a gambling website is its licensing and regulation. Legitimate gambling websites are required to obtain licenses from reputable authorities to operate legally. These licenses ensure that the website follows strict regulations and fair practices. Scam gambling websites often operate without proper licenses or regulatory oversight. Before joining a gambling website, always verify its licensing and regulation status. If the website does not display its license information or provides vague details, it is likely a scam.\nPoor Online Reputation\nResearching the reputation of a gambling website is crucial to avoid scams. Look for online reviews, forums, and discussions about the website to get an idea of its reputation. Legitimate gambling websites have a positive online presence with satisfied customers. On the other hand, scam gambling websites are often associated with complaints, negative reviews, and unresolved issues. If you come across a gambling website with a poor online reputation, it is best to steer clear to avoid being scammed.\nUnresponsive Customer Support\nCustomer support is an essential aspect of any legitimate gambling website. A reliable website will have a responsive and helpful customer support team that is available to assist players with their queries and concerns. Scam gambling websites often have unresponsive or non-existent customer support. If you encounter difficulties reaching out to customer support or receive generic and unsatisfactory responses, it is a warning sign of a scam. Legitimate gambling websites prioritize customer satisfaction and provide prompt and professional support.\nUnsecured Payment Methods\nThe security of your financial transactions is of utmost importance when gambling online. Legitimate gambling websites employ secure payment methods to safeguard their players’ financial information. Scam gambling websites, on the other hand, often use unsecured payment methods that put players at risk of identity theft and fraud. Watch out for websites that ask for sensitive financial details without providing adequate security measures. Always ensure that the website uses SSL encryption and trusted payment gateways before making any transactions.\nLack of Transparency in Terms and Conditions\nBefore signing up for any gambling website, it is essential to thoroughly read and understand its terms and conditions. Legitimate gambling websites have transparent terms and conditions that clearly outline the rules, regulations, and policies. Scam gambling websites may have convoluted or unclear terms and conditions, making it difficult for players to understand their rights and obligations. If you come across a website that lacks transparency in its terms and conditions, it is a red flag indicating a potential scam.

There’s no prep work; feel free to drop in any time (and if you’re not on the meal plan we’ll provide a swipe). The way it works is we print out a math competition from somewhere in the world, and then brainstorm and attack the problems together.\n- We’ll also meet for lunch on Wednesdays (in Mission at noon, room TBD) to do Project Euler problems.\n- There are several math competitions each year. Some time in October or November we’ll defend the Green Chicken when Middlebury travels here. There’s also the Virginia Tech math competition (we’ll do this remotely Saturday October 25th), and the Putnam exam (which will probably be Sat Dec 6th).\n- We also frequently field teams for the Mathematical Contest in Modeling.\n- I’m also teaching a class on math puzzles and problem solving, Math 331: The little Questions. Feel free to check out the homepage for resources, as well as lectures (each class is recorded and uploaded to YouTube).\nMany people love math puzzles or riddles. They’re often fun, frequently illustrate a beautiful concept or perspective, and unlike real world research problems they typically have an elegant answer. Below is one of my favorites. It can be solved by brute force but only at great cost (and a high probability of forgetting a case); however, if you look at it the right way it’s just one line (and this proper perspective illustrates a powerful technique which is of use in research mathematics).\nProblem: Imagine you have 10 distinct cookies but 5 distinguishable, hungry graduate students (so they’re not engineering students working away in a lab!). How many ways can you divide all the cookies among the people? In other words, we only care about how many cookies each person gets, not which ones.\nI run a math riddles page (see http://mathriddles.williams.edu/ ), and this was the first problem I added; the problems and resources posted there for students and teachers are used in schools throughout the world, and if you’re interested in helping with the site drop me a line at [email protected].

Operating on a Larger Compressor than Needed Can Result in Extra Costs.\nAre you using a larger compressor than you need? An air audit can tell you if you can save on maintenance costs by switching to a smaller compressor. Parts might not be as expensive for a 75 HP when compared to a 100 HP, and a smaller compressor may require less compressor oil.\n3. An Air Audit can Identify Equipment Issues.\nFaulty thermostats, coolers, and inlet valves can all be identified during an air audit.z\n4. Audits can show a Lack of Storage (Air Receivers) in a System.\nAir receivers are important for a number of reasons, but they are especially important for storage in high demand areas. Storage in high demand areas reduces KW by the compressor if applied properly.\n5. Audits can Identify Areas of Wasted Air.\nAn air on a demand side audit includes leak detection and shows leaks. A typical plant has 20% to 30% of its compressed air just feeding leaks. So a 100 HP compressor may be using approximately 25 HP just to feed leaks. That can be thousands of $$$ every year.\n6.

{"id": "7622", "text": "Summary: This Urban Design open competition aims to obtain a plan for the Cultural center in the historical city of Marrakech. The Center should be an example of a green cultural and exhibition city – where usage of energy, alternative energy and recycling and sustainable development is implemented as an example for the rest of the world.\nDescription: An oasis is a lush green area in the middle of a desert, centered around a natural spring or a well. It is almost a reverse island, in a sense, because it is a tiny area of water surrounded by a sea of sand or rock.\nOases can be fairly easy to spot—at least in deserts that do not have towering sand dunes. The sight of an oasis on the horizon has been a very welcome one for desert travelers. They vary in size from a cluster of date palms around a well or a spring to a city and its irrigated cropland. Dates, cotton, olives, figs, citrus fruits, wheat and corn (maize) are common oasis crops.\nRivers that flow through some deserts provide permanent sources of water for large, elongated oases. The fertile Nile River valley and delta in Egypt, supplied with water from the Nile River, is an example of this type of large oasis. At 22,000 square kilometers, it might be the largest oasis in the world.\nThe culture in Marrakech, just like any culture worldwide, plays an important part in shaping a city and its people. Marrakech is rich in culture and so diverse with its historical influences reflected through the beautiful architecture, delicious cuisine and welcoming people. The culture in the ‘red city’ is unique and has been strongly influenced by Arab and Islamic civilisations because of the vast Berber population. The culture in Marrakech is portrayed through language, religion, music, crafts, and tradition.\nBathed in the pink glow of its adobe walls, the lovely Marrakesh throws open its doors to all culture lovers. Marrakesh is composed of an array of influences that defy eras, a mosaic of colours where the wonders of the past and the present come into focus.\nHow can a concept of Oasis and the culture of Marrakech come together in an architectural project that is much more than a culture box? How can it symbolize the Marrakech of the future?\nThe culture in Marrakech is strongly influenced by Arab, Berber, and Islamic civilizations. The city was founded c.1070, nearly a thousand years ago, by the Almoravid dynasty (an imperial Berber Muslim dynasty).\nThis unique project will give the city the possibility to be flowering again and offer unique opportunities for investors in the BOT (Build, Operate and Transfer) projects for shopping mall and offices.\nThe oasis should take care of environmental issues and reduce waste. The design, construction and operation should have sustainable development in mind. The oasis could be the first cultural centre in the world created on a sustainable basis – and without to compromise creativity, practicality, costs and uniqueness. This will also make it attractive for organizers and visitors to come.\nDownload the competition brief here.", "scores": {"score": 3, "score_transform_1": 5, "score_transform_2": 5, "score_transform_3": 0}}

{"id": "7649", "text": "After filing to go public, most companies either go through with an offering within a few months or formally withdraw it.\nBut some do neither. Rather, having mistimed the market or misjudged their own IPO readiness, some companies continue to lie in wait, prepared to restart the process when conditions improve.\nThis past week, we saw one such example from Turo, the peer-to-peer car rental platform. The San Francisco-based company — which originally filed to go public in January 2022 — submitted an updated registration that included earnings up to the first half of this year.\nTo date, 14-year-old Turo has submitted six updated filings, posting regular growth in revenue. For the first half of 2023, revenue totaled $408 million — up from $333 million in the same period a year ago — while net loss widened to $23 million.\nCould this latest filing signify that Turo is ready to finally take the IPO plunge? Certainly the window has been opening some, led by Arm’s massive offering this week, as well as planned IPOs from Instacart and Klaviyo.\nIf so, Turo likely won’t be alone. Should the window stay open, we can expect to see many more unicorns resuscitate IPO plans first initiated toward the tail end of the market boom a couple of years ago.\nThree of the top candidates are companies that filed confidentially for a public offering but have not yet done so publicly.\nNavan: The corporate travel and expense management software provider formerly known as TripActions reportedly submitted a confidential filing for a public offering roughly a year ago. Buzz around a potential IPO has been mounting for some time for the 8-year-old Palo Alto-based company, which has raised about $1 billion in equity funding and $1.2 billion in debt financing to date. While Navan has yet to submit a public filing, there’s good reason to think this could be imminent as the IPO market heats up.\nReddit: The online discussion forum announced in December 2021 that it had confidentially submitted a draft registration statement to the Securities and Exchange Commission for a planned IPO. Since then, market conditions changed for the worse, while Reddit itself faced criticism following a policy change that prompted platform moderators to strike and shutter forums. We still haven’t seen a public filing, but that could be coming as the IPO window opens.\nCohesity: Data management software provider Cohesity reportedly submitted a confidential filing for an initial public offering in December 2021. Now, it looks like the San Jose-based unicorn may be resuscitating those plans. In August, Cohesity announced several new hires, including a new CFO, Eric Brown, who has prior experience heading finance for public companies including Electronic Arts, McAfee and Polycom.\nIn addition, there are companies that filed to go public in late 2021 or early 2022 but later withdrew their offerings. These include energy-as-a-service provider Redaptive, business software company Justworks, and workflow automation provider Basis Technologies. While none have formally refiled, it is noteworthy that they were ready to go a couple years ago, before conditions turned. We’ll see if any attempt a restart.\nFor those considering another shot at an IPO, Thursday’s well-received offering from chip designer Arm Holdings offers an encouraging sign. While valuations of growth technology companies have fallen sharply in the past couple years, there’s still plentiful investor appetite for industry leaders with solid financials.\n- Arm Shares Pop In Nasdaq Debut, Reopening IPO Market\n- Klaviyo And Instacart File Going-Public Plans, Kickstarting IPO Market\nIllustration: Dom Guzman\nSearch less.

It definitely looks premium.\nBLU stuffs the box full of accessories. There’s a wall charger, micros USB cable, USB OTG cable, headphones, screen protector, and a case. That’s unusual as it seems more and more manufacturers are eliminating pack in accessories. It’s clear that BLU wants to provide a complete experience right out of the box.

{"id": "7751", "text": "Leaky Gut Syndrome: What Is It and How to Heal Your Gut Lining\nOur bodies are like complex machines, and one critical part of this machine is our digestive system. It’s responsible for breaking down the food we eat and absorbing nutrients to keep us healthy. But sometimes, our digestive system can develop problems, and one of these problems is called “Leaky Gut Syndrome.” In this article, we will explore what Leaky Gut Syndrome is and learn about ways to heal your gut lining.\nWhat Is Leaky Gut Syndrome?\nImagine your digestive system as a long, twisty tube. This tube, known as the gastrointestinal tract, has an important job. It helps your body absorb the good stuff from the food you eat, like vitamins and minerals, while keeping out harmful things like bacteria and toxins. This job is possible because of a tight barrier that lines your gut.\nLeaky Gut Syndrome happens when this barrier becomes weak or damaged. Think of it as tiny holes or gaps forming in the lining of your gut. When this happens, things that should stay inside your gut can leak out into your bloodstream. These can include undigested food particles, bacteria, and other substances.\nWhat Causes Leaky Gut Syndrome?\nSeveral factors can contribute to Leaky Gut Syndrome:\n- Diet: A poor diet high in processed foods, sugar, and unhealthy fats can harm the gut lining.\n- Stress: Chronic stress can weaken the gut barrier over time.\n- Medications: Some medications, like non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), can harm the gut lining.\n- Infections: Certain infections can damage the gut lining.\n- Imbalance in Gut Bacteria: An imbalance in the gut microbiome can lead to Leaky Gut Syndrome.\nSymptoms of Leaky Gut Syndrome\nLeaky Gut Syndrome is a bit tricky because its symptoms can vary from person to person. Some common signs may include:\n- Digestive Issues: Many people with suspected Leaky Gut Syndrome report digestive problems such as bloating, gas, diarrhea, constipation, and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)-like symptoms.\n- Food Sensitivities: Individuals may develop new sensitivities or allergies to certain foods, leading to reactions like skin rashes, headaches, or digestive discomfort after eating specific items.\n- Fatigue: Chronic fatigue or feelings of low energy are sometimes attributed to Leaky Gut Syndrome.\n- Joint Pain: Some people report joint pain and inflammation, which they believe is linked to a “leaky” gut.\n- Skin Problems: Conditions like acne, eczema, or other skin issues are sometimes connected to Leaky Gut Syndrome in anecdotal reports.\n- Autoimmune Diseases: There is some speculation that increased intestinal permeability may contribute to the development or exacerbation of autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, or celiac disease.\n- Mood and Mental Health Issues: There is ongoing research into the potential links between gut health and mental health. Some individuals with Leaky Gut Syndrome may report symptoms like mood swings, anxiety, or depression.\n- Headaches: Chronic headaches or migraines are occasionally associated with Leaky Gut Syndrome.\n- Weight Fluctuations: Some individuals may experience unexplained weight gain or difficulty losing weight, which they attribute to gut health issues.\nIt’s important to emphasize that these symptoms are nonspecific, meaning they can be linked to various other health conditions or lifestyle factors. If you suspect you have Leaky Gut Syndrome or are experiencing these symptoms, it’s essential to consult a healthcare professional for a proper evaluation and diagnosis.\nHealing Your Gut Lining\nThe good news is that you can take steps to heal your gut lining if you suspect you have Leaky Gut Syndrome. Here are some easy-to-follow tips:\n1. Eat a Gut-Friendly Diet:\nTo heal your gut, focus on eating whole, unprocessed foods. Include plenty of fiber-rich fruits and vegetables, which support a healthy gut microbiome. Avoid or limit foods high in sugar, processed foods, and excessive alcohol.\n2. Manage Stress:\nChronic stress can harm your gut lining. Practice stress-reducing techniques like meditation, yoga, or deep breathing exercises.\n3. Consider Probiotics:\nProbiotics are good bacteria that can help balance your gut microbiome. You can find them in foods like yogurt or take them as supplements.\n4. Stay Hydrated:\nDrinking enough water is crucial for digestive health. It helps keep the mucous lining of your gut healthy.\n5. Get Enough Sleep:\nQuality sleep is essential for overall health, including gut health. Aim for 7-8 hours of restful sleep each night.\n6. Avoid Overuse of Medications:\nIf possible, reduce your use of medications that can harm your gut lining, especially NSAIDs. Consult with your healthcare provider for alternative options.\n7. Consider a Low-FODMAP Diet:\nSome people with IBS find relief by following a low-FODMAP diet, which restricts certain types of carbohydrates that can irritate the gut.\n8. Consult a Healthcare Professional:\nIf you suspect you have Leaky Gut Syndrome or are experiencing severe symptoms, it’s essential to consult a healthcare professional. They can provide personalized advice and recommend appropriate tests or treatments.\nLeaky Gut Syndrome may sound complicated, but it’s all about maintaining the health of your gut lining. By making some simple lifestyle changes, like eating a healthier diet, managing stress, and getting enough sleep, you can help heal your gut and improve your overall well-being. Remember, it’s always a good idea to consult with a healthcare professional for guidance tailored to your specific needs.\n- Harvard. (n.d.). Leaky Gut: What Is It, And What Does It Mean For You?

With the Dark Trine at large and ready to attack, the people of Kinderra are in trouble, and Mirana cannot go back. She has to finish her quest for Jasal’s Keep. One way to save her people is by giving up the key to Keep’s power to the Dark Trine, but that would mean her people will be ruled by a madman. Or, she could unleash the Keep’s power, end the Dark Trine, and lose Teague forever. This is a sacrifice she will have to make if she desires to protect Kinderra. Mirana gathers the courage to face her destiny, but she wonders if there is another way. Was there a way for Mirana to have it all?\nI have been following this story from the start, and Mirana’s growth still surprised me. She is one of the best characters in contemporary literature. Mirana is well-rounded with always some room for progress; human and believable. Her emotions are so natural and relatable that you can feel them. Author C.K. Donnelly’s world-building is outstanding, and the dialogues are revealing. I love Teague and his side plot. I love how C.K. Donnelly gives him just as much importance as she does to Mirana. The action is intense and immediate in this installment. With how Tetric is portrayed and how he acts, the action that follows his decisions is enough to give readers an adrenaline rush. This is a young adult fantasy novel, but people of all ages and tastes will love this series! It exceeded all of my expectations and I cannot wait to see what happens next!", "scores": {"score": 0, "score_transform_1": 0, "score_transform_2": 0, "score_transform_3": 1}}

{"id": "7794", "text": "In the first half of 2012, we have had 103 recalls have either taken place, been scheduled or have had the official resign in the face of a recall. Once again, they've taken place in 17 different states.\nToday alone, there will be 17 recalls. There will be the six in Wisconsin; three in Fullerton, California, which would be a major national story if it wasn't for the Wisconsin recalls; three in Greenfield, California and five in Hermiston, Oregon.\nOf the 103 recalls, they breakdown like this:\n- 32 recalls resulted in a vote for removal. They took place in 17 different states\n- 14 recalls resulted in a resignation in the face of removal\n- 1 recall failed to get on the ballot, but the official resigned anyway\n- 1 recall saw the official die in office\n- 27 recalls resulted in the targeted official won the recall election\n- 30 are scheduled to take place between today and August\n- 6 instances, most notable El Paso, Texas, a judge rejected the recall.\n- 6 other instances, the targeted officials are either still fighting the recall in court or refusing to schedule one as a member of the city council.\n- 52 attempted recalls (at least) that failed to gather enough signatures to get on the ballot.\n- 115 (at least) open and unresolved recall petitions circulating now (I may be off on this -- in some of these, the recall might have been abandoned).\nThe recalls are against all types of officials, Six mayors have been removed, five have survived, and another four are facing a recall vote.\nThe reasons for the recall span the spectrum. Some of the more noteworthy ones including opposing another member's appointment of his girlfriend to the village council, trashing a hotel room, and one launched by the wife of a losing candidate. In one ongoing recall attempt, we have the official facing charges of rape, pimping, pandering and maybe attempted murder (don't worry, that was just a school board member). Last year, we had a school board member facing a recall who was caught sexting with a 14 year old. That was not the reason for the recall (it came out during the campaign).\nAmong other nuggets are that the mayors of both Troy, Montana and Troy, Michigan are facing recalls (the mayor from Montana lost). And, while it may be time to stop all of your weeping and swallow your pride, the mayor of Tombstone, Arizona was recalled. And yes, he was replaced by the owner of Johnny Ringo's bar, who will now be your huckleberry.\nIn summary, we should be ahead of last year's pace. The big caveat, outside of the fact that I may be missing a number of recalls both this year and last, is that this is a presidential election year, not an off year election. I think it is possible that there may be less recalls on Election Day than last year (there were 30 on the first two Tuesday's in November). Perhaps people will be more focused on the presidential race, and will ignore recalling local officials. Of course, the opposite could occur. We will see in November.", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

{"id": "7828", "text": "Insurance Home and Car\nInsurance Home and Car: Factors to Consider\nA house and car are two of the most significant purchases you will make in your lifetime. With any investment, you want to protect it, and purchasing insurance home and car is the best way. Below are factors to consider when searching for insurance home and car.\nNormal wear and tear, natural disasters, theft, vandalism, and other incidents happen, but paying for these unexpected problems could be overwhelming, especially if your family does not have home insurance. If your things are lost, stolen, or damaged due to a covered hazard, your policy provider will be responsible for paying for the repairs and replacements. Although some personal belongings are irreplaceable, it is best to have the insurance coverage for those items that can be fixed or replaced. Since you do not know the exact costs of replacements and repairs, you should choose a home insurance policy that pays out on a cost basis, as opposed to cash value terms.\nProtection from Accidents and Injuries\nCar insurance is not only mandatory, it is necessary. Millions of automobile accidents take place each year, and not having insurance could put your expensive investment at risk. If you are the victim in an accident and the person does not have insurance, you could wait months or years to get a settlement from the court. However, having a car insurance policy could cover most repairs and injuries you and your passengers incur due to an accident. In some cases, a car insurance policy can supplement insufficient health coverage. Since most states require personal injury insurance, a plan could cover hospital and doctor treatment, dental work, home care, and rehabilitation services that people sustain as a driver or passenger.\nMany independent agencies offer insurance home and car, in bundles. Packaging the policies does not take away from the benefits that you receive; in most cases, it just makes the costs lower. When you choose this option, you do not have to deal with multiple agencies for your services, which cuts down on time as well. Since homes are more expensive than most vehicles, the discount for the house insurance is typically more substantial than the deal for the automobile portion. To prevent you from going to another company when your policy is up for renewal, most businesses avoid significant rate increases.\nWhen you are ready to find insurance home and car, you should research reputable, independent agencies to compare benefits and pricing. Speak with agency representatives to determine what discounts you qualify for, and to learn more about the policies, as far as what is covered and what you will need to pay for out-of-pocket. Your goal is to find quality insurance that protects your home and car, as well as your family!

{"id": "7830", "text": "For Millwall and Charlie Hurley, the 1957–58 season in Division Three South started at home to Southampton. The South London Press reported that “Hurley was on the form that earned him his Eire cap – and that is certainly going to earn him a lot more. He completely dominated the centre of the field and the reports the talent scouts sent out must have set many a manager itching to get his hands on the cheque book.”\nThe 2-1 defeat failed to knock Millwall, who followed up by recording four straight victories, the last 2-1 against Port Vale after which the South London Press match report stated: “Hurley so dominated the middle that Millwall were able to keep up a non-stop attack in a thrilling game.”\nIn the sixth game, against Exeter City, Hurley and Stan Anslow (who died in April 2017) collided, resulting in a broken leg for the right back. Ten-man Millwall lost 2-0 and Anslow did not play again that season. Two weeks later Charlie Hurley left The Den.\nDescribed by Hurley as the hardest full back he ever played alongside, Anslow has the following to say about the ex-Millwall centre half and football in general in the 1950s.\nCharlie Hurley’s strengths were his ability to read the game and control the defence. His biggest weakness was his self-belief; at times he needed to be reassured that he was doing everything that was asked of him. He did play exceptionally well in some games. When the Millwall crowd take to you then you are on a winner. They certainly took to Charlie.\nIn those days players had to be tough because of the conditions we played in. Playing in the mud with leather boots and a leather ball was not a doddle. Some of us lads at Millwall socialised after training, which gave us a close feeling as a team. It was the best time of my life and I wouldn’t have changed a thing.\nThe final game of Hurley’s Millwall career took place in the derby at Loftus Road, won by Queens Park Rangers with three second-half goals against a flu-hit Lions. It was reported by the South London Press that “Charlie Hurley often came to the rescue and several times wandered up field to get his now disjointed attack going.”\nUntil 1925 and a change in the offside law, centre halves had been attacking players. But then Herbert Chapman converted Herbie Roberts into a defensive player and the “stopper” centre half was born. That was the way it stayed until Stan Cullis, the Wolves and England centre half (who became manager of the Molineux side in 1949) leading to the Black Country club’s finest period, decided the pivot of his team should be the man who started his own team’s attacks as well as stopping the other team’s. Cullis was convinced that an attractive team needed a good footballer at centre half. But it was rare for a centre half to wander over the halfway line.\nSunderland’s season had started disastrously and when they lost 5-0 in the third match at Wolves, Argus reported that “the score would have been even greater but for wild shooting by the home team in the first half.” A slight recovery was capped by the winning of the first Tyne–Wear derby of the season, a 2-0 Roker Park victory watched by only 45,718 on September 21st with Don Revie and left winger Colin Grainger scoring the goals. Grainger had been signed for £17,000 the previous season from Sheffield United, where he had won seven England caps. He went on to make 120 league appearances for Sunderland, scoring 14 times.\nDespite the Newcastle victory, new manager Alan Brown, concerned about the heavy defeat at Molineux, was looking to bolster his defence. He had earmarked the Millwall youngster as the player he wanted at centre half. The Sunderland manager and his vice-chairman, Syd Collings, on holiday in London, attended the match at Loftus Road where they were given permission to speak to Hurley the following morning.\nHurley, with more than one hundred League appearances, not to mention his international debut, was not that impressed and was quoted in the Sunderland Evening Echo on September 25th;\nI do not intend to leave my home in London. I am playing for a first team and I am on first team money. I am quite satisfied and I have already told the club that if I must be transferred then it’s got to be to another London club. Why should I move? I am happy at Millwall.\nHurley’s references to first team money are interesting in today’s context. Players at all clubs were restricted from earning more than the agreed “maximum wage”, which in 1957 was £17 per week during the season and £14 in the close season. It was Sunderland’s breaking of these restrictions by making illegal payments that had put them in trouble during the summer of 1957. By moving, Hurley would not see his wages increased. Living at home with his parents and three brothers and three sisters was comfortable enough.\nThe Echo reported that “several clubs are known to be interested in Hurley” and that “no move has yet been made by Chelsea, but popular belief in London is that the player will end up at Stamford Bridge”. Chelsea had won their first league championship only two years previously.\nBob Pennington, writing in the Sunday Express, urged the Pensioners to not delay, with the banner headline “DRAKE MUST BUY £20,000 HURLEY” accompanying a half-page article in which he stated “This supremely talented young Chelsea team needs only a player of Hurley’s undisputed class to mature into Britain’s greatest Soccer machine within five years.”\nHurley was in such demand that he was asked to play for the South against the North in an exhibition six-a-side match at the White City, where, ironically, he lined up against Don Revie and Len Shackleton of Sunderland.\nMeanwhile Millwall chairman Micky Purser said: “We have had a chat with the boy and now the matter rests with him. We don’t want to stand in his way if he wished to go into a better class of soccer.” Millwall, however, needed the money and were lining up Ray Brand as Hurley’s replacement.\nHurley refused to yield to Brown’s persuasion and when the manager took the train to Leeds United for a midweek match that Sunderland lost 2-1 there appeared no prospect of Hurley changing his mind. Nevertheless Brown travelled back to London after the game to resume his appeal to the Millwall centre half.\nOn Friday September 27th 1957 the Sunderland Echo reported, alongside a Ritz Cinema advert for The Prince and the Showgirl featuring Laurence Olivier and Marilyn Monroe, that after Brown put his case to the family and “Mrs Hurley finally gave her parental approval (Hurley) had promptly made up his mind and signed on the spot.”\nIn a series of radio interviews for the BBC years later Hurley admitted in 1957;\nI had no idea where Sunderland was and that my first reaction was ‘no way’ to going there. I really didn’t want to go but Alan Brown was a charmer. He hardly spoke to me. He spoke to my mother, lovely family, lovely house, my what lovely kids... in all fairness they weren’t that lovely, we’d had a tough old upbringing and a tough old life. My dad was a tough old cookie. The Bomber [Hurley’s nickname for Brown] was using his charm and he melted my mother. My dad just wanted me to become a famous footballer, so there were no problems with Dad and in the end I said OK.\nOne factor which had weighed against Hurley signing for Sunderland was revealed by Bob Pennington, who wrote afterwards that “the reason for Hurley’s indecision about leaving home was “a close knitted family where affection goes much deeper than family” with Hurley stating;\nI’m one of the breadwinners here. It’s not easy you know. Dad was ill for three months. I was here at home to help out. Mum needs all the help she can get. She’s been wonderful to all of us.\nWhen Hurley signed the contract he got £10 as a signing-on fee. He gave this to his dad to go out and celebrate with his mates;\nHe came back with £6 change – you’ve got to remember that he took an awful lot of people out. It was 10d [4p] a pint then, 10d a pint! Good beer as well.\nBy moving to Sunderland, Hurley joined a long list of Irish people who had migrated to the north-east. As long ago as 1851 the census showed there were 18,501 Irish by birth resident in County Durham.\nIt was reported that Hurley was signed by Sunderland for a fee of £18,000 plus an agreement for the club to play Millwall in a friendly game at The Den, the gate receipts of which were expected to add another £3,000 to the struggling club’s coffers.\nComparisons with today’s transfer fees are difficult but at the time the record fee for a player was £35,000, so the equivalent fee today might be around £15 million, and that for a centre half not yet twenty- one!\nThe Millwall fans knew just how good he was, because in 2007, in the run-up to the Dockers’ Day events at the New Den, a poll was organised by the Supporters Association and the Millwall fanzine The Lion Roars to pick the best player to ever play for Millwall – the largest number of votes went to Charlie Hurley.\nFollowing the transfer, Hurley was given time off to prepare for Ireland’s World Cup qualifier against Denmark in Copenhagen the next Wednesday and so he missed Sunderland’s 3-0 defeat of Luton Town on the Saturday, a result that moved the Roker Park club up to seventeenth.\nHurley could not know it but the journey north was to be the start of the most amazing period of his life.\nIf Hurley had the time to take a trip round Sunderland before signing he could not have failed to pick up that this was a place where hard work, skill, honesty and loyalty were important and valued qualities among a largely working class community.\nEmotions among the Roker crowd could run high, and many a Sunderland player, both before and after Hurley’s time, could expect to incur the crowd’s wrath if they failed to produce the goods. Clearly a fine start was essential.\nWhich is precisely what did not happen on October 5th 1957 at Bloomfield Road, Blackpool, when Charlie Hurley replaced George Aitken at centre half for his debut game. Not all Sunderland supporters were happy about his inclusion and during the 1957–58 season a number wrote to the Sunderland Sports Echo to confirm this. Before the game, Argus had written that he fancied Sunderland to get a point. Buoyed by the signing of Hurley and the league debut of seventeen-year-old Alan Spence from Houghton-le-Spring in County Durham, not to mention the chance of a decent night out on the beer, a large number of fans travelled to the match. Argus reported that “there was a strong contingent of North- East supporters in the crowd”, which was well above average.\nBloomfield Road, which in the twenty-first century has a limit of less than 10,000, had a near capacity crowd of 33,172 on the day. They saw the Seasiders equal their best ever league victory as, inspired by Stanley Matthews, they tore apart Sunderland, scoring in the first minute. Blackpool’s team also included England full back, and now BBC radio summariser Jimmy Armfield and ex-Manchester United forward Ernie Taylor, later to join Sunderland.\nAt half-time it was 4-0, with Hurley’s centre forward opponent Ray Charnley scoring twice. And, despite left winger Bill Perry being injured and virtually a spectator and Charnley off the pitch from the sixtieth minute, the home side scored another two to make it 6-0.\nThen, with a minute to go, “Hurley in attempting to clear turned the ball against the underside of the bar and over the line” reported Argus, who commented that Hurley’s introduction to the defence had “far from bringing about an improvement” thrown it into confusion.\nAlthough it was a few weeks before most people, even in the USSR, knew about it, the day before Hurley’s debut at Blackpool on October 4th 1957 the Soviet Union had successfully launched Sputnik I, the world’s first artificial satellite. This hurtled into space and orbited the earth in little more than ninety minutes. Hurley, who celebrated his 21st birthday that day, would probably have found himself less confused had he been in space rather than in the middle of Sunderland’s defence.\nThings could only get better. They did, but only marginally when the following week Sunderland went back to Lancashire and lost 6-0 at Burnley. In goal manager Alan Brown, returning to his previous club for the first time, was forced by injuries to play Ronnie Routledge in only his second game. Unlike Hurley, who was to go on and make hundreds more appearances for the Wearsiders, Routledge never played again, moving on to Bradford Park Avenue.\n“At Burnley, Charlie put his foot on the ball and tried to go round somebody, lost it and it was in the back of the net; people thought ‘Oh no, what have we bought here?’” recalls Stan Anderson.\nAnd Hurley remembers his first game;\nGoodness gracious, seven-nil. Someone said years later had I scored two own goals. I said I didn’t score any but I did make four! Because I was a footballing centre half I could only play one way. Alan Brown signed me because he was once a centre half. But he was a cruncher, so he must always deep down have wanted to be a footballing centre half because otherwise you would never sign a guy like me. So anyway it got a lot better as it was Burnley away and we lost six- nil!\nCharlie Summerville, from the Daily Mail, came up to me and said, ‘Charles, what are you going to do, you’ve been signed to improve the defence and it was seven-nil and six-nil’ and I said to him, ‘How many players improve so quickly? In about six games’ time we could get to a clean sheet’. Charlie loved me after that... seven and six made thirteen. It could have been very unlucky for me.\nI was also lucky enough to go to Sunderland in 1957. I didn’t like it when I first went there, plus the first time I went into a club you know and there was bingo on and the caller pulled out seventy-six and said ‘seven and six’ was Charlie worth it! I missed my family and loads of mates. I didn’t know at the start what would happen, I just thought I’d be another footballer for Sunderland football club who’d play a few years and then move on. I didn’t know I would still be remembered more than fifty years later for example. I didn’t know that I was going to be as good as I was.\nWeather permitting, Mark Metcalf and his son Charlie, who features in the current edition of A Love Supreme, are set tomorrow to accept on the pitch at the New Den the joint Millwall/Sunderland Bradley Lowery Banner that was designed by Millwall fans and was present at the Stadium of Light in November when Lions fans made a donation of £2,800 to the Bradley Lowery Foundation.\nSadly, a long standing family commitment means Sunderland and Millwall legend Charlie Hurley can’t make the game tomorrow. But he will very much be there in spirit and has asked me to “pass on his regards to both sets of supporters, both of whom were - and still are - always marvellous to me.”\nThis article is taken from Charlie’s authorised biography - “The Greatest Centre Half the World has Ever Seen” of 2008 and which I wrote. It tells the story of Charlie’s transfer from Millwall to Sunderland in 1957 and how things didn’t immediately go to plan when he arrived in the North east.

This unique venture was his first experience with this kind of project, and it added a new layer of meaning and complexity to his artistic journey. The creative process involved considering the bottle's shape, brand essence, and the challenge of fitting the design on a relatively small canvas. Despite these constraints, his design effectively conveys our brand character while maintaining a sense of awe through artistic expression.\nGuy Stork - ThatGuy Tattoos, Gold Coast - Guy Stork, a dedicated tattoo artist from the vibrant Gold Coast, has been in the tattoo industry since 2009, bringing 14 years of experience to his craft.

Guy's collaboration with us on this project was his first experience of this kind, which excited him, given his long-standing appreciation for our products. The creative process of designing a tattoo for a vodka bottle was relatively smooth, with size being the primary consideration.

The two official subspecialties of orthopaedic surgery are orthopaedic sports medicine and surgery of the hand.\nWeekend Athletes & Injuries\nSan Diego is the perfect environment to pursue outdoor activities since the weather allows us to be active outside year-round. We even have an Olympic Training Center here because our climate is so ideal.\nThere are times when, no matter how careful we are, accidents happen. Sometimes the accidents are minor and can be treated with some ice and a bandage, but there are other times when no one but a trained orthopaedist can treat the problem.\nTreating Aging Bones\nAs we age, our bones become more brittle, and our ability to recover from injuries is slower. We haven’t figured out how to reverse aging, but an orthopaedic surgeon can help determine what kind of treatment would be best for older patients, up to and including replacement of certain joints, like hips.\nSome common reasons to seek an orthopaedic surgeon include: to repair a broken bone, to treat carpal tunnel syndrome, for joint replacement surgery, or to correct a sports injury. They are also involved with the care of patients whose musculoskeletal problems include congenital deformities, trauma, infections, tumors, degenerative diseases, and metabolic disturbances of the musculoskeletal system.\nFor most orthopaedic injuries and conditions, there are many treatment options to consider. Before recommending surgery, an orthopaedic surgeon may treat musculoskeletal conditions by using medication, exercise, or other rehabilitative therapies. If a patient does not respond to other treatments, surgery may be necessary. There are numerous types of orthopaedic surgeries, but some of the most common include: fusion, internal fixation, joint replacement, osteotomy, and soft tissue repair. An orthopaedic surgeon may work in a multidisciplinary team of specialists including rehabilitation specialists, neurologists, rheumatologists, primary care physicians, and other specialists in order to provide the best management and/or treatment plan depending on your injury or condition.", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}

{"id": "7903", "text": "Table of Contents\nWhat differentiates plasma from other states of matter?\nLike gases, plasmas have no fixed shape or volume, and are less dense than solids or liquids. But unlike ordinary gases, plasmas are made up of atoms in which some or all of the electrons have been stripped away and positively charged nuclei, called ions, roam freely. It is the liquid portion of blood.\nHow do you distinguish between different types of matter?\n- Matter can exist in one of three main states: solid, liquid, or gas.\n- Solid matter is composed of tightly packed particles.\n- Liquid matter is made of more loosely packed particles.\n- Gaseous matter is composed of particles packed so loosely that it has neither a defined shape nor a defined volume.\nWhy is plasma excluded from the states of matter?\nPlasma is said to be a distinct phase because it does not observe the usual description and physical laws that are used to describe the usual 3 states of matter, on several counts: Plasma is not in equilibrium. Often it is far from an equilibrium. Therefore, thermodynamics can’t be used to explain.\nWhat properties distinguish solids from liquids?\nsolid: Has a definite shape and volume. liquid: Has a definite volume, but take the shape of the container. gas: Has no definite shape or volume. change of state: When matter is converted from one of the three states (example: solid, liquid, or gas) to another state.\nWhat is plasma matter examples?\nExamples of plasma include lightning, the aurora, a welding arc, and (of course) a plasma ball toy. Plasma is the most abundant state of matter in the universe. Unlike solids, liquids, and gases, plasma consists of free electrons or ions that aren’t bound to an atomic nucleus.\nWhat are the 26 states of matter?\nIs electricity a plasma?\nPlasma is one of the four common states of matter. A plasma is an electrically charged gas. Because the particles (electrons and ions) in a plasma have an electrical charge, the motions and behaviors of plasmas are affected by electrical and magnetic fields. This is the main difference between a gas and a plasma.\nIs a plasma compressible?\nLiquids are non-compressible and have constant volume but can change shape. Matter in the plasma state has variable volume and shape. Plasma contains ions and electrons, both of which can move around freely.\nWhat are the six properties of solids?\nSolids have many different properties, including conductivity, malleability, density, hardness, and optical transmission, to name a few. We will discuss just a handful of these properties to illustrate some of the ways that atomic and molecular structure drives function.\nWhat are some properties of liquids?\nAll liquids show the following characteristics:\n- Liquids are almost incompressible. In liquids molecules are pretty close to each other.\n- Liquids have fixed volume but no fixed shape.\n- Liquids flow from higher to lower level.\n- Liquids have their boiling points above room temperature, under normal conditions.", "scores": {"score": 4, "score_transform_1": 5, "score_transform_2": 5, "score_transform_3": 0}}

{"id": "7905", "text": "The recording of 1972’s Exile on Main Street was notoriously hectic and haphazard for The Rolling Stones. Due to the legendarily messy management situation involving the Stones, Allen Klein, and his company ABKCO, the band members were forced to live abroad as tax exiles, giving the album its title and main conceptual theme. The south of France was settled on as the ideal location, and recording quickly began to form in the basement of Keith Richards’ rented villa, Nellcôte.\nHowever, problems arose almost immediately. Jagger was newly married to his wife Bianca, and subsequently only made scattered appearances. Bill Wyman lived a fair distance away and disliked the drug-fueled atmosphere of Nellcôte, causing him to be an infrequent presence as well. Even Richards himself could be flakey, occasionally not appearing at a session even though he resided only three floors above the recording studio. His heroin addiction had peaked during this time, and Richards usually only surfaced in the basement after the sun had gone down.\nExcept for one day when Richards uncharacteristically got up early. Most of the musicians and producers learned that showing up early was a fool’s errand (Charlie Watts drove nearly an hour every day just to get to the villa), so when Richards came in eager to start recording, he only found two of his close compatriots, producer Jimmy Miller and saxophonist Bobby Keys, present.\n“’Happy’ was something I did because I was for one time early for a session,” Richards recalled in 1982. “There was Bobby Keys and Jimmy Miller. We had nothing to do and had suddenly picked up the guitar and played this riff. So we cut it and it’s the record, it’s the same. We cut the original track with a baritone sax, a guitar and Jimmy Miller on drums. And the rest of it is built up over that track. It was just an afternoon jam that everybody said, ‘Wow, yeah, work on it.’”\nMiller was an experienced drummer and was no stranger to stepping in from behind the mixing desk on occasion. That’s him knocking out the signature cowbell intro for ‘Honky Tonk Women’, and it’s also him laying down the drum groove for ‘You Can’t Always Get What You Want’. During the times that Watts found it difficult to land on a rhythm (or during sessions when Watts just didn’t show up), Miller gamely stepped in. Exile was a prolific time for him as a musician, having appeared playing the drums on ‘Happy’, ‘Tumbling Dice’, and ‘Shine a Light’, plus contributing assorted percussion to tracks like ‘Sweet Black Angel’ and ‘Loving Cup’.\nEventually, Jagger came in to contribute backing vocals and percussion, most likely during the album’s overdub sessions in Los Angeles. But the majority of ‘Happy’ belongs to Richards, who lays down a number of guitar lines, bass, and lead vocals on the song. Keys’ baritone sax was later augmented by Jim Price’s trumpet and trombone, while Miller’s drum part was retained as well. When the final cut was mixed, the total number of Rolling Stones to appear on one of the band’s greatest songs was two: Richards and Jagger.", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}
{"id": "7912", "text": "Changes to admissions systems in the UK and Ireland simply tinker with the existing approach. They don’t address the more fundamental changes in the relationship between university education, economic and social life. We’re in the middle of a lot of changes in academia, with the fees increase for students in England eliciting a response in Scotland, and a report in Ireland suggesting changes to the “points” system of admissions to introduce more targeting. Despite the upsets these changes cause to academics — they heighten the arbitrary and distressing discontinuity in costs between Scottish and English students in St Andrews, for example — they’re actually quite superficial in the sense of not massively changing the degrees on offer or their structure. However, these would seem to be the areas in which change could be most fruitful, in response to changing patterns of life, patterns of access to information and the like. It’s hard to generate enthusiasm for this amid the problems of managing the financial structures. In other words, the fees débâcle may be masking changes that we would otherwise be well advised to make. What are these changes? First of all we need to understand what we believe about the lives and futures of the people who might attend university. For me this includes the following: People don’t know what they’re passionate about. Passionate enough to want to spend a substantial portion of their lives on it, that is. There’s a tendency to follow an “approved” path into a stable career, and this in may in some cases lead people to do the “wrong” degree as they worry about their job prospects. But if you’re going into a career in something, you have to accept that you’ll spend about half your waking life on it. It makes sense to be sure you’ll enjoy it. So we need to focus on allowing people to find their passions, which argues against too-early specialisation and for a broader course of study. My first postdoc supervisor, Chris Wadsworth, told me about 20 years ago that “it takes you 10 years to decide what you’re actually interested in.” In your mid-20s you tend to disregard statements like this and assume you know what your research interests are, but on reflection he was right: it did take me about 10 years to work out what I wanted to spend my career researching, and it wasn’t really what I was doing back then: related, yes, but definitely off to one side. I’ve also become interested in a whole range of other things that were of no interest to me back then, not least because most of them didn’t exist. If that’s true of an academic, it’s just as true of an 18-year-old undergraduate. You can have an idea what you like and what interests you, but not much more than that. We can’t teach enough. It used to be simpler: go to university, learn all the things you’ll need, then go and practice those skills with marginally upgrading for the rest of your career. I can’t think of many topics like that any more. This changes the emphasis of education: it’s not the stuff we teach that’s important, it’s the ability to upskill effectively. For that you need foundations, and you need to know the important concepts, and you need to be able to figure out the details for yourself. It’s not that these details aren’t important — in computing, for example, they’re critical — but they’re also changing so fast that there’s no way we could keep up. And in fact, if we did, we’d be doing the students a dis-service by suggesting that this isn’t a process of constant change. The jobs that people will want to do in 20 years’ time don’t exist now. Fancy a career as a web designer? Didn’t exist 20 years ago; 10 years ago it was a recognised and growing profession; lately it’s become part and parcel of graphic design. The world changes very rapidly. Even if the job you love still exists, there’s a good chance you’ll want to change to another one mid-career. Again, the ability to learn new skills becomes essential. I suspect a lot of people — including politicians — haven’t appreciated just how fast the world is changing, and that the pace of change is accelerating. You don’t have to believe in the Sigularity to believe that this has profound implications for how economies and careers work. We don’t know where the future value comes from. In a time of increased financial stress, governments fall back on supporting courses that “obviously” support economic growth: the STEM subjects in science, engineering, technology and medicine. The only problem with this as an argument is that it’s wrong. Most of the value in the digital age hasn’t come from these areas. The profits at Apple and Google pale into insignificance behind the aggregate profits of the companies (often much smaller) making content to add value to the devices and services these companies provide. I’ve argued before that this value chain is best supported by humanities graduates, not scientists and engineers. (If you want a supporting example, consider this as a proposition: the whole argument about network neutrality is essentially an argument about whether ISPs should be allowed to tax the producers and consumers of the content they transmit in terms of its end-user value, rather than in terms of its transmission cost. That’s where the value is.) Does the above have anything to suggest about changes in admissions or the structure of degrees. To me it suggests a number of things. Have broad introductory years in which students are encouraged to explore their wider interests before specialising. (The Scottish broad curriculum attempts to do this, but in sciences we don’t do it particularly well.) Focus teaching on core principles and on how these affect the evolution of tools and techniques. Also focus on students learning the tools and techniques themselves, and showing how they relate back to the taught core. Generate a set of smaller degree-lets that people can take over their career with less commitment: at a distance, in the evening, in compressed blocks, over a long period — whatever, just suitable for people to do alongside working at something else. Above all, don’t assume we (either the universities or the State) can pick winners in terms of subjects. We’re definitely in a post-industrial world, that means new intellectual territory and that what worked before won’t always work in the future. I hope computer science will continue to change the world, but I’m also completely confident that a history graduate will come up with one of the Next Big Things.", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}

{"id": "7973", "text": "An effective content architecture is key to optimizing your website for search engine optimization (SEO). And when it comes to content architecture, pillar pages play a crucial role. But here’s the burning question: how many pillar pages should your website have? Are a few enough, or do you need a vast number to succeed in the ever-competitive digital landscape?\nHow many pillar pages should you have? The optimal number of pillar pages depends on your website’s size and content breadth, but generally aim for 3-5 covering your main topics. Smaller websites might need just 1 or 2, while larger ones can benefit from several. But don’t overthink it. Start by creating one at a time.\nBut let’s go into more detail and insights to help you make an informed decision about your website’s pillar page strategy.\nUnderstanding Pillar Pages\nBefore diving into the specifics of how many pillar pages your website should have, it’s crucial to understand what a pillar page is. A pillar page is a comprehensive, in-depth piece of content that serves as the cornerstone of a topic or theme on your website. It covers all the essential aspects of the topic and provides a solid foundation for more detailed subtopics, typically covered in cluster or subtopic blog posts. Also known as the hub and spoke SEO, where the pillar pages are the hubs and blog posts are the pokes. A well-structured pillar page is crucial for organizing your website’s content and establishing your authority on a particular subject.\nTo illustrate the concept further, let’s consider an example:\nImagine you have a website about fitness. One of your pillar pages could be a comprehensive guide to strength training. This pillar page will cover all the fundamental concepts, exercises, and techniques related to strength training. It would provide a thorough overview of the topic, acting as your website’s main hub for information on strength training. Subsequently, you could create cluster or subtopic blog posts that delve deeper into specific strength training areas, such as exercises for specific muscle groups, recovery tips, or training programs.\nBy structuring your content this way, with a pillar page as the main hub and supporting cluster or subtopic posts linking to it, you create a logical hierarchy within your website’s content architecture.

To better understand this, look at some examples of effective pillar pages.\nEffective Pillar Page Examples\nWhen creating pillar pages for your website, it’s important to understand how they can effectively enhance your content architecture and improve your SEO. Effective pillar pages often comprise comprehensive guides, ultimate resources, or definitive overviews. These pages cover a particular topic’s essential aspects, providing a strong foundation for more detailed subtopics or cluster posts that delve deeper into specific techniques or tactics.\nFor example, if you have a website about digital marketing, one of your pillar pages could be a complete guide to SEO. This pillar page would cover everything from keyword research to on-page optimization and link-building strategies. Another pillar page could focus on social media marketing strategies, discussing content creation, community management, and ad targeting.\nCreating these pillar pages establishes a powerful content architecture that enhances the user experience and improves SEO. Users can easily find comprehensive information on a specific topic, while search engines recognize your website as a valuable resource in your industry. This can lead to higher search engine rankings, increased organic traffic, and a stronger online presence.\nComparison of Effective Pillar Page Examples\n|Complete Guide to SEO\n|Keyword research, on-page optimization, link building, SEO tools\n|Social Media Marketing Strategies\n|Content creation, community management, ad targeting, analytics\nThe table above shows that the pillar pages offer comprehensive coverage of their respective topics within the broader digital marketing domain.

Incorporate relevant keywords in your headings to improve SEO.\n- Subheadings: Break up your pillar pages with subheadings to organize the content further.

This helps search engines understand the hierarchy and relevance of your content, improving your website’s discoverability and ranking. Additionally, it makes it easier for users to navigate your site and find the information they’re looking for, increasing engagement and reducing bounce rates.\nAn effective content architecture also facilitates internal linking, allowing you to connect related pillar pages, cluster posts, and supporting content. This interlinking strengthens the overall structure of your website and helps search engines recognize the relationships between different pieces of content. It also encourages visitors to explore more of your content, increasing the likelihood of conversions and creating a seamless user experience.\nRemember your content’s relevancy and logical flow when organizing your pillar pages and cluster posts. Each pillar page should cover a specific topic comprehensively, while cluster posts should provide more specific information and support the pillars. This targeted organization ensures that your content is efficient and easy to navigate and maximizes the impact of your SEO efforts.\nOverall, establishing a strong content architecture is essential for the success of your pillar page strategy. It improves the user experience, boosts SEO performance, and helps search engines understand and index your content effectively. You can create a comprehensive and authoritative website that resonates with search engines and users by implementing a coherent structure that connects your pillar pages and cluster posts.\nIn conclusion, the number of pillar pages your website should have depends on various factors, such as size, niche, and content goals.

However, there are also differences that you will have to wrap your head around if you want to shine in your new career, and this is a subject you can read more about below.\nFirstly, it is vital to remember that as a qualified academic you bring a lot to the table in the private sector. In fact, you have a wealth of transferable skills including things like self-motivation, the ability to completed projects to a high standard, writing, presenting, researching, and hitting deadlines that are all valued within the commercial world.\nBe sure to know your own value as you transition from academic to the private sector.\nI say this not to give you an ego boost, but so you can remember that you are a valuable resource and moving from academic into the private sector is not about going cap in hand and hoping that some employer will take pity on you enough to throw you a bone. In fact, if you can show how the skills you possess can directly affect the running and bottom line of your prospective employers business they should be able to realize that you are an asset worth the investment.\nIn particular, academics are used to working within a very stable and defined infrastructure. Yes, sometimes it can be frustrating, and there is a lot of red-tape to get through, but on the whole, you know who to go to if you want a particular resource or a task completed.\nDepending on the company that you are employed by, this may not be the case in the private sector. In fact, you may be in a position in which you have to oversee the creation of a coherent infrastructure including organizing things like sourcing materials, locating manufacturing facilities, and dealing with logistics and warehousing solutions as what is in place is not working.\nThis, of course, can be a huge change for the academic who is used to having facilities or buying expert on hand to arrange the practical side of things.\nAnother concern you may come across as an academic in the private sector is the issue with motivation. Academics are often motivated by altruistic factors such as searching for the truth, or an answer to a particular question, as well as looking for things that can improve and inform the world in which we live in some way.\nWhat you may find when you head into the private sector, especially if you choose a commercial role, is that all the altruistic reasons are less important and monetary reasons become the driving force.\nThis can create some issues for academics, and if this is a major stumbling block for you, I encourage you to consider posts in the nonprofit, or R&D sectors. Although it is also possible to take a long hard look at the area you are in and draw out all how it helps people live better lives to give you a motivating force that is a little more in line with what you are used to.", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}

It was a bummer because now I'm afraid to do it again, but I swear, I think things are still in my face,\" Khloé said during an episode of “Kocktails With Khloé.”\n5 / 10\nKhloé’s younger sister Kylie Jenner has also had a long journey with facial fillers. After denying her use of lip filler for quite a while, Kylie finally revealed in 2015 that she was getting temporary filler. Then in 2018, fans noticed Kylie was looking more natural and she revealed that she had made the decision to get them completely dissolved. Although she didn’t share the reason behind the change, it ultimately wasn’t long until she decided to get filler again.\n6 / 10\nMelanie Griffith says she didn't realize how drastically fillers had changed her appearance until people started talking about it in the media. She ultimately decided to go to another doctor and over the course of several years, they worked on dissolving what had been injected into her face. \"About seven years ago I started doing injections, and now for the past two, three years, I have been getting it dissolved - it takes a while. I didn't see it until people started saying, 'Oh my God, what has she done?' I was so hurt I went to a different doctor and he started dissolving all of this s--t that this other woman doctor put in,\" Melanie told Porter magazine. “I had done to my lips too. So awful. Hopefully, I look more normal now.\"\n7 / 10\nAfter Simon Cowell began getting facial filler and Botox, he admits there came a point when he felt \"like something out of a horror film.\" When he realized his son Eric was scared of his appearance, he knew it was time to change things. \"There was a stage where I might have gone a bit too far. I saw a picture of me from 'before' the other day, and didn't recognise it as me first of all. Eric was in hysterics. Enough was enough. There is no filler in my face at all now. Zero,\" Simon told The Sun. \"There was a phase where everyone was having their faces pumped full of this and the other. But actually, for me now, a lot of it comes down to healthy eating and drinking tons of water.\"\n8 / 10\nWhile Yolanda Hadid was struggling with Lyme disease, she discovered that her breast implants were leaking silicone into her body. She made the decision to remove them and later decided to also get rid of any injections in her face. \"Living in a body free of breast implants, fillers, botox, extensions and all the bulls--t I thought I needed in order to keep up with what society conditioned me to believe what a sexy woman should look like until the toxicity of it all almost killed me,\" Yolanda wrote on Instagram. \"Your health is your wealth so please make educated decisions, research the partial information you’re given by our broken system before putting anything foreign in your body.\"\n9 / 10\nWhen Amy Schumer first got facial fillers, she immediately decided they weren’t for her. Thankfully, she was able to get them dissolved and shared the process with fans on Instagram, joking that she looked like Disney villain Maleficent. \"I tried getting fillers. Turns out I was already full,\" she wrote in a now-deleted post. \"Thank God you can dissolve them I looked like #malificent.\"\n10 / 10\nEarly in her career Jessica Simpson decided that lip filler wasn’t for her. Back in 2006, she explained that she had previously gotten filler but disliked it so much that she let it fade away. \"I had that Restylane stuff. But it fades -- it went away in like four months. My lips are back to what they were. Thank God! It looked fake to me. I didn't like that,\" Jessica told Glamour.", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

{"id": "8101", "text": "NZ group tax relief for company losses – some valuable lessons\nNew Zealand tax law contains a detailed set of rules that allow companies that incur tax losses to share and transfer those losses for the benefit of other profit-making entities within the same tax group. Supplementary tax practice rules also apply from the Inland Revenue Department (“IRD”) – refer to SPS 17/03 (IRD’s Standard Practice Statement, effective, 14 December 2017).\nMany of these rules are permissive, yet in my experience many companies, and practitioners, fail to maximise the advantages that are available, or just get it wrong. Optimising available choices to reduce the corporate tax bill, and related cash outflows, is quite simply a ‘no-brainer’.\nThis article highlights some of the Valuable Lessons and Options that are available, and includes:\n- Loss offset methods – automatic transfer election, or subvention payment?\n- What is an eligible New Zealand loss offset group? Less than 100% wholly owned companies, and, resident and non-resident companies, and, part year entities;\n- Advantages with making subvention payment loss offsets;\n- How to properly effect a transfer of tax losses?\n- Some traps, tips, and lessons.\nLoss offset methods – automatic transfer election, or subvention payment?\nNZ tax law provides for two methods to offset losses within an eligible group of companies.\nOne involves an automatic offset of the loss against the net taxable income of a profit company (by means of an election lodged by the loss company with the IRD). In this method, the loss company can use its current year losses, or, it can use prior year losses that it has carried forward legitimately.\nThe second method involves what is termed as a ‘subvention payment’, whereby the profit company makes a payment to the loss company to bear or share in that company’s loss. This subvention payment is by agreement between the parties, and can be any amount not exceeding the amount of the losses that are transferred.\nA common approach is to use a combination of these methods, with the subvention payment set at the 28% corporate tax rate (as if the profit company is discharging its tax on its offset profits), and with the 72% balance offset by automatic transfer.\nThis loss offset practice combining both of the available loss transfer methods is a conventional practice, however, variations are allowable that may yield commercial benefits to the entities (see below).\nWhat is an eligible New Zealand loss offset group?\nThe loss company and the profit company must essentially be common owned as to at least 66%. NZ tax law contains detailed ownership measurement rules, and these must be examined, however common share / stock ownership rights most typically give rise to common ownership. The two entities may be parent / subsidiary, or sister companies.\nThe loss company may also be a foreign company with a NZ branch business , (but cannot be a company that is dual resident in New Zealand and another country as this invokes specific anti-avoidance measures around double-dipping losses). Advantages exist for foreign loss companies under the subvention payment offset method (refer on).\nPrior year losses in the loss company are subject to NZ ownership continuity rules of at least 49% continuous ownership from the time of the loss to the time of offset. Should ownership in the companies breach this continuity threshold, the loss offset rules do contain provisions allowing part-year loss offsets that enable losses carried forward and incurred up to the time of a significant ownership change to be utilised by way of existing group offset. Similar part year apportionment rules allow new companies acquired into a group to offset post-acquisition losses to the acquiring group, or, post-acquisition profits of newly acquired companies to be loss relieved.\nAdvantages with making subvention payment loss offsets\nSubvention payments within NZ’s group loss offset regime can yield advantages for organisations. Because subvention payments can be made at any amounts including dollar-for-dollar of the loss offset amount, this facilitates the transfer of value from one entity to another without adverse tax consequences. The transaction is also not a dividend.\nFull dollar-for-dollar subvention payments may be used as funding support for loss companies. Alternatively, subvention payments may be satisfied by offsetting debts of the loss company from past advances made by the profit company (or other group members).\nIn the example above, Profit Coy is able to make a subvention payment of up to a maximum of $500,000 to the Loss Coy to effect the transfer of $500,000 losses.\nForeign group companies, with NZ loss operations can benefit from full subvention payments. In this scenario, losses incurred within a NZ operation of a foreign company can be transferred to a NZ profit company that is a subsidiary of the foreign group (the two entities both form members of the same NZ group). Group loss offsets in this scenario can occur through the NZ profit company making full subvention payments to the loss company NZ branch (up to the actual amount of the losses being grouped). In turn, the NZ branch (loss company) can repatriate the proceeds of the subvention payment out of NZ to the combined entities’ foreign owners free of any NZ withholding taxes.\nHow to properly effect a transfer of tax losses?\nProcedural requirements to properly effect a valid loss offset election must be adhered to. In short, the loss company must file its election to offset losses to group company(ies) within the permitted timeframes. Typically, this can be completed with the income tax return, or by separate letter request. The deadline is no later than 31 March following the end of the company’s year of offset, or, if allowed within the IRD’s discretion such further time by extension.\nSubvention payments must be made within the same timeframe – no later than 31 March following the year of loss offset.\nWhere amended assessments are made by the IRD, or either company amends their taxable income or loss, such changes will impact on the loss offset election lodged. The IRD will consider the impact of such changes and decide on how revised elections may be made.\nTypically, the loss offset amount is a stated fixed amount. Sometimes this may not be possible (eg., delays in the profit company tax calculation), however the IRD will accept an election that refers to an amount that is capable of identification as a specific amount. IRD’s SPS 17/03 gives an example of an election that the tax loss to be offset is such amount as would reduce the profit company’s net income to nil.\nSubvention payments can be by payment in cash, its equivalent, or by certain accounting entries. Accounting entries must cause a genuine crediting in the payee loss company’s account, or set off of a pre-existing obligation (eg., loan advance funding by the profit company).\nSome traps, tips, and lessons\nLoss transfer risks to profit company – preserving tax credits\nI have observed serious blunders by corporates and practitioners alike with loss transfers mishandled and resulting in the forfeiture of valuable tax credits. Because loss election transfers are irrevocable, traps exist where elections are made ahead of finalising the standalone corporate tax position of the profit company. Where the net income of the profit company is identified, it is also imperative that the final tax liability is calculated that takes into account all available non-refundable tax credits, particularly foreign tax credits as these will be forfeited with no benefit where all it’s profits are loss offset.\nNegative impact on profit company’s imputation credit balance\nWhere a profit company pays less or no tax because it benefits from group loss transfers, a mis-match will arise between its reserves (retained earnings) and its imputation credit balance. From a wider economic group perspective this mis-match is fair since the overall consolidated reserves are netted off, however on a standalone basis the profit company mis-match will impair its ability to pay dividends that carry full tax credits from imputation.\nThis lack of imputation tax credits is a timing trade-off since shareholders will suffer tax on deriving dividends (withholding taxes for foreign shareholders), given no tax outflow at the parent profit company.\nAchieving an equitable outcome where minority interests exist\nLosses can be transferred between companies that are less than 100% commonly owned, since an eligible group need only comprise shareholding commonality of 66%.\nWhere a JV exists, or simply spread shareholdings, but with one majority shareholder with at least 66% ownership, then loss offsets trigger issues of equity between the stakeholders.\nIn the above scenario, the jointly owned loss company is surrendering its losses to the majority shareholder group (via its profit subsidiary). Should this loss transfer be by automatic loss transfer, or, by combination with a subvention payment payable by the profit company to the jointly held loss company? The losses transferred will be utilised to the benefit of the majority shareholder, while the joint loss company will forfeit any future value for the losses transferred (that is, future profits of the joint loss company will bear tax at 28% without any carry forward loss shelter).\nA range of factors will influence this determination, for example, the future profit projections (and timings) of the jointly held loss company; the distribution policy of the company and its shareholders; the tax status of the shareholders (individual vs corporate vs resident or foreign, etc). Further questions arise, whether any subvention payment should be at the 28% tax rate, or a lower or higher rate? Arguably, the shareholders are ‘invested’ in the subvention payment at their respective 70% / 30% interests.\nIn this scenario, the jointly owned company is in profit (rather than losses), with the majority shareholder’s subsidiary in losses, and so a group loss offset will result in the majority shareholder surrendering its losses in favour of the jointly owned company, and minority shareholder (to the extent of its 30% interest).\nThe factors noted above will need to be considered again, albeit with ‘flipped’ perspective given the changed profit and loss entities and ownership. As raised earlier (Negative impact on profit company’s imputation credit balance), the minority shareholder will likely be mindful of any adverse impact on the ability of the jointly held company to distribute dividends with imputation tax credits attached.\nAgreements to share in losses by subvention payments\nThe subvention payment method requires that the loss company ‘agree’ with the profit company that the profit company shall bear its tax losses in return for a payment, and so this wording is often embodied in an annual Subvention Payment and Loss Offset Agreement between the parties. However, this agreement need not be in writing, and therefore corporate pragmatics may be best served by adopting a generic agreement among a number of group companies that provides for the sharing of losses if and when they should occur, at such amounts as determined at the time, but not exceeding the loss transfer amount.\nAdherence to the election process\nAs canvassed earlier, it is important that companies follow and adhere to the statutory requirements to ensure valid loss transfer elections are made, including late elections and extensions of time.\nAccounting for tax loss transfers\nThe accounting treatment of tax loss transfers is not specifically addressed in NZ IAS 12. A useful reference to guidelines on the financial accounting treatment of tax loss transfers and subvention payments can be found in Audit New Zealand’s publication https://auditnz.govt.nz/publications-resources/tax/tax-loss-transfers\nFrom the above, it can be seen that there are many factors at play when it comes to maximising your tax position when dealing with group loss transfers. Some specific options that are unique to NZ tax law are available, and essential planning and compliance checks should be examined closely to optimise your position.\nCAVEAT: While the above commentary provides insights and tips, as always, every scenario carries its own facts and circumstances that will influence the position variously, and therefore it is imperative that you seek specific advice to your own situation.\n It is noted that wholly owned NZ companies my ‘elect’ treatment as a Consolidated Group which is a specific regime that treats all entities simply as one company with tax consolidation of all income and expenditure. Pro’s and con’s do exist with electing to enter this consolidation regime which should be reviewed carefully.\n In the absence of such loss grouping, the profit company would ordinarily pay taxes, thus generating imputation credits with which it could impute an outflow dividend and avoid any dividend withholding taxes.", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

{"id": "8134", "text": "Norwich City have been a surprise package on their return to the Premier League and possess the weaponry to cause West Ham problems on Saturday.\nDaniel Farke’s side have expressed an attacking brand of football on their reintroduction to the top-tier of English football. An opening-day defeat at Anfield should not be discredited with the performance they displayed and an impressive 3-1 win over Newcastle United followed.\nNarrowly losing to Chelsea last time out was systematic of the way they want to play; offensively excellent, but defensively shaky. With West Ham bringing a similar style to the table, it has the making of a high-scoring exhibition.\nSo, what should the Hammers be cautious of when these two sides meet at London Stadium on Saturday?\n1. Teemu Pukki’s prolific nature\nPukki has been the star of the Premier League thus far with five goals to his name from three appearances, and with West Ham’s defensive frailties, you wouldn’t bet against him adding to his tally on Saturday.\nThe Finnish striker certainly knows how to finish and it is imperative that the Irons’ centre-back pairing do not gift the 29-year-old any space or opportunities in or around the box, because he will capitalise.\n2. Todd Cantwell’s creative spark\nThe aforementioned Pukki may be getting most of the individual plaudits, but Cantwell has been just as impressive.\nThe England playmaker is excellent with the ball at his feet and tends to glide past players with ease. If allowed time and space on the ball, he will punish you.\nThe Hammers will have to remain firmly tight to their star creator and you suspect Declan Rice will have to keep him quiet if Pellegrini’s side want success at the weekend.\n3. Dangerous, attacking full-backs\nBoth Max Aarons and Jamal Lewis are a huge part of Farke’s philosophy and overlapping full-backs are something West Ham often struggle to cope with.\nAll you have to do is look at Wolves at home last season. Matt Doherty and Jonny Otto had a field day at London Stadium and if the Hammers haven’t learned their lesson, it will be the same story again this weekend.\n4. Goalscoring impetuous\nThe Canaries are not afraid to attack, no matter who they are up against. They have already played Liverpool and Chelsea so far – and on both occasions played the same, offensive style we became accustomed to seeing in the Championship.\nThe impetuous is on Pellegrini’s men to attack and be on the front foot, and that could play into Norwich’s hands.\nThe attacking quality they have is good enough to score against any defence in the Premier League, and if we expose ourselves at the back, they will take advantage.\n5. Stretching the game\nWhether it’s Emiliano Buendia, Cantwell or Marco Stiepermann, the Canaries always possess a threat in midfield and their ability to stretch the play at London Stadium could be damaging.\nSince moving to Stratford, the middle of the park is often vacant for opposition players to glide through, and the more the game gets stretched, the more it will suit Norwich and their attacking players.", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}
{"id": "8136", "text": "Patience, prayer and sacrificial love will mark the lives of true followers of Jesus.\n:00 You're listening to a live recording from Westside church in bend, Oregon. Thanks for joining us.\n00:06 My name's Steve. I'm one of the senior pastors here and, and glad to see everyone that's watching online as well. digitally. It's good to have you with us. Also, we're finishing up a series that we've been on in the book of James. So James, the half brother of Jesus, wrote a letter to the churches that were the believers that were scattered across, the Roman empire. And we've been working our way, over these last five weeks through this letter. And this letter is, hard hitting, I don't know, for those of you that have been here for most of the series you had you you've, since that, like there's a lot of lists in James of what you should do and what you should not do. And, and did you guys know that Martin Luther, did not think James should be included in the can of scripture, that it shouldn't be in our Bibles, Martin Luther, the reformer, and the reason that he felt so strongly about that is because he knew that people would use the letter of James to bring condemnation and shame into people's lives because of all the dos and don'ts all the, this is, this is how you should live.\n01:10 This is how you should live. That kind of thing, and people. And he knew that the church now, of course we haven't done that in the last few hundred years, but maybe just a little. And so, as we read, as we kind of finish up this series, I wanna remind us that the reason why we do, what James is asking us to do in James is not so that we might earn God's favor, cuz that's what Luther was afraid would happen. That we not, we wouldn't read the pages of scripture and go, oh, well, if God, if I want God to love me, I need to do certain things. He loves you full stop. There's there's nothing that you have to do to earn. God's love for you at all. If you've ever heard that from any other preacher or church or anything, they're lying, it's not true.\n02:02 God loves you. Just like you. Like he created you. He loves you. You guys aren't getting it. I mean, I'm looking at it and they're like, I don't know, is that really true, Steve? Because I've been in church a long time and that's not what I feel. That's the problem. God loves you. And if, and, and, and we can read through James and we can start to think, Mmm man, but I better, I better live, right?\n03:07 His last commandment to his followers. Love one another, just as I have loved you, no greater love than this can be shown. That's that's the call for us. So as we finish up James, I want you to be reminded that that it's all, it all flows out of the love God has for us and our desire to live according to his word, because he loves us so much. And I wanna, I wanna try to live up to that standard. I wanna try to live into the grace that God has given us. I want to do that because he loves me so much. And so as we close out this series, we're gonna be looking at James chapter five. If you have a Bible, go ahead and open it up to James chapter five, verse seven. We're gonna be looking at the last 14 verses of his letter to the church.\n03:53 And in it, he, he says this phrase so many times, brothers and sisters, and occasionally he puts dear in front of a dear brothers and sisters. And I want you to think of this, this letter that James writes. I want you to think of it in the context of community, that what he's saying about these, these principles is all, it all works better in relationships with one another. And he does this throughout this, last few, this last section, dear brothers and sisters. I want you to do three things. He's gonna tell us to do three things. And li I can imagine James sitting at a, you know, I don't know, did they have tables back then? They had tables, right? It's not that far long ago. I dunno. Anyway, sitting at you. I can just envision him just thinking, okay, how do I want to end this letter to the churches?\n04:40 And he's, and there's, I, I, I can feel this overwhelming love that he has for the church. And he's thinking that there's three more things. I just wanna make sure that they get and that they live into this. even after I'm gone, I think is what James is thinking. And three things that he's gonna encourage us to do. Persevere, pray and restore, persevere, pray and restore. Look at verse seven, dear brothers and sisters be patient as you wait for the Lord's return. And if his words don't have more, even more application today, it had been a few decades, since Jesus rose from the dead, when he's writing this and he's telling them be patient for the Lord's return, and I'm thinking, James, you had no idea what you were writing, man. It's been 2000 plus years and he's, and, but I think he, I think he saw something that he knew that believers would need to have patience as they wait for the Lord's return.\n05:41 Consider the farmers who patiently wait for the rains in the fall. And in the spring, they eagerly look for the valuable harvest to ripen you. Two must be patient take courage for the coming of the Lord is near don't grumble about each other.\n06:33 I'm glad he said that you can see how the Lord was kind to job at the end. So if you've ever read job, it doesn't feel like God is very kind. God allowed Satan to take away everything that job had. His family, his possessions, everything, but in the end, God was faithful. That's what James is reminding us for. The Lord is full of tenderness and mercy. But most of all, my brothers and sisters never taken oath by heaven or earth or anything else. Just say a simple yes or no so that you will not sin and be condemned. So let's look at this for a moment. This idea of perseverance. did any of you ever take long road trips with your family as a kid who talk about the need for perseverance? I have an older brother, older sister and a younger brother, and we, every summer we would take a trip somewhere, in a little tiny, one of those station wagon things, you know, with the, wood paneling, we had that.\n07:30 And, I was, I'm a kid of the seventies. And so, we would take these long road trips and I mean, my siblings, we just got along so great. We never argued. We never fought. It was just perfect bliss actually. Yeah, we didn't have DVDs. We didn't have phones. We didn't have anything to distract us. Mom is trying to get us to stop fighting in the back seat long enough so that her and dad could have some peace and quiet, never happened. This is how we grew up. And I remember this one road trip. we went to the coast, so it wasn't very long road trip, but doesn't matter one hour is too long of a road trip\n08:12 And I remember I was at breakfast at this restaurant, all of us. And I look across, the room and there's this other table, there's this family. They look so happy.\n09:19 And that's okay. Persevere. And then he talks about suffering and he uses the example of job and he's like, he's just he's listen. You're not gonna, I mean, if you, if you tap out too quickly on relationships with one another and with God, you're, you're going to not see the goodness of the Lord, the way that you might, if you persevere, he just keeps holds steady. Don't don't run. Just stick with it. Imagine a farmer, right? He uses example of a farmer who, who is faithfully planted, watered their crop. And they have no control after that. Do they? They have no control of what happens with the weather or acts of God as it's called, right. They, the feeling of helplessness and we can feel that way. And so what happens so often is we do what James tells us not to do is we make oaths. Did you ever wonder if you read this? Like, that feels like a little, like a little tangent, like, oh, what does oaths have to do with being patient and endurance and what he's saying? So, I mean, for example, let me just, let me just, I promise, I promise you that I'm going to be here on time tomorrow morning for work at 9:00 AM.\n10:30 I promise, can I guarantee that I'm gonna be here at 9:00 AM tomorrow for work? I'll do everything I possibly can to make that happen, but I cannot guarantee it that's a silly example, but we make, we make promises guarantees because we want to have some sense of control. And, and James is saying, listen, that when you do that, you're actually acknowledging that you don't, you're not dependent on God who gives the reign to the, just and the unjust. And so he's saying persevere, let God be in charge. And he is so counterintuitive to this way of thinking in our world. But I've learned this as I've gotten older and boy, am I getting older? God doesn't always come through for us when we want him to. But eventually he comes through.\n11:30 I have to believe this. Otherwise suffering doesn't make sense. And perseverance is impossible. I believe I've chosen to believe that God is faithful and that he will make all things right. He will make all things new that he is working even right now to restore the things that are broken in my life. He is doing that. And I'm believing that he is faithful. That even if it's at the end, I will see the goodness of God in the land of the living. I believe that. And I'm gonna persevere to the end to see it. the second thing that James talks to us about is prayer. Look at, verse 13. Are any of you suffering hardships?\n12:15 Anybody? Yeah, you should pray. Are any of you happy today? Anybody, few of you, I can see you should sing. Praises are any of you sick? You should call for the elders of the church to come and pray over. You anointing you with oil in the name of the Lord. Why does he, why does he move from perseverance to prayer? Because what happens? And I've experienced this in my own life. When you suffer long enough, you begin to disbelieve in the power of prayer. You begin to believe that God is not listening. If you suffer long enough and hard enough, you begin to doubt the very presence of God in hearing your prayers and answering them. You begin to doubt that God is with you. And so he's saying, listen, as you persevere, don't stop praying. Don't stop because you'll be tempted to stop praying.\n13:13 You'll be tempted to start believing that God is done. That he's, that he's out of office that he's not listening. And James is like, don't stop praying, such a prayer per a persevering prayer offered in faith will heal the sick and the Lord will make you well. And if you have committed any sins, you will be forgiven, confess your sins to each other and pray for each other so that you may be healed. The earnest prayer of a righteous person is great power and produces wonderful results. Elijah was as human as we are. And yet when he prayed earnestly that no rain would fall, none fell for three and a half years. I think he should have been more specific about the timing Elijah. Then when he prayed again, the sky sent down rain and the earth began to yield its crops. The power of prayer, especially among the people who have suffered deeply, cannot be underestimated.\n14:11 Suzanne and I and our, and two of our sons, we were in London for part of my sabbatical that I just returned, from, from about two weeks ago. And we were in London. I'd never been to west minister Abby. So, I found out that you could visit west minister Abby at seven 30 in the morning for free\n15:19 But then when I started to pray the prayers that were on the page and I heard the priest praying and reading scripture and, and it was all of a sudden it, the holy spirit came into this place and begin to minister to us. And through us, the power of prayer, corporate prayer together with other believers, it makes a difference in me and around me. It makes a, it will, it will make a difference in you and around you prayer, the power of prayer. And I've been challenged lately to not pray my prayers. Do you know what I mean by that? I've got a lot of needs. I've got a lot of things I want. I've got a lot of, things that I'm other people I'm praying for. I've got a lot of my prayers, but I've been challenged to pray God prayers that might sound like over spiritual.\n16:12 What does that mean? It simply means I want to discover what God is already doing and pray according to his will. I wanna pray a what God, what, what are you saying to your church? God, what are you saying to our country? God, what are you saying to our world? Because there's a lot of noise out there. There's a lot of opinions about, how we should be thinking about things. And I, I want to discover what God thinks and pray according to God's will. And James says that those types of prayers are effective. Why are they effective?\n16:49 Because they're, God's, he's already doing that. He wants us to pray according to his will. And then you can, you can almost be like guarantee that those things, those prayers are gonna happen, cuz you're praying according to God's wills. And then James moves from prayer to confession and he says the prayer of a righteous person when I've read that, I've always thought, oh, I wonder who that is.\n18:22 And so confession. When was the last time you confessed? I told the team, earlier this week, I think, I think we should put a confessional in the church. Any Catholics? Any, any Catholics in the house? Yeah. Yeah. I love Catholics. my nephew actually converted from Protestantism to Catholicism. It's usually the other way around. but, but he went the other way and one of the reasons was this idea of confession, someone always available to hear your confession in confidence.\n19:00 And and I appreciate that. James said confess your sends to each other, not to a priest. So I have a little bit of a disagreement about that. It has to be a priest. And the reason why is because it's way harder, it's let me just say this it's way easier to confess your sins to God or a priest. Why is that? Why is it so much easier? Cuz God already knows your stuff. So you're not, you're not breaking the news to him. And we all kind of, we all kind of think our priest does too. He or she knows more than they're letting on\n20:16 And it's risky. I get that. And you know, I'm not gonna have us turn to one another today and confess your sins to one another. James says that, but that I don't think that's what he's, he, he doesn't wanna create an unsafe church, but we've also lost the art of confession in our gatherings. And so what might that look like for you and for me,\n20:41 Has any of you ever wronged any, as someone else said something you shouldn't say did something you shouldn't do and you felt kind of bad about it. And you're like, I sh maybe I should say something. Yes. That's called confession, going to someone and like, listen I'm so I blew it. I said this, I didn't mean to say this. This happens. This happens more regularly than I wanted to between me and our staff here. And the what reason I say that is because I, if I, if I catch myself saying something that I shouldn't say, I, I have to it's, it's a non-optional in my life. I have to go to that person. I cannot not go to that person. It's just a rule that I have that I, I don't wanna live with UN anything unconfessed. You know what typically the response is, I didn't even notice that you did something wrong. I'm like, well, thank you. But I need to do this. Cuz I felt a check in my spirit that I wronged you and I want to make it right.\n21:43 What is it about our culture that we don't like owning up to stuff? What is it? Why, why are we blame? Why do we blame everyone else? James is like, listen, there's a judge waiting at the door, man. He knows your stuff, confess it own up to it. Maybe you're part of a group of friends that, you have a good relationship and, and you know how it is, right. If someone does something and is kinda like, Ooh, Ooh, with their friend group and like, oh, they shouldn't have done that. if you have a, if you have a good friend group, somebody will call you on it and then hopefully your response is yeah. Yeah. I, my bad I'm so sorry, please forgive me.\n22:33 Please forgive me. I blew it parents. Oh parents, this is a tough one. So we have every opportu. We have opportunities from the time my, our children are two, to forgive because they blow it every single day they do something they shouldn't do. Don't touch, don't touch, don't touch. And you, and, and there's this idea of forgiveness and what happens parents when you blow it the first time and I made this a practice. The first time I apologize to my kids for something I said to them,\n23:32 And the last thing is to restore. Look at verse 19, my dear brothers and sisters. If someone among you wanders away from the truth and is brought back, you can be sure that whoever brings the center back will save that person from death and bring about the forgiveness of many sins. I love this. So, so much this idea of, oh, I love that James uses this word wander. I am I instead of thinking of, I mean, he uses the word sinner too, and I know the church really loves that word a lot, but I, I like the word wanderer. It's, it's just intriguing to me, like to think of people who have left the faith as people who are wandering, any of you ever been lost in the woods or in a city or something. And I was in forest gro forest. Do you get lost in forest Grove?\n24:25 I've never, I'd never been there. I went on a run. It was supposed to be a four miler, ended up total being a little over almost nine miles, a little over eight miles cuz I got lost and I got completely turned around. And so I, I, I'm literally thinking I'm going back to my hotel over here and my hotel is over there, but I'm convinced, but I just thought I was on the right trail, you know? And, and so I'm, I'm I'm com and then I realize about mile four\n25:10 I'm like, yeah, yeah, I know. Do you know how do I get? And they, they were so nice. They were like, yeah, you do this and this and this. I was so far away that I remembered about half of what they said. So about halfway back to my hotel, I had to stop again and ask someone else, Hey, where's the, where's my hotel. And they helped me. You know what? They didn't do you fool\n26:47 With this principle of perseverance, patience and restoration, do you know all three of those happen better in community than in isolation? Think about it for a moment. Perseverance doesn't happen in isolation. You will give up. If you feel alone, if you feel rejected, you will not make it. You have to be in relationship. Community connection. Connection will help you persevere, help you keep going. Now I know we can all pray by ourselves and please do. That's great. But the most powerful times of prayer that I've experienced in my life is when I've been praying with another brother or sister and I've been, or in a small group of people and we've been contending for God's will to be done. Those are powerful moments of prayer and confession, man. It's so easy to confess our sins to God and so much harder to confess to other people, but so powerful when we do that in community. And Paul said that we should all do the work of evangelism, which means that we all should have open hearts to those who have wandered. But can you imagine a community like ours, where every single person that walks in that gets connected to somebody from west side feels this love and acceptance and embrace the power of that.\n28:14 I've experienced this personally for more, for more and more people all the time that when it's one of the most powerful demonstrations of agape love, which is means unconditional love. It's the love that God has for us. It's called a godbe love. And when you see this happen in your life, it'll changes everything. When I've wronged someone, my wife, a dear friend, a coworker, and I go to them and I repent. I apologize. I ask them for forgiveness and you know, they're and when they, and when they respond this way, I love you. I forgive you. And sometimes the embrace follows just you don't get that anywhere else. There's no other environment where you get that kind of agape, unconditional love and acceptance. The kind that Jesus had for us, it is the most powerful demonstration of love is when we forgive those who have wronged us,\n29:26 The context of community. So let's do it this fall. We are launching our community groups and we believe you guys. We believe that literally everyone at our church should be in community of some kind, whether that's one on one in a small group, whatever it is we need, we need to be together in some fashion. I wanna encourage you. Don't walk alone, don't suffer alone. Don't pray alone. Find a community of people that you can do life with. Maybe you have a community right now and you should just start a community group with them. This fall start connecting with them. I wanna encourage you to do that today. You can sign up. you can get more information. You can ask some questions, pastor Dave, who's gonna be out in the atrium. Wanna encourage you to go and talk to him about how to get part of a community group, how to launch one? I think it's important. Well, let me finish up and then Lindsay's gonna lead us in a song and we're gonna take communion together.\n30:26 So, after the prayer time, it at the west minister, Abby, they invited us. If we wanted to partake of communion together into a small little room with the same priest. And so Suzanne and I were like, why not? Let's do it. We're not Anglican, but they didn't say that we had to be. And, and so we went into this small room and there were about another five or so people that came in, so it was dozens of us or so in this small space and the priest is getting all of the elements ready, you know? And, and I, and, and so we're standing, there's a whole liturgical thing as well. It's an actual little service. And so there's times to pray times to stand times to sit, et cetera. And he then at the end, the end, he prepares the wafer and it's just this wafer.\n31:09 And he breaks off a piece and you hold your hand like this and he drops it in and he blesses you and you take it. And then the, and then the J I was, I was curious is how they were gonna do that, you know, with post COVID and everything. And so it is what I imagine it was going to be a cup, the wine in the cup. And he, with a, with a, a cloth, he went around and each person took from the same cup.\n31:40 Nobody looks okay, nobody's nobody's sweating or anything. All right. You know him, I go. And, he comes around, he serves the juice to each person wipes. It turns the cup. If you've been part of a service like that, you kind know how it goes, but, and he gets to me and, he looks right at me, like, just like, and I was thinking like, all of you think, man, this guy knows everything about me right now.", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

The organization is a publicly listed company on the Athens Stock Exchange, and it is a member of the Hellenic Network of Corporate Social Responsibility.\nOver the years, Intralot has steadily grown to become the global market leader in lottery products. Though the company has struggled with revenue growth at times, its expansion has been steady throughout which has resulted in its position as the top lottery products provider in the world. Intralot acquired a 35% stake in Gidani, the South African National Lottery operator in December 2009. This was followed by a 49% stake in Bit8, a Maltese gaming company in 2010. In 2017, the company signed a contract with the Illinois Lottery to provide a new central gaming system and related services. It announced a year-on-year revenue growth of 15.1% and EBITDA growth of 3.6% in H1 2017. In 2018, Intralot signed a contract with the New Hampshire Lottery to provide a new sports betting platform.\nIntralot recently announced its H1 2023 financial results, which were mixed. The company’s revenue has fallen, continuing the trend from 2022, however, its EBITDA has risen YoY. The results showed a 14.4% dip in revenue, standing at €175.3 million ($190 million), down from €204.8 million ($222 million) in H1 2022. Despite the revenue decrease, the company recorded NIATMI (Net Income After Tax and Minority Interest) of €4.4 million compared to €-0.5 million from last year. Gross Gaming Revenue (GGR) stood at €163.6 million down 2.9% from €168.5 million in H1 2022. The decline in revenue was largely caused by Intralot discontinuing its Malta business, which impacted the performance of its Licensed Operations B2C unit. The company’s revenue fall was also due to a 75% decrease in B2C activities from its licensed operators and major falls in its Bulgaria and Turkey revenue. Despite the revenue decrease, the company maintained its EBITDA growth and healthy cash flows. As a result, it reported a continuing EBITDA growth of 14.0% to €62.8 million in H1 2023 as compared to €55.1 million in H1 2022.\nSokratis P. Kokkalis, the chairman and CEO of Intralot, was happy with the financial results. He believed that the rise in EBITDA would help the company with its global expansion plans.\n“Intralot’s results for the first half of 2023 show continuing EBITDA growth of 14.0% and healthy cash flows as the company consistently focuses on higher profit margin activities and lower leverage ratios. These developments allow us greater confidence in refinancing our upcoming maturities with an improved credit profile and address significant opportunities in the US and around the globe.”\nHow Q1 and Q2 this year have compared to 2022\nIntralot’s revenue for Q1 2023 was €187.4 million, which was a 3.8% increase compared to the same period in 2022. The EBITDA for Q1 2023 was €25.6 million, which increased by 2.9% compared to the same period last year\n. The company posted a net profit of €3.1 million for the first quarter of 2023, which also rose 3.3% from the previous year. Similarly, the results for the second quarter were also positive, with the revenue increasing by 6.6% to €205.4 million, the EBITDA went up by 6.2% to €28.3 million, and the net profit was up 5% at €4.2 million as compared to the same period in 2022.\nIntralot credited the jump in quarterly EBITDA to “substantial growth” in its US operations, where revenue and EBITDA jumped 13.1% and 31.6% respectively year-over-year. A boosted performance was also seen in Turkey, further contributing to the overall EBITDA growth. Last year, the company had posted stable results for their Q1, as a part of recovery from the pandemic. Intralot’s turnover for Q1 2022 was €97.7 million. According to the company, the largest contributor to its growth last year was the lottery market in Argentina. It contributed 32.4% to the company’s revenue. Intralot saw a decrease in its earnings from operations in Malta last year, which prompted the company to cease operations in that region in 2023. Though the decision has resulted in a decline in revenue so far in 2023, the company hopes to focus more on profitable markets in the near future.\nIntralot extends contract in the US\nIntralot SA’s presence in the US market contributed to its growth in the first six months of 2023. The company has been targeting sustainable growth in the US and key markets around the world. This has enabled the iGaming provider to build a strong presence in the US market, which has contributed to its overall growth. Despite the group revenue being down in H1 2023, the US operations revenue was up by 13%. The company has taken its association with the US one step further by announcing the contract extension of its subsidiary INTRALOT, Inc. with the Wyoming Lottery Corporation for an additional five-year term.\nThe contract extension will help Intralot boost its revenues and empower communities in Wyoming. The deal is a significant win for Intralot, as it allows the company to continue its successful partnership with the Wyoming Lottery Corporation until 2034. Intalot Inc. has been working with WyoLotto since its launch in 2014. Last year, the two entities signed an agreement to extend their partnership until 2029. However, given the boost the US market has provided to the Intralot group’s growth, the company has immediately extended its association for an additional five years to 2034.\nHave you enjoyed this article?

{"id": "8200", "text": "The Game of Life\nThe Game of Life allows up to six players to gather 'round the ol' monitor to take turns spinning the wheel, or rather clicking the pointer that spins the wheel. (Could you really gather six people around a computer?) At most I could imagine two, maybe three, seated around a computer playing this game. The ability to allow multiple players seems better suited to allowing one person to play multiple characters, say one person playing as two against one or two computer opponents. Any more than two computer players and the game is drawn out to a greater length than is humanly possible to sit through. For solo play, I found that playing two characters to one computer character made for the most interesting play. That way you get to play more often than the computer, and you get to watch the computer have its fun without having to endure too much non-interactive tedium.\nThe actual gameplay is fairly lighthearted. In fact it's practically nonexistent, but then I wasn't expecting Starcraft-like strategizing as I began the game. Along the lines of other board game adaptations involving movement along a set path, this one involves nothing more complicated than clicking a picture that simulates the spinning of the famous plastic dial. But obviously I wasn't expecting to be spinning the actual thing; what I expected was a colorfully animated facsimile, and that's what the game delivers. Other gameplay elements have been left intact. Once the dial's spun, a player moves along the track the specified number of spaces and plays out the scenario listed. These include things like \"Produce rock video, Pay $100,000\" and \"Find buried treasure, Collect $80,000\" and come with cartoons and voice-overs that bring them to... life. Some spaces involve playing little minigames (the most complicated that the gameplay ever gets here) like picking squares to match prize dollar amounts. The game board itself looks good and is actually a treat to pan over to check out all of the little scenes.\nIn the beginning, you either choose the route to a career or to school. Along the game path of either choice you eventually hit the space to get married, without so much as the choice of your partner's gender (that could've been a cute '90s gesture and would've given a fresh twist on all the baby-rearing that goes on in this game.) Along the game path the music that plays in the background changes era every sixth of the way, going from the '50s all the way through to the 2000s (which sound suspiciously like the '90s).\nLife's end consists of the players hanging up their boots and retiring. When a player retires they select their neighborhood and then spin in effort to receive bonus money. Their are two options of retirement communities, Countryside Acres and Millionaire Estates. Countryside acres has less opportunity to lose money with retirement, but the most the can expect to be awarded is $45,000. Millionaire estates has many more chances to lose money. Players who retire here could either lose up to $150,000 or win up to $200,000. Once all the players are retired, each player's Life tiles are revealed and the money associated with each tile is given to its respective player. The player with the most money after it all is the winner.", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

{"id": "8231", "text": "12 Questions with nipponNuggets\nThis week, I reached out to the team behind Japan innovation-focused Substack nipponNuggets. To clarify, this is not a promotion. The idea behind these interviews is to pick other people’s brains about areas I personally don’t have much experience in.\nToday’s topic is Japanese tech and innovation.\n1. Could you tell us about yourself - your background, life in Japan, and what you’re focusing on right now?\nMark and Rodney (or the nipponNuggets) are Japanese stock market veterans. We have both been in and around Tokyo and the Japanese equity market for going on 20 years. That journey has taken us through some highs and lows, but it has been a fun journey.\nWe set up Japan Company Visit Partners in 2020 to help foreign fund managers stay connected with Japan and help to engage with Japanese management.\nWe have a passion for high growth, small-cap companies that we believe will benefit from disruptive innovation over the next decade or so. Japan is an under-researched market, where our stock-picking skills can really add value.\n2. How would you characterize the startup scene in Japan? What are the major success cases so far?\nJust starting up... small and behind by Silicon Valley standards but growing fast. From robotics to med-tech to SaaS business models, the start-up scene in Japan has become more vibrant in recent years. The Nikkei Asian Review reported that venture capital funding had increased to over $3bn, up over 50% YoY. Many companies such CyberAgent and SBI Securities have VC division that invests in burgeoning start-ups, mainly centered in Tokyo. Rather than a competition for capital, one of our recent company visits suggests that it’s a competition for projects that is the challenge.\n3. What do you think has been holding back Japanese innovation? Do you see a shift taking place?\nIn 2020, Japan stood as the world’s third-largest economy, underpinned by a top education system, leadership in sectors such as industrial and automotive manufacturing, high-quality infrastructure, as well as a professional culture that produces high-quality goods and services. However, Japan’s low levels of innovation and digital competitiveness are in stark contrast to the country’s economic strength. The country has produced just 5 out of more than 500 unicorn startups globally. Japan is falling short of its full potential.\nStanding in the way of digitization is a risk-averse mindset; senior leaders focused on company longevity rather than productivity; limited exposure of some industries to global competitors; and most importantly, a deficit of more than half a million software-related engineers to build the software applications that will take the country forward.\nThere are success stories of course. Japan has pockets of strength in robotics, AI, biotechnology, gaming etc… Japan performs well in core research and ranks third in the world in terms of global patent filings. We have compiled a list of around 100 smaller companies in Japan, that are at the forefront of some of these trends. You can follow the names here.\n4. What are the key trends in Japanese innovation that you think we should be aware of (digitalisation, EVs, etc)?\nThere are several important trends that we are following now. The most economically viable area right now is the digital transformation of the Japanese office environment. Companies that can offer cloud-based software are huge beneficiaries of a more fragmented, mobile and demanding workforce. In many cases, Japan is up to a decade behind the US in rolling out digital solutions for front and back-office applications. The Coronavirus pandemic has certainly helped to push companies to speed up the adoption of cloud-based solutions.\nLooking further forward, we are seeing a lot of companies that are doing exciting work in the fields of AI, machine learning, computer vision and language processing. These are often surprisingly small companies with a handful of staff and limited revenues. But the technologies and potential applications just look really exciting.\nE-commerce and digital marketing are already large markets that are growing rapidly. There are still multiple old businesses in Japan that will be disrupted over the next few years if they cannot transition quickly enough, whether that be in fast fashion, second-hand stores, auctions, payments, or delivery.\n5. Which listed companies do you think are doing something truly innovative right now - something new and different?\nFor companies that are doing something really innovative, I would suggest looking into some of the AI players. Neural Pocket (4056) is using AI technologies to run Smart Cities. The company specializes in Image and Video recognition, while the key tech edge is the ability to process the data at the “edge” rather than in the cloud. This leads to much lower computing costs, lower latency and better privacy.\nKudan (4425) is involved in Artificial Perception, which is used in a broad barrage of industries from autonomous driving, robotics and mapping. The core SLAM technology is in effect, the “eyes” of the machine.\n6. Are there any examples of “old school” Japanese companies that you think will be able to successfully reinvent themselves?\nI think that there are quite a few examples of Japanese companies that are reinventing themselves. To be fair, some of it has been forced on the company, whether by responding to scandals or attracting the interest of activist investors. Other companies have simply had to change as the old business models became unprofitable and disappeared.\nHitachi is one example of a company that has been reinventing itself over the past several years. With more of a focus on capital returns, the company has taken the unusual step of disposing non-core assets and reinvesting cash flows into higher return business segments.\nNidec is another good example. With really fantastic management, the company has continually moved into new markets, all built on the strength of its small motor technology. It used to dominate the market for HDD motors, but as that market shrinks, Nidec has turned to supply motors and e-axels to automakers.\n7. Curious to hear your take on Japanese auto makers’ approach to electric mobility (BEV / FCEV). Who do you think is best positioned?\nEasy answer. Toyota is best positioned. The market is obviously excited by Tesla. But we see Toyota as the best and most innovative auto company in the world. Toyota has not come out with a bang in electric mobility like GM and VW. However, they have the technology and will soon roll out some cool products.\nIt is no easy feat to balance the shift to EVs when you produce over 10mn cars per year which are still highly profitable and selling in high numbers. However, they do have a full suite of products and models to meet the carbon challenge. They have strategically tied up with other Japanese auto and truck makers as they roll out their zero-carbon technology.\n8. A large part of the Japanese business world is still reliant on paper documents. Several new companies are pushing towards greater digitalization. Which of these companies do you like the best and why?\nLoL – the infamous Japanese fax machine! They just will not go away.\nNevertheless, Covid-19 has been a wake-up call for companies. Spending on digitalization has surged as firms raced to enable staff to work from home and keep doing business. The establishment of a Digital Ministry to revamp government services has sent a strong signal to business leaders. Digitization and AI initiatives are not just nice to have, they are imperative if Japan is to lift productivity and regain its status as a center of innovation\nAs I alluded to above, there are a number of companies that are benefitting from the digital transformation of the office. The likes of Money Forward and Freee (accounting software), Rakus (expense management), and Bengo4 (digital signatures) all have good quality business models, large addressable markets and decent management teams.\n9. How would you characterize the Japanese e-commerce market and the way it’s developing?\nOpportunity is the keyword to describe the Japanese e-commerce market. For context, traditional retail in Japan is about $1.3trn annual turnover market size. From that, e-commerce still represents a mere $140bn, or just over 10% of retail. The e-commerce shift is just getting its 2nd wind as COVID-19 has added new impetus to the online shift. Competitive forces have taken hold with companies in the massive retail sector, realizing that business without an online strategy poses this shrinkage in the best case and bankruptcy in the worst.\n10. How do you take into account corporate governance when you analyse Japanese stocks?\nCorporate governance is particularly important in Japan. We believe that good governance is essential for long-term value creation. We try to identify companies that are capable of delivering outstanding long-term returns. This is best achieved by a management team that can run the business for the long term while considering the needs of society and other stakeholders.\nFor many of the smaller companies that we follow, the long-term value creation thinking often comes from the founder of the company. We want to see them generate significant value over the long term, rather than become preoccupied with hitting quarterly earnings estimates.\nThe composition of the board is also vitally important. For many of these companies, the biggest challenge is scaling the businesses. The transition from a small company to a large company is seldom easy, but a cognitively diverse board can certainly help - combining skills and experience that the internal management team does not have. Finally, we want to ensure that the remuneration policies are simple and reward for superior long-term performance.\n11. Would love to hear your take on valuation multiples among innovation-focused Japanese companies? Where do you find value?\nWe take a different view of the valuations of these innovation-focused companies. Traditional metrics are useless for companies growing sales at 30-100%, many of which are yet to become profitable.\nWe are more focused on answering the questions such as:\nWhat is the size of the market?\nDoes the company have a moat, and is it sustainable?\nDoes the company’s management have the vision and strategy to execute?\nAre they incentivized to generate the kind of free cash flow in the long term that will lead to 5x or more expansion in enterprise value?\nWe put this assessment in our 4M framework, explicitly looking at Model, Market, Moat, and Management. When we visit companies, our questions are all geared at answering these questions.\n12. Where can people learn more about you and nipponNuggets?\nYou can follow the nipponNuggets at jcvpartners.substack.com.\nSimply put, it is a bite-sized look at Japanese companies that benefit from Disruptive Innovation.

{"id": "8243", "text": "Here's how to watch the Pokémon Presents live stream in the UK today - and what could be revealed\nA surprise announced live-stream looks set to give Pokemon fans an update on what to expect from the upcoming downloadable content (DLC) for the Sword and Shield games.\nIt’s not entirely certain what might be shown off as part of Pokémon Presents (the YouTube video’s description simply reads, “We have Pokémon news, you want Pokémon news”).\nBut since the presentation is occurring on the release date of Pokémon Sword and Shield’s ‘Isle of Armor’ Expansion Pass, we can realistically expect a more in-depth look at the DLC.\nHere's everything you need to know:\nWhat will Pokémon Presents entail?\nAt this point, we know quite a bit about that first expansion (assuming there’s not a wealth of information being held back for today’s live stream) – so could we see more details outlined on the next Expansion Pass, The Crown Tundra?\nThe Crown Tundra will transport players to a snow-swept realm in which people live in small communities where they support and rely on one another across a shining, silvery landscape.\nIt won’t be available until later in the year – November 2020 is its planned release date.\nWhat else might be shown off as part of Pokémon Presents?\nOf course, it’s just speculation that the presentation will be used to provide fans with more details on Sword and Shield’s upcoming Expansion Passes.\nPokémon Presents could be used to announce news on literally any aspect of the Pokémon franchise.\nCould we see an update on Pokémon GO? Other than changes made to allow people to play the game indoors during the coronavirus crisis, there hasn't been a significant update in a long time.\nThere could also be news of spin-off games for console and mobile, as well as new Pokémon toys.\nAgain, this is all pure conjecture; all of our questions will be answered by the live stream.\nHow can I watch Pokémon Presents in the UK?\nPokémon Presents will begin at 2pm BST on Wednesday 17 June.\nYou can watch the official stream on the Pokémon YouTube channel.\nThough there is no confirmed ‘release time’ for the Isle of Armor expansion, it could be made available following the conclusion of the 11-minute stream.\nWhat is the Isle of Armor?\nIsle of Armor is the first of two new Expansion Passes that will unlock new areas, features, items and moves that weren't previously available in Pokémon Sword and Shield.\nThe expansions are not new games, rather they are additions to your existing copy of Pokémon Sword or Shield, and will introduce players to brand new areas of the games’ Britain-inspired Galar region, as well as new features, items and moves that weren’t previously available.\nThe first expansion takes you to the titular location, which Nintendo describes as a \"giant island full of environments not seen in Galar before,\" where you'll find wave-swept beaches, forests, bogs, caves, and sand dunes.\nPokémon developers Game Freak will also be debuting some brand new Pokémon with the Sword and Shield expansions; Kubfu and its evolved form Urshifu will appear exclusively in the Isle of Armor, while Calyrex will only appear in The Crown Tundra.\nWill the expansions include new Pokémon?\nIn the run-up to Pokémon Sword and Shield’s release, there was loud outcry from fans who claimed developers Game Freak were being ‘lazy’ by not including a full roster of collectable creatures.\nBefore the game’s release, the Pokémon series featured over 800 monsters to capture, but the latest game only included 400.\nThat’s likely due to the sheer amount of work it takes in animating hundreds and hundreds of characters for a game of Pokémon’s scope, but whatever the reason, Game Freak are making ‘amends’ by adding over 200 Pokémon to Sword and Shield.\nSome of the returning creatures will be version specific, meaning that each Expansion Pass will feature Pokémon only available to that edition – unless you trade with another player.\nAlongside the 200 returning favourites, Game Freak will also be debuting some brand new Pokémon with the Sword and Shield expansions.\nHow much do the Passes cost, and when can I play them?\nBoth expansions are bundled together for £26.99, but you’ll want to be careful when making your purchase on the Nintendo eShop.\nYou’ll need to buy the bundle that corresponds to the game you already own, so double check you have the right one before you confirm your transaction.\nThe first expansion – The Isle of Armour – will be available to explore from 17 June.\nThe Crown Tundra won’t be unlocked until later in the year: November is its planned release date.", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

{"id": "8260", "text": "Can you tell us a little bit about your activities?\nLewis Latimer was an African American inventor who helped perfect the electric lightbulb and spent time in London developing electric street lighting. We wanted to promote awareness of Latimer and to highlight Brixton and South London in the history of the electric lightbulb, including the history behind the naming of the infamous Electric Avenue (one of the first streets in Britain to be lit by electric lights). We produced an exhibition at the Black Cultural Archives (BCA) that walked visitors through Latimer’s early life to his time spent in London and work with Thomas Edison, and that also displayed archival research on local reactions to Latimer’s improvements to electric lighting. We also hosted a performance and workshop for families. An actor playing Latimer told audiences about his life and works, engaging them with the science behind the lightbulb, before leading them in experiments where they made a ‘home-made’ lightbulb. Following the performance and science experiments there was a poetry masterclass with RagzCV from local charity Poetic Unity.\nYou held a variety of different activities for Being Human 2022. How did you bring them all together to create a coherent series of activities?\nThe exhibition displayed the underlying research that informed the performance. The two worked together, with one offering further contextual details and archival material, and the other offering a more directly engaging experience for visitors to the BCA. The workshop was a family-friendly event that attracted audience members from ages 5-75. Having ‘Latimer’ there in person to guide participants through the history we were trying to tell, really brought the archival research to life. The activity, performance and workshop elements were repeated on both Saturdays during the festival, with the exhibition also running throughout the week in-between.\nHow did you go about establishing and fostering a strong partnership between your two organisations (University of Surrey and the BCA)?\nI became involved with the BCA Youth Forum after attending a workshop series on Black British History in February 2022. I was working on my PhD thesis at the time and had recently moved to South London. From September 2022, the BCA were running a Black Futures season, which included an exhibition on ‘Transforming Legacies’. Seeing the Being Human Festival’s theme of ‘Breakthroughs’, I thought this was an excellent opportunity to collaborate on the connecting themes. Dr Ayshah Johnston (Learning and Engagement Manager at the BCA), the Youth Forum and I worked together to propose Lewis Latimer as a case study for both a breakthrough and a legacy that directly impacted the BCA’s local community. Ayshah was so generous in her guidance as I gathered archival material for the exhibition, and she supported the entire programme and delivery. Members of the youth forum also volunteered to help run the workshops on the day. This was an event that we all wanted to succeed and we had a great time working together to put it on.\nWhat do you feel both organisations brought to the partnership?\nThe BCA not only hosted the event, but also mentored me as I stepped away from my PhD research to research a topic not usually within my expertise. Ayshah, as Learning and Engagement Manager, also had the expertise to design and host public engagement activities. I was able to fit research for the exhibition and performance alongside my doctoral work, and so gathered the archival material necessary, and drafted the copy for the exhibition banners. I was able to enjoy an experience of research and public engagement in a setting removed from my University, while I offered my labour to the BCA who now have exhibition banners that will be used in future for their Black Victorians workshop.\nHow did you make sure you engaged your target audience?\nOur activities were aimed at families and young people aged 4-16 in the local area of Brixton, South London. The BCA has a strong presence in Brixton, and so posters advertising the event locally drew the attention of passers-by who trusted the reputation of BCA as an organisation that hosts exciting and high-quality events relevant to said community. Their mailing list was also an invaluable asset, promoting the event to those already engaged with the BCA. In addition to this we worked with Poetic Unity on this event, a charity that has strong ties to the BCA. Their social media presence then further engaged an audience interested in creative responses to Black local history. Some audience members stumbled upon the event on Eventbrite as well, and travelled from across London to participate.\nDo you have any top tips or lessons learned for future event organisers?\nHave regular meetings with your partners to keep each other up-to-date on what’s going on.\nDiscuss who your audience is and how you want to engage them from the start.\nHave a practice run to make sure any experiments/activities go according to plan – and what you would do if they didn’t!\n‘A Lightbulb Idea: Lewis Latimer’s Scientific Breakthroughs’ took place as part of Being Human Festival 2022 and was funded by a Being Human Small Award. It was led by Dr Alicia Barnes (formerly of the University of Surrey) and Dr Ayshah Johnston (Black Cultural Archives).", "scores": {"score": 3, "score_transform_1": 5, "score_transform_2": 5, "score_transform_3": 0}}
{"id": "8291", "text": "Contemporary Arts Performer\nBrandy Butler is originally from Reading, Pennslyvania. Born to a multi-racial household, Brandy was immediately immersed into a world full of cultural intersections. Brandy's mother was an avid musical fan and invested many years teaching her the essential Rodgers and Hammerstein catalog(among others). Brandy's father filled the house with the Sound of Philadelphia, Miles Davis and Motown. By the time Brandy was in the 4th grade they had already developed a strong love of music and began to play the flute.\nIn 1997 Brandy moved to Philadelphia to pursue their love of Jazz Music at the University of the Arts. It was in Philadelphia that Brandy found home: a city dedicated to it's love of music and, of course, sports teams (Go Eagles!). Philadelphia became their permanent residence. Brandy graduated in 2001 with a Bachelor's in Jazz Performance: Jazz Flute, Minor Jazz Tuba. They spent the following years teaching Elementary Music in the Philadelphia School District.\nDuring this time Brandy became the lead singer of Philadephia local favorite band, Saigon Slimm.\nIn 2003, on a whim, Brandy decided to take a break from music and life in Philadelphia by moving to Switzerland and working as an au-pair for a family outside of Zürich. Within months after arriving, Brandy began to work as a singer and musician in the local Zürich scene.\nOver the last 20 years, Brandy has made appearances with almost every major Swiss Artist including Sophie Hunger, Erika Stucky, Sina, Stress, Steff La Cheffe, Phenomden and Philip Funkhauser, to name just a few.

{"id": "8303", "text": "Which type of safety advisor are you?\nToday’s business environment demands agility from safety professionals to be successful. It’s agility that allows for the proper and effective response to change and turns adversities into opportunities.\nHistorically, the role of the safety advisor was to “police” the workplace and drive compliance to the legislation and the company policy. Gone are the days where the “safety cop” is the safety professional’s main role in our modern workplaces. In fact, safety advisors that bring just this antiquated thinking and approach often find themselves disconnected and disempowered by the exact system they are supposed to be serving. The role must evolve beyond simple compliance.\nToday, the business unit management team owns compliance and the role of the safety advisor has broadened to include being a consultant, consensus-builder, advocate, tutor, coach and mentor. There is a wide range of competencies and skills needed by a safety advisor to succeed in today’s workplace, and it is fair to say the role of the safety advisor is growing. The skills needed for success today include hard skills such as knowledge of engineering, physics, math and chemistry. The skill set for success also includes soft skills such as communication, leadership, general business acumen and a technical understanding of your company’s core business. Important behaviors include customer service, problem-solving, needs analysis and risk communication.\nSafety advisers use their knowledge and skills to promote a positive culture and best practices in health, safety and environmental management in the workplace. Their job is to support the operations team that is responsible for ensuring the employer and all employees comply with safety legislation and that the management system (policies and practices) established to provide the framework for compliance are adopted and adhered to. They need to bring a transformational leadership style to work with them every day and be able to adjust to this style and, indeed, their communication style to every circumstance.\nThe question is, how should safety advisors position themselves to maximize their impact and therefore maximize their value to the company? We know that simply driving compliance will not do. We also know that the role of the safety advisor has broadened significantly. The range of approaches a safety professional can take in his advisory work can be characterized as one of the policemen, the politician, the technician, the challenger and the consensus-builder. Depending on the circumstance, each of these approaches may be more effective than others.\nThe policeman is the deeply self-confident safety advisor, often from the “old school” or with too many years of working experience in a single industry. They follow instinct that the years on the job have taught them. They know the letter of the legislation and they may be described as the “enforcer” who does things “by the book,” believing safety is a discipline distinct from operational excellence.\nThe politician has a bias towards telling people what they want to hear. They are usually good communicators, liked by most and are considered to be highly reliable. Their focus is on the people aspects of safety and listening to employees’ concerns. They may struggle with the bigger issues and prefer to talk about issues rather than take corrective action.\nThe technician is exactly as the title sounds: they know the science of safety and speak to the technical correctness of how thing should be done. They are hardworking, often putting their “nose to the grindstone.” They are typically well-educated, self-motivated and don’t give up easily. They are the safety advisor that will fight long and hard for what they think is technically correct.\nThe challenger may best be described as the debater in the safety department. They have a deep and thorough understanding of the technical aspects of the company’s business and the safety system and they are not afraid to challenge the business unit leaders and teach them something new about how things could be run. They are not afraid of controversy and can often be quite assertive (although diplomatic) about pushing new ways of thinking about old problems.\nThe consensus-builder thrives on nurturing and fostering relationships and is an advocate for safety at every level of the organization. They “speak many languages” and can relate equally well with the front-line labourers as with the senior management team. They willingly give their time to those that ask for it. Their primary posture to the employee group they serve is “accessibility” and “first-class” service. Consensus-builders may be seen as the master communicators in the organization.\nWhile many safety advisors have the capacity to modify their approach, most default to a single one. There is not one best role for the safety advisor to take. The variety of circumstances a safety advisor may face would call for a variety of roles. It is recognized the role may need to be adjusted for any given situation and appropriate adaptation may garner the greatest success. It can be generalized that the consensus-builder and challenger profiles may be best suited to the direction that the safety profession is evolving, however, as the world becomes increasingly technical, some support from the technician may be highly beneficial. There may be times during some types of risk communication where the politician may be best but, increasingly, it is becoming evident that the role of the policeman needs to be limited to crisis-type situations when a command-and-control leadership style may be needed.\nIdeally, the safety professional is multi-skilled and highly adaptive with the capacity to modify her thinking and behavioral preferences to suit any circumstances. Situational leadership is very much the order of the day. When the safety team is knowledgeable about safety, regularly talks about safety with the operations team and engages in matters related to safety to build consensus, they increase the likelihood that safety will indeed succeed. The safety professional must take a leadership role in supporting the operations team to own and drive the safety activities such that safety becomes a habit. In the absence of this tutoring, coaching and mentoring role, safety becomes a “nice to have.” Occupational health and safety risk management only works when it becomes a habit. We need to make safety a habit.\nThis article originally appeared in the August/September 2017 issue of COS", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

{"id": "8320", "text": "Grocery shopping or getting a drink on a terrace\ngepubliceerd op: 15 May 2020\nMaintaining a monthly blog in a period when the impulses from outside have disappeared does not seem to be easy at first. After all, we don't really experience much outside of our gate to write about. Provided you can count a weekly trip to the local supermarket. Let's not get into the details about that too much. Or is it?\nA visit to the local super was just like any outing a pleasant activity for us. Armed together with our shopping bags to the village. Usually before a \"garoto\" at the bar in the supermarket, or on the terrace at our friends at New Era. Usually the latter is a less good option if we have more on the agenda that day. It has happened several times that this \"cup of coffee\" turned into a complete afternoon program with friends and acquaintances who also passed by and queuing. On such a day it is wonderful and you feel the freedom splashing off. When the afternoon is over and lunch gives way to toasts with wine, we just must not forget to get the groceries.\nAt the moment, grocery shopping looks slightly different. The coffee bar is closed anyway, there is usually a queue of around 6-8 people in front of us and we put on our gloves neatly. Some people wear mouth masks and all are properly spaced. The supermarket manager welcomes everyone personally and takes another trolley into the store in turn. But not before the hands are disinfected and also the handle of the shopping cart. In Madeira it is all very orderly and neat. We notice that everyone adheres well to the \"Covid-19 rules\". This certainly contributes to the fact that there are still so few infections here.\nOnce in the store, we see that everything is just there. Something not always the case on this island, but it is remarkably well supplied. And that for more than 6 weeks now since Madeira was closed to the outside world. Apparently they are working extra hard to be able to offer everything. Despite the stricter work regulations, the store employees are also very friendly and helpful as always. For us, only the shopping list changes a little bit, we cook more at home and experiment more in our house. A wide range of recipes has already been added to the list of \"guestproof recipes\" for later. So much fun to do. The most delicious soups, banana carrot cake, fresh focaccia, apple crumble muffins and various oriental dishes. When we leave the till and drive home it is nice to be there again. It is a strange world with all those mouth caps and therefore (even) less intelligible words.\nOnce home, we usually fall into the routine of the day. It will be no different for many than it is for us. So it doesn't really matter where you stay in this world. That is also unique, right? What makes it special here is the view of the ocean and the door that is almost always open. We are also working on ideas that can be implemented when we can receive guests again. Things that make it even more fun and delicious to be here with us and things that make it easier for the guest. Think of activities that we enrich with our knowledge or additions of services such as BBQ on site in the mountains, or the provision of delicious filled picnic backpacks. So that we can give you the holiday feeling you deserve even more.\nOur own reusable water bottles have now also arrived. These will be for sale later when you are here for a price that is more than 40% below the retail price, we pay the rest so that you really get something beautiful.

It uses hydrogen to generate electricity – onboard – which is used to drive the car’s electric motors. Which means, with a proper hydrogen refuelling infrastructure in place, that we can continue to get fuel for our cars as and when we need it. No need to search out a re-charging station for a ‘quick’ 3.5 hour charge when we run out, or plug the car in to the mains at home overnight for enough charge to get to work the next day.\nAnd who is sticking his neck out and championing this, the most promising of new fuel technologies? Why, none other than the Governator himself, Arnold Schwarzenegger, who has even had one of his favourite Hummers converted to run on hydrogen, and is pushing ahead with plans to have a full hydrogen re-fuelling infrastructure at petrol (or should I say, gas) stations throughout California. Which makes Arnie, who has been decried in the past for being an Austrian ‘Nazi’, probably the most important champion of this ‘Planet Saving’ technology. The left-wing eco-loonies won’t like that.\nBut despite this hugely promising solution, the eco-mentalists are nay-saying even this. According to Tony Bosworth of Friends of the Earth:\n“Hydrogen is only as green as the electrical energy used to separate it.\n“If the electricity comes from fossil fuels such as coal or gas, these cars will still be contributing to climate change.\n“If the hydrogen is made with wind or solar power, it would be genuinely green but widespread commercialisation of hydrogen technology is years away and we need transport solutions now.”\nI don’t remember FoE actually decrying plug-in EVs for the same reason, despite the obvious self-same argument about electricity generation. And, as with oil, the hydrogen extraction can take place where it is most practical to do so and not be a drain on the National Grid. Still, FoE and the like have never seemed to have much cohesion in their arguments.\nThe Honda FCX Clarity is being leased for around £400 per month in SoCal. It manages 0-60 in around 10 seconds and does the equivalent of 75mpg.\nI’d have one for day-to-day.

The effects of dehydration may even cause damage to your body before you realize the need to hydrate yourself. Our elderly loved ones are at a greater risk of dehydration compared to their younger counterparts.\nWe are also at risk of being dehydrated on hot days or after engaging in vigorous exercises. Mild or moderate cases of dehydration are easy to recover from. However, in severe cases of dehydration, one has to seek medical attention immediately. We need to remind our family members to drink more water. If your elderly loved ones do not like to drink water, fret not! Let us share with you how you can encourage them to drink more water.\nConsume Fruits and Vegetables with High Water Content\nIf your loved ones do not like to drink water, you can get them to consume foods that have high water content. Try to offer them fruits as snacks throughout the day. The top vegetables and fruits that have high water content are:\n- Bell Peppers\nDo note that the US Food & Drug Administration advises against mixing medications and grapefruit. Grapefruits can block the enzymes required to break down the drug. If the drug is not broken down properly, this could potentially lead to an increase in the amount of medication in the patient’s system, which may lead to harmful side effects. Therefore, remind your loved ones not to consume grapefruit when it’s almost time to take their medication.\nDrink Soup as an Alternative to Water\nAn excellent alternative to water that can keep your loved ones hydrated is soup. Not only does soup provide nutrients for their bodily functions, but it can also be made to taste good. However, your loved ones should avoid consuming canned or pre-packaged soups as these are usually loaded with high levels of sodium.\nSodium can cause dehydration and should be avoided if your loved ones have high blood pressure. Intake of sodium can lead to an increased risk of heart attacks, congestive heart failures, kidney damage and strokes. If you intend to offer soup to your loved ones to help them increase their fluid intake, do consider preparing the soup yourself so you can control the amount of salt that is added to it. If preparing soup from scratch is not an option, you should always choose low-sodium broth and soup options.\nPrepare Fruit-Based Ice Pops\nDuring hotter seasons such as summer, there is an increased risk of dehydration in the elderly population. You can help your loved ones beat the heat and stay hydrated in fun and delicious ways, such as preparing smoothie ice pops, sorbet or slushies.\nOne quick, easy recipe for fruit-based ice pops is to fill about half of the ice pop cup with your loved one’s favorite fruit juice. Leave the cup in the freezer until the juice is partially frozen. Then insert an ice pop stick into the cup. Continue freezing the ice pop until it becomes frozen and is ready to be eaten!\nSenior Living Programs at Discovery Village At Alliance Town Center\nWe need to remind our loved ones to increase their fluid intake and consume a more balanced diet to stay healthy.

{"id": "8427", "text": "The eastern quoll (Dasyurus viverrinus), formerly known as the eastern native cat is a medium-sized carnivorous marsupial found only in Australia. It is one of six extant species of quolls.\nThe size of a small domestic cat, it’s no wonder the eastern quoll is a favourite marsupial of those lucky enough to see one. Nocturnal by nature, this solitary but bold carnivore usually hunts in open country or woodland. It can occasionally be spotted foraging by day but prefers to spend daylight hours in nests made under rocks in underground burrows or fallen logs.\nEastern quolls are generally about the size of a small domestic cat. Females are significantly smaller, measuring 48 to 58 cm (19 to 23 in), and weighing around 0.7 kg (1.5 lb). The eastern quoll has a pointed nose, and a bushy tail. They have a thick coat covered by white spots, that can be either light fawn or near black, with off-white underparts stretching from the chin to the underside of the tail. Eastern quolls can be distinguished from all other species of quoll by the presence of only four toes (rather than five) on the hind feet, lacking the hallux (1).\nThe species is currently classified as Endangered by the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species (2). It is functionally extinct on mainland Australia due to disease and predation by introduced predators (red fox and feral cat), but remains widespread in Tasmania, and is also found today on Bruny Island. The lack of foxes in Tasmania likely has contributed to the survival of the species there; however, unseasonal weather events and predation by feral cats are thought to be contributing to a possible recent decline in the Tasmanian population.\nToday, we share the chromosome-length genome assembly for the eastern quoll. As far as we know, this is the first whole-genome resource for the species. This is a $1K genome assembly, with contig N50 of 42kb and scaffold N50 of 531Mb. See our Methods page for more detail on the procedure. The interactive contact map of the eastern quoll’s chromosomes is included below.\nWe gratefully acknowledge the tissue samples provided by the Ranger Red’s Zoo & Conservation Park and the collaboration with Natasha Tay, Harry Butler Institute, Murdoch University towards tissue preparations. The Hi-C work was enabled by resources provided by DNA Zoo Australia, The University of Western Australia (UWA) and DNA Zoo, Aiden Lab at Baylor College of Medicine (BCM) with additional computational resources and support from the Pawsey Supercomputing Centre.\nWe hope that this assembly will provide the genomics resource towards the Tasmanian Quoll Conservation Program (TQCP), to estimate the genome-wide genetic diversity present in the existing Tasmanian population, ensure mainland populations being released in wild and otherwise help protect this charismatic marsupial cat.\n1.

{"id": "8443", "text": "Building on prior guidance issued in 2020, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) recently warned in a new blog post that it will use its authority under existing laws to take enforcement action against companies that sell or use algorithms or artificial intelligence (AI) technology that results in discrimination by race or other legally protected classes.\nThe agency urged companies developing or using AI to ensure their AI tools or applications do not result in biased outcomes because a failure to do so may result in \"deception, discrimination—and an FTC  enforcement action.\" The agency's latest pronouncement leaves no doubt that the FTC will be actively reviewing the market for potential bias or discrimination when AI-enabled applications and services are used to provide access to housing, credit, finance, insurance, or other important services.\nAs our readers know, AI is emerging as a transformative technology that is enabling new systems, tools, applications, and use cases. At the same time, perceived risks arising from potential bias, discrimination, or other negative outcomes is leading regulators to look more closely at both the benefits and potential risks of the technology. To that end, the FTC is moving quickly to assert itself as a leading regulator with authority to oversee a broad range of AI providers, systems, and applications on the market.\nBasis of Potential AI-related FTC Enforcement Actions\nThree statutes provide the FTC significant authority to act in this area. Specifically, Section 5 of the FTC Act prohibits unfair or deceptive practices. The FTC's latest statement suggests that the agency believes it can use Section 5 authority, for example, to penalize entities selling or using \"racially biased algorithms.\"\nFurther, the agency also has authority to act under the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), which could be applied when an algorithm is used in a process that results in the denial of employment, housing, credit, insurance, or other benefits. Similarly, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA)—which prohibits a company from using a biased algorithm that results in credit discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, marital status, age, or because a person receives public assistance—could be another basis for the agency to act. Thus, for example, if your algorithm results in credit discrimination against a protected class, you could find yourself facing a complaint alleging violations of the FTC Act and ECOA.\nNotably, the FTC's blog post is framed as both guidance and a reaffirmation that the FTC has been policing issues around AI and big data for many years and sends a clear signal that it intends to do so going forward. This reinforces Acting Chair Rebecca Kelly Slaughter's recent speech on algorithmic discrimination in which she cited a study demonstrating that an algorithm used with good intentions—to target medical interventions to the sickest patients—ended up funneling resources to a healthier, white population, to the detriment of sicker, patients of color. She asked the FTC staff \"to actively investigate biased and discriminatory algorithms\" and expressed an interest \"in further exploring the best ways to address AI-generated consumer harms.\"\nIndeed, as we explained in recent blog posts, recent FTC enforcement actions reflect increased scrutiny of companies using algorithms, automated processes, and/or AI-enabled applications. The FTC's recent settlement with Everalbum is instructive in that it illustrates the agency's latest remedial tool: the so-called \"disgorgement\" of ill-gotten data.\nIn the recent enforcement case, the FTC alleged that Everalbum, an app developer that used photos uploaded by users to train its facial recognition technology, failed to properly obtain users' consent. The agency also alleged that Everalbum made false statements about the users' ability to delete their photos upon deactivating their accounts.\nOn these facts, the FTC secured a settlement and consent decree that required Everalbum to delete algorithms that used the data obtained without consent—a remedy that is akin to the \"fruit of the poisonous tree\" concept—and obtain consent before using facial recognition technology on user content.\nThe FTC's latest reaffirmation of its authority to act in this area demonstrates that the agency will hold businesses accountable for using AI that may result in biased outcomes or for making promises that the technology cannot deliver. Its message is clear: \"Hold yourself accountable – or be ready for the FTC to do it for you.\"\nFTC Best Practices on Using AI \"Truthfully, Fairly, and Equitably\" and Steps to Mitigate Potential Harms\nThe FTC's blog post also articulates key best practices to avoid potential legal jeopardy, which generally fall in to one of the following four categories:\n- 1. Use good data;\n- 2. Test algorithms for discriminatory outcomes;\n- 3. Do not exaggerate capabilities of the technology and be transparent; and\n- 4. Be accountable.\nUse Good Data\nThe FTC explains that \"a solid foundation\" should be the right starting point for AI. That is, companies should conduct due diligence to examine datasets that are used to train AI.\nIf a data set is riddled with errors or is missing information about particular populations to which the AI model applies, discrimination would be inevitable even without any unlawful intent. Therefore, the FTC recommends that companies must think about ways to improve their datasets used to design their AI models to account for data gaps, and—in light of any shortcomings—limit where or how they use the model.\nTest Algorithms for Discriminatory Outcomes\nThe FTC also points out that during PrivacyCon 2020, researchers presented work showing that algorithms developed for benign purposes (such as healthcare resource allocation and advertising) have actually resulted in racial bias. In order to ensure that a well-intentioned algorithm does not result in racial or gender inequity, the FTC states that it is essential to test the algorithm before use and periodically after that.\nDo Not Exaggerate the AI System's Capabilities\nAs evident in the Everalbum case, the FTC warns companies not to overpromise what their algorithms can deliver. Statements companies make to consumers must be \"truthful, non-deceptive, and backed by evidence.\"\nExaggerating or overstating what the algorithm can do may constitute deception, resulting in an FTC enforcement action. Additionally, the FTC recommends that companies should make their data and use of AI transparent, employ independent standards, open the data or source code to outside inspection, and publish the results of independent audits.\nThe agency cites transparency practices as the key to uncovering certain biases in healthcare systems that were discovered by third-party researchers. The FTC urges other providers \"to think about ways to embrace transparency and independence\" through the use of transparency frameworks and independent standards, and by \"conducting and publishing the results of independent audits, and by opening your data or source code to outside inspection.\"\nFinally, the FTC explains that \"unfair\" practices under the FTC Act means a practice that \"causes more harm than good.\" For example, when a company's algorithm targets consumers most interested in buying its products by considering race, color, religion, and sex, the result might be digital redlining that \"causes more harm than good.\" In such cases, the FTC may have a basis to challenge the use of the AI model as unfair.\nBeyond its recommendations on transparency and independence, the FTC makes clear that companies should not limit themselves to the FTC statements and must be proactive in holding themselves accountable for their algorithm's performance. Its message is unambiguous: \"if you don't hold yourself accountable, the FTC may do it for you,\" regardless of whether discrimination is caused by a biased algorithm or simply by human misconduct.\nThe FTC's warning demonstrates that the agency is serious about holding businesses accountable for using biased AI or for making promises that the technology cannot deliver. Companies must keep their practices grounded in established FTC consumer protection principles as the agency is likely to take a stronger stance on harmful, biased, and unfair uses of AI.", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}

{"id": "8468", "text": "As a doula, my main goal is for my clients to look back at their birth as a positive, empowering experience, even if the birth doesn't go as planned. Here are some tools to help accomplish this.\n1. Educate Yourself\nTake a childbirth education class. Whether you prefer in-person, virtual or on-demand learning, there are many different options available to educate yourself on all things childbirth. Read books. Listen to podcasts. There are so many good options available to you, and many at no cost to you.\n2. Know Your Options\nSee above! The best way to learn your options is to be educated. A good childbirth education class will cover providers (OBGYN, midwife, etc.), where you'll deliver your baby (hospital, birth center, home), pain management options, etc. Childbirth educators will give you evidence-based information so you can plan your ideal birth and be prepared for whatever challenges you may face.\n3. Find the Right Provider\nThis is so important. Finding a provider that supports you in your goals for childbirth may be the most crucial aspect of preparing for labor. Interview different providers, tell them your expectations, ask them about their experiences and don't be afraid to bring up any concerns you may have about your care. Remember, it's never too late to switch providers.\n4. Build Your Support Team\nWho do you want in the room with you when you're laboring? Your partner? Your mother? A doula? Decide who will be on your team, talk through different birth scenarios, and figure out how your team can best support you in each of those instances. Know what your ideal birth looks like, but also how you can feel supported if things don't go as planned.\n5. Give Informed Consent\nWhen someone considers their birth to be traumatic it's often because they feel their power was taken from them - that decisions were made on their behalf. They feel like things were done to them without their permission. It's important that you give informed consent before any procedure is done, medication is given or an exam is given. Use your voice!\n6. Give Yourself Grace\nGiving yourself grace is more of a mindset than an action. Choose to be kind to yourself. Celebrate your achievements, as large or small as they may be. Allow yourself to be imperfect. You may have expectations for how your birth will go and find it's not going as expected. Give yourself grace.", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}

{"id": "8472", "text": "Interview of Christine Detrez, sociologist, for International Women’s Day\nChristine Detrez, lecturer at the ENS de Lyon and a specialist in gender, was one very busy woman on March 8, 2016: speaking at a roundtable in Lyon on the theme \"Feminism and Seduction\", and later on RFI radio station for International Women's Day. One year ago, she published Quel genre? (\"What gender?\"), an essay on the cliché phrases we use without thinking and which confine girls and boys to specific roles. Her latest book was released last week: Can women be great men? On March 14, she was at the Grand Palais in Paris for a debate on the theme: \"Neither masculine nor feminine. Are you of the neutral gender?\"\nBelin editions asked you to write a book on gender using a striking tone. It became Can women be great men? with anecdotes, data and quotes that make readers pause…\nChristine Detrez: It's a real writing exercise. I'm an adept of \"gay science,\" as nailed by philosopher Michèle Le Doeuff. In research, you can be very rigorous but not take yourself seriously. Humor is the best way to get a message across. And that works for everybody: friends, family, colleagues, researchers, children and teenagers. Going to secondary schools and high schools to talk about gender, I think, is the continuity of a researcher's mission. I consider it a transfer of knowledge, and it's also one of the missions of the ENS de Lyon: dissemination of knowledge. Did you know for instance that out of 13,192 names of men and women in schoolbooks, only 6.1 percent are women? That J.K. Rowling chose to only use the initial of her first name to hide the fact she was a woman? And you must know about the Matilda effect…\nIn September 2014, the president of the ENS de Lyon appointed you special advisor to the vice president in charge of research. The previous president had also named you advisor to gender equality, alongside Sophie Fermigier. Do you think we're making progress?\nCD: Yes, things are changing – slowly but surely, inexorably. Look at all that happened lately at the ENS de Lyon. It's not just a matter of communication. The first congress of gender studies, organized by the GIS Genre, of which the ENS de Lyon is a founding member, was held here in September 2014. The junior lab Genere has organized many memorable events encouraging in-depth and rigorous debates on the topic. Female students have founded the club \"Salopettes\". Have you seen the posters they've pinned up everywhere, even in the restrooms, to appeal to university students? Take the time to read them. I support their initiative. There are also the Expertes. There, the female researchers at Monod are trailing behind those at Descartes.\nI'll tell you a personal story. As a sociologist, I've always talked a lot about gender to my students. But in a way I was keeping a distance. And I remember very well how after a lecture on stereotypes, a student came to me and asked me: \"Why did you say: I'm not a feminist, but…\"? And right there, I realized I needed to do things differently. It was eight or nine years ago. That student, Marlène Benquet, now works at the CNRS, and she's gone quite a long way in research on gender. Every time someone asks me \"are you a feminist?\" and I answer yes, I think of her. Being a feminist is also about seeing the invisible, that well-known glass ceiling. When you're a feminist, you're always asking yourself questions.\nIn all of the projects carried out by the ENS de Lyon, the question of gender and equality is taken into account: for instance, it's one of the overarching themes of the future Laboratory of Education (LLE). Because education is the key to change.\nWhich women have left their mark on you?\nCD: There's not just one, for sure! The latest is philosopher Michèle Le Doeuff (who also happens to be an alumnus!), and I recommend reading her two works, \"L'étude et le rouet\" (\"The study and the spinning wheel\") and \"Le sexe du savoir\" (\"The gender of knowledge\"): both are terribly topical, and reading them is energizing. And in my childhood, one fictional character left her mark on me, and even influenced me: Jo, in Little Women.\nWhat does a sociologist specialized in gender dream of?\nCD: (without any hesitation and with a large smile). Of having nothing left to say!\nNon-exhaustive (and non-chronological) list of gender-themed events and initiatives involving the ENS de Lyon\nThe interdisciplinary project \"Gender and Policy\" of the Triangle Laboratory, set up in 2009. Each year, it organizes conferences open to the general public.\nThe junior lab GenERe (Gender: epistemology and research) aims to encourage debates and dissemination of knowledge around gender, within our school and beyond. It regularly organizes conferences and meetings.\nSeptember 2014: France has its first ever gender congress, hosted by the ENS de Lyon and organized by the GIS Gender. Christine Detrez comments: \"Thanks to my colleagues Pascale Barthélémy and Claude Gautier for leading the project; it allowed me to attend the conferences and debate with other researchers.\"\nJanuary 2016: a space devoted to gender equality issues is set up on the school intranet. It's moderated by Sophie Fermigier and Christine Detrez, named special advisors on the topic.\nLast month, during an administrative meeting, the vice-president in charge of research presented two illustrations on the gender of lab managers. They came with no comment but highlighted the fact there are more women leading laboratories in exact sciences than in human and social sciences at the ENS de Lyon.\nStudents have founded the club \"Salopettes\", following in the footsteps of the \"Simones\". Christine Detrez comments: \"Have you seen the posters they’ve pinned up everywhere, even in the restrooms, to appeal to university students?\" (inspired by the Blog tenure). \"Take the time to read them. I support their initiative.\"\nThe call for LLE (Laboratory of Education) projects is posted on the website of the Triangle laboratory. Christine Detrez comments: \"Don’t forget: the key to change is education.\"\nAnd of course Les Expertes: based on the finding that only 20% of the experts invited in the media are women, in 2012 two journalists created the first Guide to female experts. Initially printed on paper, it's now available online. Its aim is to increase the visibility of women in the public arena and in the media. More than 1,650 female experts are listed in the guide, for some 300 themes and 2,900 key words. As we're writing these lines, only 5 ENS de Lyon researchers are listed in there, exclusively in human and social sciences. Christine Detrez comments: \"Come on Monod girls, we're counting on you to sign up!\"", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}

{"id": "8533", "text": "INDIANAPOLIS – Displaying the positive attitude that energized the Indiana players and fans, interim coach Frank Vogel explained why he believes he should be the next head coach.\n\"One thing I learned the last three months is that I can do this,\" he said. \"I'm confident in my leadership abilities, my management abilities, my coaching abilities. It's been an honor to coach the last few months, it would be an honor to coach in the future.\"\nTeam president Larry Bird was impressed with Vogel's performance. He said the 37-year-old would get the first interview for the head coaching position.\n\"I think Frank did an excellent job, stepping in without the experience of a head coaching job,\" Bird said. \"The way he conducted himself, he brought positive energy to this team. We won more games than we lost. We did it with a young team, a team that's trying to grow.\"\nThe mood around the team quickly changed when Vogel stepped in. Early in his tenure, he claimed that Eastern Conference powers Boston, Miami and Orlando wouldn't want to play the Pacers when — not if — they make the playoffs. He said the talent to win big already existed on the roster, and he told leery Pacers fans to hop on the bandwagon.\nThat confidence earned the respect of the players. Guard Dahntay Jones hopes Vogel returns.\n\"It would be a breath of fresh air to know we have some stability and some consistency,\" Jones said. \"Frank's done an excellent job in the interim. When he's coaching us, the focus is on the positive, helping us get better, helping us find a niche. He's done a great job with us.\"\nForward Tyler Hansbrough's minutes increased dramatically under Vogel.\n\"Frank's done a good job,\" Hansbrough said. \"I don't know what they're going to do. I'm not a part of that process. But he's done a good job.\"\nVogel accomplished what he said he would, yet he felt he could have done more.\n\"I was hopeful it would work better, to be honest with you,\" he said. \"I thought we could have made a serious run this year. This group has a high ceiling. A high ceiling for what they can achieve in the future.\"\nVogel said he understands that the decision on his future could take some time. It's uncertain if Bird will return as team president because he's in the final year of his contract. Either way, Vogel said he'll be patient.\n\"It's really up to Larry and the front office,\" he said. \"Anytime you're making a decision as important as this, you never want to rush into it. Whatever timetable they decide is fine with me.\"\nVogel introduced \"smashmouth\" basketball, an approach that focused on driving to the basket to put pressure on defenses rather than on shooting a lot of 3-pointers. He moved Hansbrough, a second-year player, and Paul George, a rookie, into the starting lineup and restored third-year center Roy Hibbert's confidence.\n\"I believed in the young guys we have on the team, and that if we went with them, the way we utilized them and the way we changed our style of play, that it would work,\" Vogel said. \"I think it did work.\"\nVogel said the day he was hired that he would tighten the playing rotation.\n\"Earlier in the season, guys didn't know it they were dressing or if they were sitting out or if they were going to play,\" Bird said. \"Under Frank, we sort of knew the three guys who weren't going to dress. They knew their roles. There's a lot more communication. I think the last 25, 30 games, Frank did a good job of letting the players know where they stood.\"\nOnce roles became clear, the locker-room environment improved.\n\"We came together as a team,\" Vogel said. \"That doesn't always happen, where guys really pull for each other and genuinely care for each other, fight for each other, work for each other and really just come together as a team in the true sense of the word. That's what I'm most proud of with this team.\"\nThe Pacers won seven of their first 10 under Vogel, then hit a stretch in which they dropped 8 of 9. Indiana rallied to win 10 of its next 15 and clinch a postseason berth.\n\"My message at that point was that competition has a way of raising the level of your play, and it worked out that way,\" Vogel said.\nBird likes the way the Pacers finished the season.\n\"At the end of the season, he got them back,\" he said. \"We probably performed as well in the playoffs than at any part of the season. That's a good sign.\"", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

{"id": "8639", "text": "Indianapolis-based Eli Lilly and Co. (NYSE: LLY) has announced a partnership with the Indiana State Department of Health to accelerate testing for the virus that causes COVID-19. Lilly says it will use its research laboratories to analyze samples taken at Hoosier healthcare facilities, including nursing homes and emergency rooms. Chief Executive Officer David Ricks says the effort should expand the state’s ability to conduct testing and receive results for people who believe they may have the SARS-CoV-2 virus in a timely manner.\nLilly Chief Scientific Officer Daniel Skovronsky joined Ricks and State Health Commissioner Dr. Kristina Box on a media conference call and spoke about the effort.\n“Our scientists have been working day and night for several weeks to implement and validate the testing approach we announce today,” said Skovronsky. “We’ve been challenged by shortages of a number of key reagents required in testing but for the most part, we’ve worked around these shortages either by finding alternatives or in some cases, producing our own reagents. Our lab meets all the required certifications to conduct testing and we’re optimistic in our ability to help accelerate testing in Indiana.”\nIn addition to the testing of samples collected at healthcare facilities, Lilly is piloting a drive-thru testing system that may be able to test patients outside of a healthcare facilities to help avoid further spreading of the virus.\n“While technically challenging, we believe this is possible assuming the continued flow of critical supplies,” said Skovronsky. “We’re currently working through details but we also want to make sure we provide adequate testing capacity to backstop urgent needs at our local hospitals first. That is our first priority.”\nSkovronsky says testing has already begun and once everything is fully operational, the labs could have the capacity to conduct more than 1,000 tests per day as long as supplies are available. He says the partnership with the ISDH has been critical to the implementation of the accelerated testing effort.\n“At the State Department of Health, we started partnering with Lilly from the early stages to tap into the capabilities of this innovative Indiana company,” Box said in a news release. “We know the magnitude of the impact that advances by Lilly can have on how we diagnose and treat Hoosiers and people worldwide, and we’re grateful for Lilly’s commitment to help accelerate solutions.”\nThe announcement of the partnership comes less than a week after Lilly detailed a partnership with Canada-based AbCellera to co-develop antibody products to treat and prevent COVID-19. The companies are partnering with the Vaccine Research Center at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease, which is part of the National Institutes of Health, to find the antibodies most effective in neutralizing the virus.\nLilly says it will not accept money from government agencies, hospitals, insurance companies or patients for conducting or analyzing the tests. Ricks adds the testing will be completely free.\n“This partnership between the Indiana State Department of Health and Eli Lilly and Company will be transformational in our efforts to accelerate testing for COVID-19,” Governor Eric Holcomb said in a statement. “We are grateful for Lilly’s dedication to the health and safety of Hoosiers as we continue to put all of our focus into slowing the spread.”\nAnother Indianapolis company, Roche Diagnostics, has developed test kits for the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the first 400,000 of which are currently being shipped to labs throughout the country. The company says it plans to ship an additional 400,000 kits per week after that.\nSkovronsky says the effort has been an ongoing process.", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}
{"id": "8650", "text": "*You can read the article here as well:\nA few weeks ago, I had the honor and privilege of volunteering as a part of a Disaster Response Team aiding those impacted by the Orville Dam evacuations and the San Jose flooding. This experience opened my eyes and made me realize a few things—here are a few of my reflections and thoughts.\n1. Humanity Transcends All Religions\nI have always believed in this notion, but it is something that I have rarely seen in action. Here I am defining religion as a way of life. A way of life which may or may not conform to a set of certain set of principles, rules, regulations, guidelines, regions, and/or identities. While volunteering, I had the privilege of meeting people from different religious backgrounds and walks of life. People who, on a regular basis, I would not have the opportunity to associate with. This included former members of the military, congregants of the Southern Baptist Church, Hindus, Jews, Sikhs, Atheists, Muslims, and everything in between. The only thing that these folks appear to have in common is their desire to help others. A duty which was not taken lightly.\n2. Not All Heroes Wear Tights and It Really Does Take a Village\nThe response to these disasters was truly a village coming together. Our team brought up donations from the South Bay and the surrounding regions. People flew in from all over the country, leaving the comfort of their family and homes to sacrifice their time and energy. Supplies brought in from all over the USA provided food and shelter. Each person who donated an item, resources, or their time is a hero. What I realized is this: people have good intentions and even if they cannot physically be there, their spirit and well wishes can. I just want to give a shout out to all the volunteers who worked 12 hours shifts. It is mentally and physically exhausting, and they all have my utmost respect and admiration for doing it day after day.\n3. How Can We Prevent This?\nWhile it is great seeing the community coming together like this, the real question is how can we prevent things like this from happening? Climate change will only worsen the impact of events like this and if we do not take precautionary measures, more people will be impacted in the future. From conversations I had with those who were impacted, I learned that there were very few alternatives. If we can come together to aid these people in disasters, what is preventing us from aiding them before these disasters occur? How can we work to provide alternatives?\nThese are not million dollar questions, these are the questions for over a million lives.", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}
{"id": "8655", "text": "Santa Monica is the California that you see on TV. The city would never have come up on our radar if it weren't for a map that we gave to our son. There is a bucket list scratch-off section at\nthe bottom of the map, and I asked him to choose the activity that he would like to do from the list. There were all sorts of options such as go on a safari, hike Macchu Picchu, see a Broadway show. From the many opportunities, he chose, \"Eat Ice Cream on the Santa Monica Pier.\" Thus, proving that even from a young age, the way to a man's heart is through his stomach. Part of me was thankful he chose such a doable bucket list item, and we had never been to California, so the trip planning commenced.\nThis trip was to be part of a grand 10-day adventure around Arizona, California, and Nevada. We planned to spend three nights in Santa Monica catching some sun, seeing the surrounding area, and of course, eating some ice cream to check that bucket list item off. The trip was intended to be the relaxing portion of an otherwise jam-packed itinerary with a new hotel each night. We tend to power travel and see as much as possible. The world is a vast place, and cultural immersion isn't always an option when time is limited. We needed to go just for that relaxation, and Santa Monica turned out to be a perfect choice. It would make an ideal getaway spot for a long weekend or a week with some day trips to Disneyland when it reopens. Please keep reading to see our recommendations for lodging, coffee, and of course, ice cream!\nWhen staying on the coast, for us, easy beach access is a must. We are also loyal to Marriott and will book that brand whenever we can. Marriott International is the largest hotel brand with accommodations in over 130 countries. With over 7000 locations worldwide, we find this brand the most beneficial for our needs, and we can quickly accrue usable points. We appreciate the wide variety of low-end to deluxe choices, but when combined with the Marriott Bonvoy credit card, we capitalize on the point system. This is what we did for our Santa Monica trip, paying nothing but valet fees and taxes for the three night stay. There are various hotel options, Marriott or otherwise in the Santa Monica area, but we ended up choosing the JW Marriott Le Merigot, which was very close to the beach. We also scored beach/pool views from our two rooms.\nI have to brag on the Le Merigot for a hot minute. I realize I just said that I am a Marriott loyalist, but many times I stay at Marriott's that just plain suck (Marriott Nashville was one of those experiences). But, I thoroughly enjoyed the hospitality at Le Merigot. We sat in the bar for hours at night and never felt pressured to buy more than the two drinks each we consumed. The concierge was excellent, and the hotel provided us with free bike rentals and boogie boards. It was an extra perk complimentary to guests because of the lack of continental breakfast. Covid ruined buffets all across America but the Marriott provided a great alternative. In additon, Le Merigot's pool was gorgeous- spotless- and there were beach chairs available for use. They thought of everything and provided it at a very reasonable price. We didn't dine at the hotel because we wanted to try as much as possible in the surrounding area, but the atmosphere was perfect. Globed string lights for alfresco dining is always a favorite and there seemed to be quite a few groups enjoying the ambiance. I don't know that this particular hotel is especially a family-oriented, but we didn't feel out of place with our whole crew in tow.\nBefore this ends up sounding like a Marriott advertisement (remember, I get nothing for this endorsement), I will discuss other highlights of our trip, which you know, means food. We spent three nights and approximately two days in the Santa Monica area arriving late at night after a long drive from Joshua Tree National Park. We had a few things that we wanted to do while in the area,\n1. Check out the Hollywood sign and the Walk of Stars, Chinese Theater, et cetera\n2. See Beverly Hills and Rodeo Drive with those iconic palm-lined streets and mansions of the rich and famous.\n3. Spend time at Santa Monica Pier and Beach\nWe checked off 1 and 2 and were so unenthused about them we barely got out of the car. I guess\nwe are country folk at heart. The city bustle, expensive bags, and designer belts do not have the allure of a giant cinnamon, sugar-coated, funnel cake covered in velvety, chocolate ice cream and wacky pictures from a photo booth. Even though Pacific Park, the amusement park located on the Santa Monica Pier, was closed as were many of the restaurants in the area (casualties of Coronavirus), this still was one of our trip highlights. Walking the pier and shopping at the little souvenir shops was fun, and our youngest was mesmerized by the fishermen pulling all nature of sea life out of the ocean. We saw them catch little rays and glimmering fish one after the other. It must have been a good day. The pigeons were enjoying the view. And as evening approached, those of\nus who were inclined to go for a bike ride rode over to Venice Beach to experience a whole different vibe. It was a people-watching paradise, and I was surprised to see boom boxes and roller skates, thinking somebody only staged that stuff for TV or Instagram, but\nno. They were living in some weird alternative 80s throwback era where pot was legal. And it was everywhere. Something that I am not used to living in a state where it is only for medical use. Needless to say, we loved the beach and all of the activities that the area seemed to encourage. I can understand why there were so many beautiful people. They are all outside, soaking up the gorgeous rays and exercising. I could get used to this.\nOn the other hand, the food options were excellent, which may encourage me to overeat. One of the most memorable meals was from Rakkan Ramen (pronounced Rockin', Yelp review here), from the saffron sprinkled Brussels sprouts to the sake flights, the experience was delicious. Living up to their namesake, this is some of the best ramen I have ever eaten. We had two varieties, and I would recommend either. In our usual fashion, we tried to eat as much variety as possible so you, dear reader, would know where to find the best flavors. The family faves were the Chicken Buns, the Brussels Sprouts Hot Salad, the Ken \"Sword\" Sake, and the Amber Ramen. The Sword sake was expansive with notes of strawberry and banana making it very memorable. The seaweed salad was tasty, but be advised; it is mostly greens with a sprinkling of seaweed. The salad is a nice twist on the traditional but do not expect a lot of seaweed. Rakkan Ramen is a chain restaurant, but it was new to us, so we were glad we ignored our usual stance against franchised eateries. The food was tasty and worth the stop. Some Yelp reviewers called the restaurant overpriced for ramen, but the quality was so good that the $16 bowl was well worth it in our opinion. And everything is more expensive in California, am I right?\nAnother noteworthy restaurant was Capo Cantina, which in Yelp was formerly Cora's Coffee Shop. We went to Capo Cantina for breakfast and were seated almost immediately. The service was terrific, and the waiter gave us insight into all of the local attractions. The service was so kind and welcoming that it almost didn't matter what they served us, but the food was great too! We had very authentic tasting huevos rancheros with a delicious chorizo side, excellent pancakes, and a spectacular Salmon Plate special and some other items that you can see on my Yelp review. I cannot say that this breakfast was cheap; expect to spend about $20 per entrée, but it was delicious. The only thing that I wasn't nuts about was the Coffee Frizzante, $8. A sort of cold coffee with sparkling water infused into it. It was bitter as hell, and it took a lot to get past the carbonated aspects. I should have added\nsweetener, but I try to avoid as much added sugar as possible on vacation. Vacations always seem to be full of unhealthy choices, which brings me to the reason for our Santa Monica trip, the ice cream!\nThere were not, admittedly, very many choices for ice cream on the Pier when we went. Covid-19 had shut down so many businesses, but this doesn't diminish the enjoyment we found in eating the scrumptious treats at Funnel Cakes (Yelp). As stated before, the Pier is such a groovy and iconic Californian, if not American, spot, and funnel cakes that originated in America seemed fitting accompaniment for the ice cream. Again, the biggest complaint by reviewers of this place was the price (around $8). I think by now, people should realize that food is pricy in California and all vacation spots in general. If you want to eat on a dime, go to a local grocery store and stock up on delicious local wines and cheeses, or expect to spend a little more on vacation, plan for it and enjoy yourself!\nOverall, Santa Monica has so much to offer, but it is best to enjoy it as a rest and relax weekend and not try and stuff too many day trips in like we did. Enjoy the sun and surf, borrow a bike, ride the bike trail, and cap off the day by heading to the Pier for some oysters on the half shell with a pitcher of sangria. I cannot think of a better way to spend a weekend.\nIf you have been to Santa Monica, please do drop a comment and let us know your favorite things to do and your favorite places to eat. We are most definitely going back again, and I would love to try your picks!\nPeace, Love, and Ice Cream\nFor more info, check our Wanderlog", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

{"id": "8674", "text": "Can Restoring Parks Lead To Better Health In Wyandotte County?\nTake a Saturday morning bike ride along the Kansas side of the state line and you’ll see plenty of people playing tennis, soccer and jogging in Johnson County. Ride a bit farther north to Wyandotte County, though, and it’s clear that outdoor recreation is a much rarer phenomenon.\nOn a map, the counties appear to have about the same amount of parks and recreational space. But over several decades, Wyandotte County’s parks fell into a state of neglect and disrepair – to the point of being ignored by many residents.\nNow that many Wyandotte County leaders are looking at ways to improve residents’ health, they’re reevaluating the importance of parks, hopeful their once-grand park system will undergo a rebirth.\nTo understand how different the counties' parks can be, it helps to visit them in person.\nOn the western edge of Kansas City, Kansas, in Wyandotte County, a team of 8-year-old boys in giant pads huddle up and shout a cheer led by teammate Cecil Cotton, a small powerhouse with a voice that can be heard across the field.\n“He’s a mouth. He’s a grown man in a little kid’s body,” Cotton’s father, also named Cecil, says with a laugh.\nThe elder Cotton is a coach in the KC United Youth Footballleague, which plays weekly in an empty field next to a church.\nLeague organizer Adrion Roberson says that what happens here on Saturday mornings is about much more than fun and games.\n“It causes community, so you have a community of families and teams that come together all for the kids,” Roberson says.\nIn Johnson County to the south, a similar scene unfolds, with cheering parents and diminutive athletes. But there’s the big difference: At Heritage Park in Olathe, Kansas, the fenced-off football complex boasts 10 carefully trimmed fields, towering light fixture and bleachers. Fans enjoy amenities that include a snack bar, ample parking and restrooms.\nThe action on the field may be similar, but the facilities are in an altogether different league.\nThat wasn’t always the case.\n'Facebook of 1900s'\nJust west of downtown Kansas City, Kansas, you can see the green space, pond and stone walls that were created as part of the original Waterway Park 100 years ago.\n“It was the Facebook of the 1900’s. It’s where everybody went to socialize,” says Jeremy Rogers, director of the Parks and Recreation Department for the Unified Government of Wyandotte County/Kansas City, Kansas.\nThe area was once home to an elaborate park system including sunken gardens, baseball fields and winding walkways. The park system was designed in part by George Kessler, the legendary landscape architect who masterminded Kansas City’s boulevard system and created renowned parks throughout the country.\nBut a few decades after Waterway Park’s creation, as white flight to the suburbs accelerated and the tax base eroded, the county started a long downward slide that reached crisis levels by the 1980s.\n“So with that, tax dollars went away,” Rogers says. “People started moving out of the city. And once that hit, Wyandotte County’s parks system really bottomed out.”\nAn uptick in crime exacerbated the trend. Many residents no longer felt safe in certain parts of town.\nWhen Wyandotte County consolidated with the Kansas City, Kansas, government in 1997, the parks department was scrapped. Control of the parks was handed over to the public works department, which was essentially put on life support.\n“They were understaffed,” Rogers says. “Not enough equipment. And they were just – as things happened – trying to react to it.”\nThe decline of urban parks in the wake of white flight wasn’t unique to Kansas City, Kansas, saysJames Sallis, a professor of family medicine and public health at the University of California-San Diego.\nIt happened in low-income areas throughout the country in the second half of the 20th century, he says. Urban planners now see it as a major loss.\n“These are essential components of a community if you want your community to be healthy,” Sallis says.\nMore than green space\nIt’s precisely residents of low-income communities who tend to need parks most. But green spaces alone are not enough.\n“We find that parks without many facilities for activity get visited less and generate less physical activity, regardless of size,” Sallis says.\nTo attract residents, urban planners say, parks must have well-maintained sports facilities and trails, along with amenities like restrooms, water fountains and parking. And residents need to feel safe there.\nThe Unified Government brought back the parks and recreation department a few years ago with the help of grant funding. Since then, it has undertaken many incremental renovations and updates.\nBut now it’s got more ambitious ideas, including an expansion of the parks west of downtown Kansas City, Kansas, as part of the Unified Government’s “Healthy Campus” plan.\nIn the same vein, the Unified Government’s Healthy Communities Wyandotte program includes an infrastructure action team made up of community leaders who aim to build 20 miles of bike lanes, trails and sidewalks over the next four years.\nWill that be enough to attract residents? If you build it, will they come?\n“It probably takes a little more nudging than that,” Sallis acknowledges.\nIn the past decade, health experts working to eliminate food deserts have discovered that communities with new grocery stores often need to be reintroduced to healthy foods. And getting neighbors back into parks may require a similar strategy.\n“If there are programs going on or events that are advertised, and your neighbors are going, then you’ve got multiple reasons to go to the park,” Sallis says. “You say, ‘Oh, I’ll go to this event. Looks like fun. And you get there, ‘Hey, this park has been updated and looks really good, so maybe I’ll come back again.’”\nRachel Jefferson, who heads the Historic Northeast-Midtown Association, is aiming to do just that – get people to take advantage of that green space.\nJefferson grew up in the Kansas City area, left to attend college and recently returned to be part of what she hopes will be a renaissance for Kansas City, Kansas.\nA few months ago she started a walking group to get people out on the Jersey Creek Trail, which was renovated in 2015.\nRight now, the group has just five members, but Jefferson says she doesn’t necessarily measure success by numbers.\n“It’s in the little victories, as much in life is anyway,” Jefferson says.\nEven if it’s slow going at first, the idea is for groups like hers to get more people to use the county’s parks. And she’s hopeful that improved physical health will be just one of its many benefits.\n“The more we can spend time together, getting to know each other, and breed that sense of community, the stronger our community will inherently become,” she says.\nAlex Smith is a reporter for KCUR, a partner in the Heartland Health Monitor team.

{"id": "8720", "text": "Reasons Why You Should Hire an Attorney If You Commit Breach of Contract\nIf you have a contract with someone and have committed a breach of it, you may want to hire a lawyer. In addition to getting your claim heard, you may also have a chance to recover punitive damages from the person you wronged. A lawyer can also help you come up with alternative dispute resolution methods.\nCost of hiring a lawyer\nIf you want to retain legal counsel, there are many factors to consider. Depending on your state, the maximum amount you can be liable for is usually $25,000. However, there are certain states with higher limits. For instance, Ohio’s cap on money damages is over $10,000.\nThe most cost-effective strategy is to work out a solution with the other party. However, if the other party fails to fulfill their obligations, you may have to sue for the damages. A better contract will help to avoid this issue.\nYou might be surprised to learn that hiring a lawyer to fix your breach of contract is costly. Lawyers typically charge between 35 percent and 50 percent of their legal fees. This fee is often billed in 10- or 15-minute increments.\nA lawyer’s responsibilities include keeping the client informed about the case and preparing it for trial. They must also stay abreast of any new legal developments. Some lawyers may violate their responsibilities by misusing funds, abandoning the case, or even lying to the client.\nOne of the best ways to keep costs down is to use a flat-fee contract drafting service. This type of drafting is more predictable than the hourly-based option. Please click https://bc-llp.com/ for more information.\nAlternative dispute resolution options\nIf you’re looking for a more affordable, faster, and more convenient alternative to court, you have come to the right place. ADR, or alternative dispute resolution, can help you resolve a dispute without the hefty costs of a traditional lawsuit. And the best part? You can do it yourself! There are companies out there that specialize in helping you to avoid a shoddy case altogether!\nThere are two main types of ADR, including mediation and arbitration. Both have merits, and each can be useful to a certain extent. For example, mediation, often done by a neutral third party, can be a great way to settle a dispute. But it also has its downsides.\nOn the plus side, ADR will likely save you time, energy, and money, which is often a significant concern in any business. It is also an easy and effective way to settle a dispute, as it allows you to tailor the process to your specific needs. As such, it can be an excellent tool in a contract dispute.\nAlthough ADR is not for everyone, it can be a good fit for your company. Whether you are a small start-up or a large corporation, ADR is a cost-effective and time-efficient means to resolve any dispute.\nPunitive damages are imposed when the defendant’s conduct is wildly outrageous or reckless. They are meant to deter other individuals from acting similarly.\nHowever, some states have caps on punitive damages. These limits vary by state; you should always check with a lawyer to get the complete picture.\nFor example, in California, juries are expected to consider various factors when deciding on punitive damages. These factors include the defendant’s reprehensibility, the nature of the breach, and the number of cracks that would deter the defendant from committing such a crime.\nSome courts also look at the duration of the wrongful act and whether the defendant attempted to remedy the offense. The court may also award punitive damages if the illegal act was intentional. The jury also considers the circumstances that mitigate the award of punitive damages.\nMost jurisdictions do not award punitive damages in breach of contract cases. It is due to the concept of “efficient breach” and the theory that the non-breaching party captures a more significant proportion of the economic pie at the expense of the breaching party.\nIn a hypothetical case, an employer and a prospective employee have entered into a business contract. While the parties intend to uphold the terms of the agreement, they can’t.", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

As we have mentioned in previous updates, the biggest obstacle is to secure funding to build the network backbone and infrastructure needed to deliver high-speed data to homes and businesses in our area. As we all know, our terrain and sparse population make this an expensive proposition, that no for-profit company has been willing to undertake without financial assistance.\nDuring early October, the LittleT tech team worked with Balsam West and the Southwestern Commission to help prepare materials for an application to the NC GREAT 2020 CARES Act Supplementary Round grant program. The application was completed and submitted on October 14. The goal is to obtain and use NC GREAT grant funding to help build the network infrastructure needed to reach homes and businesses from the proposed backbone.\nSo, what has happened with the backbone network project?\nAs mentioned in the September update, progress was made with Macon County, and the commissioners approved an RFP (Request For Proposals) back in early August for broadband expansion in south Macon. Winning the RFP comes with the promise of grant funds. The intended usage of the associated grant is to fund the construction of the critical backbone network that will bring connectivity to Otto and Scaly from the Franklin city limits.\nThe county attorney's office and NCIT Broadband division were unable to release the RFP until October 2nd. The timing of this actually worked in our favor, as it allowed focus on the NC GREAT grant application earlier in the month. With work on the GREAT application behind us, we have recently been engaged with Balsam West in helping to prepare materials for the RFP response, which is due Monday, Nov 2.\nWith funding applications and responses submitted, we hope to hear outcomes on these initiatives in the December timeframe.

{"id": "8731", "text": "Portland, Ore. — The National Weather Service has issued a special weather statement for much of western Oregon and Washington for next week.\n...CHANCES INCREASING FOR LOWLAND SNOW NEXT WEEK... A pair of strong cold fronts will move across the Pacific Northwest through the weekend, and the pattern will turn significantly colder next week. These cold fronts will likely bring heavy snow to the Cascades. Snow levels are expected to remain well above the valley floors through Sunday. The colder air is expected to move into southwest Washington and northwest Oregon early next week, potentially cold enough to bring snow levels down to the valley floor. An increasing number of forecast models are suggesting additional disturbances from the Gulf of Alaska which would spread moisture into that colder air. This will raise the chance for snow down to the lowest elevations next week. While accumulations, distribution, and/or timing of snow remain uncertain, confidence is increasing in the overall threat of snow next week, even for the lowest elevations. Now is a good time to make sure you are prepared in the event that all of the necessary ingredients come together for a significant snow event next week. KGW Meteorologist Rod Hill is also watching the system closely.\nToday we’re looking at the very latest runs of the European and the GFS (Global Forecast System) models. Today’s take: The GFS remains consistently cold when compared to its last few runs. If anything, the GFS has trended a little colder.\nThe European model is not as cold as the GFS, but what’s new today is that the Euro has trended colder than its previous runs.\nAs a forecaster, it helps to see some consensus, so this increases our confidence we’re in store for a cold snap next week. That in and of itself will be a bit of a shock for us. Portland International Airport has not officially dropped to freezing since Dec. 26. It’s possible we’re looking at at least a day or two next week where the high temperatures don’t reach freezing.\nAs for snow, we think there will be some wet snowflakes mixed in with rain showers Sunday night and Monday as the colder air arrives behind a departing storm system.\nBeyond, there’s too much variability in the models to lock in on any one particular weather system that might bring the area snow. Those variables include the timing and placement of any storm centers, along with their ultimate track. But we’re especially watching midweek right now.\nWe’ll update this with increasing frequency and more detail as those specifics become more clear.", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}

{"id": "8754", "text": "In this article, we are going to take a closer look at the importance of brand values to your overall brand strategy.\nThe creation of a clear brand strategy is key to making sure that your business differentiates itself from competitors, grows in the right direction and ensures everyone within the company works towards the same goal.\nA core brand strategy consists of several elements:\nIf you need help creating a brand strategy, why not start a conversation with us to find out how we can help you to build your brand while ensuring you speak directly to your target market?\nThe kettle is always on, so book a brew with us today.\nBrand values are the overarching principles behind how a business behaves, guiding both decisions and actions you will take to achieve the company’s mission and vision.\nThey embody both the brand identity and company culture, creating a unique brand personality that resonates with customers and sets the business apart from the competition.\nBrand values lie at the heart of all communications both internal and external and are, therefore, crucial for building brand loyalty by aligning employees and customers alike with these core beliefs.\nBrand values are not just about what your company does, they should characterise everything your brand stands for and how you want it to be perceived.\nHere are some reasons why your brand values are important:\nYour brand is unique, so your values will be different from those of your competitors.\nThis will help you to differentiate your products and services through tone of voice, messaging, and positioning.\nCustomers who feel a strong connection with a brand will tend to be more loyal and help to promote it to others via word of mouth and recommendations.\nBrands that algin themselves with customers’ values will benefit from this loyalty.\nJust think about your favourite brands.\nDo you talk about them to your friends and family?\nAre you more tempted to write recommendations to brands with whom you have affinity?\nIf there is a guiding set of beliefs, principles, or values at the heart of a brand, it will be much easier to be consistent across all touchpoints, reinforcing the brand identity and helping to build trust.\nHaving clear brand values provide focus for decision-making at every level of the business, ensuring decisions drive growth towards the mission and vision.\nWe have said the word.\nOverused in the marketing environment, we agree, but nonetheless, you want your customers to feel comfortable in doing business with you.\nIf you can instil trust because customers know what your brand stands for, they feel more confident to continue buying from you.\nBrand values are the foundation of your employer brand and when aligned to employee core beliefs and values, they will feel more connected and motivated to do a good job or provide the best service for your customers.\nAlignment can also improve the candidate experience, lead to higher retention rates, and enhance a brand’s reputation because employee satisfaction is higher.\nThe better your brand reputation, the more positively you will be viewed and represented, resulting in more business opportunities.\nBelieve it or not, your brand values already exist, but they may not be written down anywhere.\nThey embody the spirit or essence of your company, are evident in how you do business and are present in how you want your brand to be perceived by others.\nHere’s how to develop your brand values:\nTalk to the rest of the team to discover the key components or concepts that lie at the heart of your brand identity.\nTo help you to do this, you can pull together information from a number of different key areas, such as employee research, competitor research, and customer feedback to find out the key trends or concepts that lie at the heart of the business, differentiate you from competitors, and resonate with stakeholders.\nFrom the key trends and concepts, identify the unique and memorable values that form the essence of your brand and how you want it to be seen by others.\nThe next step is to prioritise them, based on how important and relevant they are to your brand and whether they encompass the brand mission and brand vision.\nOnce you have identified and prioritised your brand values, you need to add a practical definition that will guide behaviours, decisions, and actions.\nThe final step is to communicate the brand values to all stakeholders, internally and externally.\nMessaging, tone of voice, and brand behaviour should be guided by these values, whilst employees need to understand how they can embody them in their actions and behaviour.\nBrand values are an essential part of any brand strategy.\nThey help to build trust, reflect personality, and differentiate one brand from another in the marketplace.\nMoreover, when aligned with stakeholder values, they can establish a connection that provide a foundation for higher engagement and motivation of employees and building a loyal customer base.\nIf you don’t know where to start and would like to talk to us about the importance of brand values, Make a Brew can help. We can work with you to create a brand strategy for your company, helping you to define your brand values to make sure your brand stands out from competitors.

The scene documents the confrontation between the Roman army and Iberian warriors, the first contact between two very different worlds.

In contrast, the Iberian warrior at his feet wears a short tunic cinched with a belt and holds a typical Iberian round shield.\nOver time, the Iberians gradually assimilated Roman social customs, including their fashions, as illustrated by the contrast between the youth wrapped in a cape and shoulder mantle, traditional Iberian garments, and the man wearing the toga typical of Roman citizens.

However, among non-Hispanic males, the two were associated with each other independent of obesity, suggesting that unknown factors may be at work.\nResearchers studying a large sample of adolescent American boys have found an association between metabolic syndrome, which is a complication of obesity, and elevated liver enzymes that mark potentially serious liver disease.\nThe link between metabolic syndrome and the suspected liver disease did not appear in adolescent girls, said study leader Rose C. Graham, M.D., a pediatric gastroenterologist at The Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. There were ethnic differences among the boys as well, she added, between Hispanic and non-Hispanic males.\nThe study appears in the October 2009 print edition of the Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition.\nMetabolic syndrome is of concern as a risk factor for cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes, and is estimated to occur in 22 percent of U.S. adults and 4 percent of U.S. adolescents. It is defined by insulin resistance, increased waist circumference, high blood pressure, and abnormal measures of high density lipoprotein (“good cholesterol”) and triglycerides in the blood. The criteria are similar for pediatric metabolic syndrome, although there is some dispute over details of the definition.\nIn adults, researchers have shown an association between metabolic syndrome and a group of diseases called nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), which at its most severe, may progress to irreversible liver damage. The purpose of the current study was to investigate to what extent metabolic syndrome in adolescents was associated with elevated levels of the liver enzyme alanine aminotransferase (ALT), a marker of NAFLD.\nGraham and colleagues analyzed a nationally representative sample of 1,323 U.S. adolescents, aged 12 to 19, from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. They found a strong association between metabolic syndrome and elevated ALT levels in adolescent males, but not in adolescent females.\nWhile looking more carefully at this association in boys, they found that among Hispanic males, this association largely coincided with being obese, as measured by body mass index. The researchers expected to find this correlation, because for all ethnicities, obesity was already known to be a risk factor for both metabolic syndrome and NAFLD. However, they also found that among non-Hispanic adolescent boys, metabolic syndrome and high ALT levels were associated with each other, independent of obesity. “Something else seems to be going on, in addition to the effects of obesity,” said Graham. “Some unknown factors may be at work here.”\nThe finding may have implications for treatment, she added. Currently, the only known treatment for NAFLD is weight loss. “If some adolescents with metabolic syndrome may be susceptible to this liver disease regardless of whether or not they are obese, there may be other treatments yet to be discovered.”\nNAFLD is increasingly being recognized among overweight teenagers. “Our findings suggest that NAFLD in adolescents merits closer attention, and its treatment may require more than just weight loss,” said Graham.", "scores": {"score": 3, "score_transform_1": 5, "score_transform_2": 5, "score_transform_3": 0}}

{"id": "8805", "text": "Microsoft-pomo Stephen Elopin lähettämä viesti leikkauksista yhtiön työntekijöille on saanut osakseen suoranaista kauhistusta.\nElopin \"Hello there\" -viesti\nMicrosoft’s strategy is focused on productivity and our desire to help people “do more.” As the Microsoft Devices Group, our role is to light up this strategy for people. We are the team creating the hardware that showcases the finest of Microsoft’s digital work and digital life experiences, and we will be the confluence of the best of Microsoft’s applications, operating systems and cloud services.\nTo align with Microsoft’s strategy, we plan to focus our efforts. Given the wide range of device experiences, we must concentrate on the areas where we can add the most value. The roots of this company and our future are in productivity and helping people get things done. Our fundamental focus – for phones, Surface, for meetings with devices like PPI, Xbox hardware and new areas of innovation -- is to build on that strength. While our direction in the majority of our teams is largely unchanging, we have had an opportunity to plan carefully about the alignment of phones within Microsoft as the transferring Nokia team continues with its integration process.\nIt is particularly important to recognize that the role of phones within Microsoft is different than it was within Nokia. Whereas the hardware business of phones within Nokia was an end unto itself, within Microsoft all our devices are intended to embody the finest of Microsoft’s digital work and digital life experiences, while accruing value to Microsoft’s overall strategy. Our device strategy must reflect Microsoft’s strategy and must be accomplished within an appropriate financial envelope. Therefore, we plan to make some changes.\nWe will be particularly focused on making the market for Windows Phone. In the near term, we plan to drive Windows Phone volume by targeting the more affordable smartphone segments, which are the fastest growing segments of the market, with Lumia. In addition to the portfolio already planned, we plan to deliver additional lower-cost Lumia devices by shifting select future Nokia X designs and products to Windows Phone devices. We expect to make this shift immediately while continuing to sell and support existing Nokia X products.\nTo win in the higher price segments, we will focus on delivering great breakthrough products in alignment with major milestones ahead from both the Windows team and the Applications and Services Group. We will ensure that the very best experiences and scenarios from across the company will be showcased on our products. We plan to take advantage of innovation from the Windows team, like Universal Windows Apps, to continue to enrich the Windows application ecosystem. And in the very lowest price ranges, we plan to run our first phones business for maximum efficiency with a smaller team.\nWe expect these changes to have an impact to our team structure. With our focus, we plan to consolidate the former Smart Devices and Mobile Phones business units into one phone business unit that is responsible for all of our phone efforts. Under the plan, the phone business unit will be led by Jo Harlow with key members from both the Smart Devices and Mobile Phones teams in the management team. This team will be responsible for the success of our Lumia products, the transition of select future Nokia X products to Lumia and for the ongoing operation of the first phone business.\nAs part of the effort, we plan to select the appropriate business model approach for our sales markets while continuing to offer our products in all markets with a strong focus on maintaining business continuity. We will determine each market approach based on local market dynamics, our ability to profitably deliver local variants, current Lumia momentum and the strategic importance of the market to Microsoft. This will all be balanced with our overall capability to invest.\nOur phone engineering efforts are expected to be concentrated in Salo, Finland (for future, high-end Lumia products) and Tampere, Finland (for more affordable devices). We plan to develop the supporting technologies in both locations. We plan to ramp down engineering work in Oulu. While we plan to reduce the engineering in Beijing and San Diego, both sites will continue to have supporting roles, including affordable devices in Beijing and supporting specific US requirements in San Diego. Espoo and Lund are planned to continue to be focused on application software development.\nWe plan to right-size our manufacturing operations to align to the new strategy and take advantage of integration opportunities. We expect to focus phone production mainly in Hanoi, with some production to continue in Beijing and Dongguan. We plan to shift other Microsoft manufacturing and repair operations to Manaus and Reynosa respectively, and start a phased exit from Komaron, Hungary.\nIn short, we will focus on driving Lumia volume in the areas where we are already successful today in order to make the market for Windows Phone. With more speed, we will build on our success in the affordable smartphone space with new products offering more differentiation. We’ll focus on acquiring new customers in the markets where Microsoft’s services and products are most concentrated. And, we’ll continue building momentum around applications.\nWe plan that this would result in an estimated reduction of 12,500 factory direct and professional employees over the next year. These decisions are difficult for the team, and we plan to support departing team members with severance benefits.\nMore broadly across the Devices team, we will continue our efforts to bring iconic tablets to market in ways that complement our OEM partners, power the next generation of meetings & collaboration devices and thoughtfully expand Windows with new interaction models. With a set of changes already implemented earlier this year in these teams, this means there will be limited change for the Surface, Xbox hardware, PPI/meetings or next generation teams.\nWe recognize these planned changes are broad and have very difficult implications for many of our team members. We will work to provide as much clarity and information as possible. Today and over the coming weeks leaders across the organization will hold town halls, host information sharing sessions and provide more details on the intranet.\nThe team transferring from Nokia and the teams that have been part of Microsoft have each experienced a number of remarkable changes these last few years. We operate in a competitive industry that moves rapidly, and change is necessary. As difficult as some of our changes are today, this direction deliberately aligns our work with the cross company efforts that Satya has described in his recent emails. Collectively, the clarity, focus and alignment across the company, and the opportunity to deliver the results of that work into the hands of people, will allow us to increase our success in the future.\nArvostelun kohteeksi on joutunut kirjeen tyyli:\nElop aloittaa viestinsä\"Heippa vaan siellä\" (Hello There) -toteamuksella.\nVarsinaista asiaa, eli henkilöstövähennyksiä käsitellään vasta viestin loppupuolella lyhyesti kahdella lauseella.\nThe Guardian toteaa sivuillaan, että Elopin viesti on oppitunti siitä, miten ei ilmoiteta 12 500 työpaikan leikkauksista.\nLehden sivuilla ihmetellään, että luetuttiko Nokian johtajana ennen toiminut Elop viestiään kenelläkään ennen sen lähettämistä.\nThe Guardian kritisoi, että kun Elop vihdoin pääsee viestissään itse asiaan, eli vähennyksiin, niin muutaman lauseen jälkeen viestissä palataan taas hehkuttamaan \"ikonisia\" tabletteja.\nMuistatko vielä \"Palava öljylautta\" -muistion?\nElop muistetaan myös takavuosien surullisenkuuluisasta \"Palava öljylautta\" -kohumuistiosta.\nTuossa viestissä Elop vertasi Nokian tilannetta palavaan öljylauttaan, jolta on hypättävä.\nJo viestin metafora oli niin huono, että se vaikutti negatiivisesti Nokian tuolloiseen laitemyyntiin.\n\"Jargonia ja johdon uhoa\"\nThe Guardian toteaa, että Elopin viimeisin viesti on jargonin-täyteistä johdon uhoamista.\n-Applella ja Samsungilla ei ole mitään pelättävää, kiteyttää The Guardian.\nElopin ohessa näkyvä viesti on noin 1100 merkkiä pitkä.

Gaidai said Russia controls more than half of the city but the situation of Ukrainian troops is “difficult but under control.” Ukrainian officials have warned some units in eastern Ukraine are running low on artillery shells for Soviet-era weapons and do not yet have enough newer artillery pieces to replace the older systems.\n- Beijing officials have reintroduced mass testing mandates and closed public venues less than a week after lifting harsh restrictions, warning of a “ferocious” COVID-19 outbreak after the official case count increased sixfold over the weekend. Shanghai officials have also instituted mass testing in 15 of the city’s 16 districts.\n- United Nations human rights head Michelle Bachelet said Monday she won’t seek another turn in the role when her four-year term ends in August. She cited personal reasons and said the decision was made before recent sharp criticism from U.S. officials and others for her trip to China—Bachelet made a China-controlled visit and praised its poverty reduction efforts while using China’s counter-terrorism terminology for mass detainment of Uyghurs and other ethnic and religious minorities.\nInflation Sets Another 40-year Record\nNot to be dramatic, but inflation has snatched our wallets, chucked them in a grocery cart, doused it in gasoline, and pushed the whole thing into a blast furnace while the Federal Reserve has been running around in the background yelling DON’T PANIC and brandishing a fire extinguisher on a time delay.\nUniversity of Michigan reports consumer sentiment has hit a record low. Which is kind of fair, based on Friday’s inflation report. In May, the Consumer Price Index report showed, inflation hit yet another 40-year high of 8.6 percent year over year, reversing April’s fall to 8.3 percent.\nGas prices helped lead the way, rising 4.1 percent from April to May and topping an average of $5 a gallon Sunday, according to automobile association AAA. One Massachusetts gas station owner stopped selling fuel in protest—which seems counterproductive, but we appreciate the thought. Even the IRS has noticed rising gas prices, hiking its maximum mileage reimbursement rate to compensate. “The pain U.S. consumers are feeling at the pump will get worse before it gets better,” analysts at credit ratings firm Moody’s Analytics wrote Thursday, predicting prices may reach $5.50 over the next few weeks, but then forecasting a steady decline.\nOther prices outpaced gasoline’s gains. Airfare rose 13 percent from April to May, and housing jumped 5.5 percent. Food overall rose 1.2 percent May over April, including a 5 percent increase in the price of eggs, thanks in part to an outbreak of bird flu. The U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates this outbreak will spike the price of eggs by about 20 percent this year.

{"id": "8845", "text": "Magic happens every day in Nashville.\nAny garage, living room or makeshift studio space could be the birthplace of a life-shaping soundtrack. From first drafts to final recordings, some of the most influential albums in American history came to life inside rooms haunted by melodies from songwriting titans: Cash, Parton, Dylan, Kristofferson, Prine, Brooks, Lambert, Swift … and the list goes on.\nArtists trek to Pie Town hideaways, huddle in Berry Hill basements or enlist polished Music Row operations. Every note could bring a songwriter closer to an idea — discovered after the first spin through Bob Dylan’s “Blonde On Blonde” or Taylor Swift’s “Red” — that they could cut a generation-shaping album.\nDespite an ever-changing landscape for artists and fans, album-making remains a signature artwork that at its biggest can help define culture and — at its most intimate — offers an unshakable companion for life’s everyday wonders. TikTok fame? Instagram engagement? For some who enter Nashville virtually endless row of studios, disposable metrics come second to crafting a collection of songs that’ll long outlive the songwriter.\nAnd in a city where some chase polished radio singles and fashionable trends, album-making continues to be a creative linchpin that can pull together an auditorium of sweaty, cathartic singalongs and propel once small-town singers to award season stages.\n“Nashville has been above and beyond with talent,” said Dave Cobb, a Grammy Award-winning producer with credits including Chris Stapleton, Jason Isbell and John Prine. “Incredible artists. Great singers, great songwriters. That’s why we all move here, right?”\nLiner Notes:Chris Stapleton’s ‘Traveller’ was an album for the ages\nFrom vinyl to cassette tape, CDs, digital downloads, streaming and back to the LP, how fans consume music can feel a bit like playing a sport where the rules can change mid-game.\nAnd what happens when a fan runs on the field to steal the ball? Enter: Piracy. Two decades ago, peer-to-peer file sharing upended the music industry in a way it never experienced before and wouldn’t again until COVID-19 derailed live entertainer.\nFans skipped lines record shops and department store electronics sections — where labels jockeyed weekly for endcap space — to instead steal albums online via Napster, Limewire and similar programs. Music sales — primarily CDs — began a slow spiral downward.\nFor example: In 2000, music revenue topped $14 billion, with $13.2 billion in CD sales, according to the Recording Industry Association of America. By 2010, overall revenue was cut in half, topping at around $7 billion. CD sales dropped to $3.4 billion that year, while digital sale crossed $2 billion.\n“A lot of the erosion of CDs is a long-tailed thing,” said Doyle Davis, co-owner of Grimey’s New and Preloved Music in East Nashville. “I remember when I would go over an visit frineds’ houses and all they were using was an iPod with powered remote speakers. I would be like, ‘That’s your stereo? What happened to your real stereo?’ It got to where [they weren’t] playing CDs any more.”\nBut album-making? It continued. Artists didn’t stop creating, and fans never stopped listening.\nNew albums:Billy Strings’ next album? A covers collection with his dad\nLoretta Lynn: 9 essential songs, from ‘Coal Miner’s Daughter’ to ‘Portland, Oregon’\n“People talk about songs for a second, and it just fades,” said Paul Roper, president of Nashville independent label Dualtone Music Group, home of Americana headliner Lumineers, country singer Hays Carll and more. “But if you have an album, it stands the test of time if it’s connecting and there’s something truly special about it.”\nAround 2014, streaming became a go-to revenue source, a move that simultaneously transformed gatekeeping and music discovery — again.\nAnd while still financially contentious for artists and songwriters who regularly lobby for higher royalty rates, streaming wrangled many from stealing music online into free or paid subscription models. Last year, music revenue neared $15 billion, the highest mark since 2000, according to the RIAA. Paid subscription streaming reached roughly $8.6 billion, more than 50% of all revenue.\nNow — after years fighting to get a proverbial ball back on the field after piracy stole it — what happens if the rules to the game keep changing … and the old rules still exist? That’s releasing an album in 2022.\nArtists and labels must navigate how to release music for all fans — digital natives, hard-copy album collectors, TikTok swipers and old-school CD buyers. Like endcap space decades ago, these groups now work to secure premier real estate on playlists and home pages across multiple streaming platforms, as well as vinyl subscription clubs and traditional storefront placement.\n“Back in the day, it was: Take out some print ads, make sure you’re in the endcap at your chain, physical retail and try to get press and radio,” Roper said. He added, “It can be challenging. I think if you have songs that connect with people, they’ll discover the album.”\nDespite a labyrinth of changes, many artists still want to cut an album sturdy enough to withstand any change the industry faces.\nLast year, country artist Carly Pearce made the best album of her career to-date. The Kentucky-raised singer-songwriter channeled songwriting to grieve her brief marriage and public divorce on “29: Written In Stone,” a 15-song collection that propelled her to earn Female Vocalist of the Year at the CMA Awards and Female Artist of the Year at the ACM Awards.\nThe album connected immediately with women who heard themselves in Pearce’s words. In singing her truth, she printed a musical atlas for others who need to navigate life’s messy moments. While the project initially debuted as a seven-song EP, Pearce said that it didn’t tell a complete story.\n“I put out the EP and I started to realize what I was doing,” Pearce said. “I realized that was just the tip of the iceberg of the story. I wanted to finish the story.”\nSinger-songwriter:Margo Price ‘owns her truth’ in new book ‘Maybe We’ll Make It’\nNew album:Kelsea Ballerini’s season of change: ‘I call this my first grown-up album’\nFor some artists, like sisterly roots outfit Larkin Poe, creativity doesn’t come in single-song slices. Albums can capture entire creative seasons of songs that come in inspirational bursts of three or four at a time.\nAnd three minutes may not be long enough to share someone’s entire story.\n“For me as a songwriter, being able to create a body of work - instead of just a hand or a head, some isolated, creative endeavor - feels a lot more natural,” said Larkin Poe co-founder Rebecca Lovell.\nLarkin Poe co-founder Megan Lovell added, “It is nice to have more than just one song to be able to tell a story. And that’s the beauty of the creation of an album.”\nSometimes, an album just needs to be an album — like Lucinda Williams’ “Car Wheels On a Gravel Road,” Randy Travis’ “Storms of Change” or Shania Twain’s “Come On Over.”\nThe same could be said for Chris Stapleton’s “Traveller.”\n“People knew [‘Traveller’] was an album,” Cobb said. “It wasn’t meant to be broken up. … [you] put the whole thing on and really understand where he’s comin’ from at the time.”\nLike playing a game from first to final whistle, releasing an album continues to make sense for industry gatekeepers investing top dollar in radio campaigns and marketing pushes for new music.\n“Just all of the expenses that go into a recording an album - so many of our artists, fans buy their music in physical form - the economics of it still tilt heavily towards an album,” said David Macias, owner of Nashville independent label Thirty Tigers.\nAlbums largely remain a narrative-driven anchor in an artists’ career that media can embrace, Macias said.\n“The press, maybe through a little bit of muscle memory, still treats the album the album release as the inciting event,” he said. “‘Here’s a body of where. This is what the artists’ come to say.'”\nBut delivery and discovery continues to change with each new Spotify feature and Apple Music campaign. For example, artists typically release multiple singles ahead of an album in a “waterfall” on streaming services, meaning fans can play each pre-released track simulantiously in a playlist that hopefully drives discovery to more than one new song.\nAdditionally, labels release remixes, deluxe editions and behind-the-scenes audio commentary in hopes of drawing new ears to an original album on streaming platforms. These providers can also push releases by email campaigns, push notifications and homepage algorithms that remind listeners of a new album.\n“You can see a world where [music] does become more track-focused and more people are invested in passive playlists - they don’t know the artist,” Roper said. “But I think what we’ve seen it our artists [who] are translating a unique story in a compelling way are having careers. And careers are still tied to a record.”\nAnd on top of the ever-changing rules for digital music, a long-pressed medium continues to regrow in popularity: Vinyl. In 2021, vinyl sales surpassed $1 billion for the first time since 1986, according to the RIAA. Albums from major star with fans hungry for a hold-it-in-your-hands listening experience - Taylor Swift, Adele and Olivia Rodrigo - topped sales last year.\nUnique vinyl albums:Why Nashville SC is handing out vinyl albums of Hany Mukhtar’s goals this season\nWhy? Maybe because few things can top unwrapping the plastic, unfolding the artwork and sitting down for the first time with a new album spinning through a stereo.\n“In the streaming environment, it’s a largely singles world,” Doyle said, “but when you get to buying vinyl, you’re getting the album experience. We can see from how much demand has increased, kids want that experience.”\nWelcome to Liner notes, a new Tennessean series highlighting some of the ground-shaking albums to be released from Nashville this century (so far). From commercial powerhouses to critical mainstays, we’ll go behind the scenes each month with an album that helped shape today’s Nashville.\nWant to see an album you love covered in an upcoming Liner Notes story?

{"id": "8902", "text": "Hazelnuts are one of the tastiest and crunchiest nuts out there. Do you also like to keep a jar of hazelnuts handy by your side table? Do you also happen to have an adorable dog as your friend and companion?\nWell, if the answer to the above questions is yes, chances are you are tempted from time to time to feed hazelnuts to your dog. This is even more tempting when he/she looks at you with expectant eyes.\nBut can dogs eat hazelnuts? Are there risks? Let us find out!\n- Hazelnuts: What You Need to Know\n- Dogs and Hazelnuts: Is It a Yes or No Question?\n- Are There Any Health Benefits of Hazelnuts for Dogs?\n- What Are the Effects of Hazelnuts on Dogs?\n- Can Puppies Eat Hazelnuts?\n- What Should You Do If Your Dog Has Accidently Popped Hazelnuts?\n- Is Any Other Nut Safe for Dogs?\n- The Final Word\nHazelnuts: What You Need to Know\nHazelnuts are laden with a lot of ‘good food traits’, including a lot of nutrients, vitamins, healthy fats and antioxidants, that make them almost irresistible.\nIn human beings, the consumption of hazelnuts has been found to promote a healthy heart, regulate blood pressure and improve blood sugar among other benefits.\nIt is also a great source of reducing oxidative stress that leads to premature aging.\nIt literally offers a pocketful of goodness, but does it have the same benefits for canines? And will it impact the health of your dog in a similar way?\nDogs and Hazelnuts: Is It a Yes or No Question?\nTo answer succinctly, yes, dogs can eat hazelnuts in theory.\nTo begin with, hazelnuts are not going to cause any severe issues in your dog and are not toxic for them. If you happen to give your dog one or two hazelnuts while munching on them yourself, all will be fine with your dog and the world.\nThe real problem, however, is the size of the hazelnuts.\nThese nuts, much like almonds, are of a precarious size when it comes to dogs. Smaller puppies can choke on them causing a series of issues.\nIf you have a grown-up dog, chances are he/she will try to swallow it instead of chewing. As a result of this mindless gobbling, the hazelnut can get stuck in its intestine, leading to a range of stomach issues.\nAlso Read: Can Dogs Eat Sunflower Seeds?\nAre There Any Health Benefits of Hazelnuts for Dogs?\nAs discussed above, hazelnuts despite being full of benefits to humans, don’t serve a great purpose for a dog’s health.\nHowever, as hazelnuts are a great source of protein, if your dog accidentally eats one or two hazelnuts, it is not going to cause a major problem.\nSome peripheral benefits of hazelnuts that may or may not be beneficial to dogs include better fluid retention, better joint health and the prevention of osteoporosis.\nHowever, it is better that you don’t give in to the cuteness of your dog and keep the bowl or jar of hazelnuts away from their reach.\nWhat Are the Effects of Hazelnuts on Dogs?\nNow that we have cautioned you against feeding hazelnuts to your dogs, it is only fair that you are made aware of the effects this popular and tasty nut can have on your dog.\nMay Induce Obesity\nHazelnuts are known to promote obesity in dogs. This can be particularly alarming for dogs already struggling with excessive weight.\nThis is because hazelnuts are rich in fat content. It is also crucial to note that both good and bad fat can lead to weight gain unless monitored efficiently.\nTherefore, hazelnuts can make your dog fat and also lead to complications that arise with excessive weight such as diabetes, frailing joint health and a significant drop in their energy levels.\nMay Adversely Impact Your Dog’s Pancreas\nExcess fat is not only something that concerns human beings. It may lead to health complications in dogs as well.\nAs hazelnuts are rich in fats, they can ring the knell for your dog’s pancreas. This is a very serious problem and should not be taken lightly at all.\nRegular consumption of hazelnut can lead to fat accumulation in their body over a period of time inflaming their pancreas and causing fat deposits in the surrounding organs as well.\nPancreatic issues are extremely painful and may affect the dog’s digestive system. In some cases, it can also become fatal and potentially life threatening.\nIf you are guilty of feeding your dog hazelnuts, you need to be vigilant of their health and actively lookout for signs of pain and discomfort. Some of the most common signs exhibited by dogs if they are suffering from pancreatic issues include:\n- Persistent vomiting.\n- They may show signs of dehydration and fatigue.\n- Loss of petite and significant drop in their energy levels.\n- General signs of weakness.\n- Signs of fever.\n- An unlikely sharp reaction when you touch their stomach.\nObstruction in the Intestine\nA very common reaction to eating hazelnuts is that your dog may choke on them. Hazelnuts are a tough nut and their size is almost conducive to choking.\nDogs can get excited by them and gobble them up without attempting to chew them. This may cause intestinal blockages and stomach discomfort as the nut will reach the stomach without fully breaking down.\nProblems in the digestive tract may trigger the following symptoms:\n- Excessive vomiting and signs of diarrhea.\n- Drooling and burping uncontrollably.\n- Difficulty in bowel movements.\n- Pain and uneasiness, especially in the abdomen.\n- They may sometimes become irritable.\n- Loss of appetite.\nAlso Read: Can Dogs Eat Granola?\nCan Puppies Eat Hazelnuts?\nIt is recommended to keep your puppy away from hazelnuts as far as possible. With bigger dogs, one or two unsalted hazelnuts may not be life changing but the risks increase for smaller puppies.\nPuppies are more prone to choking on nuts and suffering from digestive issues.\nAlso, puppies are in their growing stages, so this warrants special attention to their diet and food requirements. Though hazelnuts are power packed, they don’t have significant nutritional value for canines.\nAny oversight on your side may strain your puppy’s digestive system from a young age.\nWhat Should You Do If Your Dog Has Accidently Popped Hazelnuts?\nIf despite being careful, your dog manages to gobble up a few hazelnuts, do not worry. It is not toxic and its impacts can be managed if you intervene at the right time.\nHere is what you should do:\n- Watch out for the signs. Even a single sign or unusual behavior must be taken into account.\n- Consult your vet immediately as they may have a better solution than you. Please don’t try to treat your dog yourself in such a situation.\nVets are qualified to handle such situations and are better suited to find a good solution quicker.\nIs Any Other Nut Safe for Dogs?\nNuts, though usually non-toxic, are high in fat content. This makes them potentially unsuitable for dogs. If you feed your dog nuts regularly, they may suffer from obesity and water retention.\nOther nuts that are totally unsafe for dogs include walnuts and almonds, to name a few. Macadamia nuts are even toxic and can be life threatening.\nSome people tend to feed peanuts to their pets. This is not recommended and if you want, you should only feed one or two peanuts to your pet and that too unsalted.\nIf your puppy gets too needy when it sees you popping nuts, you should do that away from his or her eyes. It is in their best interests.\nFinally, if you want to add variety to your dog’s food, it is best to consult a vet. Keeping nuts outside the food chart is only going to stand you and your pet in good stead.\nAlso Read: Can Dogs Eat Chicken Feet?\nThe Final Word\nHazelnuts are known to have many benefits for human beings. They are great for the skin, heart and joint health. Unfortunately, the nut doesn’t have the same effect on dogs and it is advisable to not feed your pet any hazelnut.\nThis is because of hazelnut’s propensity to cause several intestinal issues in your dog. It can also be a potential choking hazard. When it comes to dogs, it is best to stick to recommended foods from a qualified vet.", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}

{"id": "8951", "text": "- Job descriptions can be too vague, only focused on actions or results, not time-stamped, or have too many expectations.\n- A “scorecard” is a more effective tool for hiring and performance coaching, because it answers why, what, how, and by when.\n- The scorecard approach improves hiring success rates and enhances impact and enjoyment at work helping colleagues achieve meaningful results.\nLeaders make common mistakes with job descriptions when they are hiring and when they are reviewing performance. The consequence is an increased probability of making a hiring mistake or providing someone performance feedback that is useless or even irritating.\nThere are five mistakes that are entirely preventable.\nOne reason leaders make these mistakes is often because they do not want to be held accountable for a poor outcome. It is normal to want to avoid embarrassment. Or they have not done the hard thinking to examine cause-and-effect relationships between various actions and results. Or perhaps they are indecisive and unwilling to “put a line in the sand” and commit to a performance expectation out of fear that it will be judged to be too easy or too difficult to achieve.\nThe ghSMART CEO Genome research of more than 20,000 leaders suggests that “decisiveness” is a rare but desirable leadership behavior whose absence makes a team’s success much less likely. Deciding what is someone’s performance expectation is one of the most important ways in which a leader can show decisiveness, since the way to turn a “strategy” into “reality” is through coaching and guiding the behaviors and performance of teammates.\nMistake 1: Describing a Job in Vague Terms\n“Supporting the marketing team in promoting our products” is too vague. What does that mean? What level of performance is considered poor, good, or great? Watch out for “-ing” verb tenses—they are often too vague.\nInstead, consider a more specific statement of the job, such as “To help our customers modernize their inventory management systems by increasing sales of existing customers by 20 percent per year through new product introduction.” We would consider that an essential statement of the mission of the role, which is a high-level but specific explanation of why the job exists.\nMistake 2: Focusing Only on Actions, Not on Results\nSome leaders make the mistake of wording their expectations in terms of only actions, not results. “Contact at least 20 existing customers per week and conduct an account review with at least five per week.” That is a perfectly good expectation of an “input” or an “action,” but it is insufficient if all of the expectations are just actions, with no eye for the results they are expected to achieve. The risk is that people go through the motions of doing prescribed actions without feeling the urge to deliver a specific result. And your organization succeeds or fails based on results in key areas, not actions.\nMistake 3: Focusing Only on Results, Not on Actions\nOther leaders make the mistake of wording their expectations in terms of big-picture results, without regard to the actions that are likely to achieve them. “Grow revenue at least 15 percent per year” is a very specific “what.” But to make that expectation more achievable, it is helpful to also list several of the actions that are expected to achieve that result—the “how.”\nMistake 4: Not Saying When Something Is Expected to Be Completed\nSimilar to, and just as bad as, being vague (mistake #1) is not being time-bound in your performance expectations. “Support,” “Liaise,” “Communicate with,” “Manage,” or “Improve” somebody, a group, or a set of things with an unspecified time period is not easy to achieve. It is better to write “Create a business plan for the XYZ product group, to be approved or rejected by December 31 of this year.” Or “Hire 10 new consultants into the Latin America region by July 1 of next year.” Or “Raise $5m in new private funding within 2 years to complete the renovation of the community athletic center.”\nMistake 5: Having Too Many Expectations\nWhile doing research for our Power Score book, we examined the performance of more than 15,000 leaders and their teams. We discovered that only 24 percent of leaders are good at prioritizing. And when a leader is not good at prioritizing, 90 percent of the time it is because they have too many priorities, not too few. So when you are hiring somebody or are performance-coaching them, try not to have more than seven things you expect them to achieve. We have seen hiring or performance expectation documents from some leaders that list more than 50 expectations or success criteria. That is too many! People perform best when there are five to seven outcomes you expect at any given time.\nBringing It All Together\nA job description, by definition, merely describes a job, often in vague terms. You can’t “score” a job description for either a candidate you are considering hiring or a colleague whose performance you have the responsibility to evaluate and coach. Therefore, it is an insufficiently useful tool for hiring or performance coaching.\nIn contrast, we encourage colleagues and clients to follow a practice called writing a “scorecard.” A scorecard has a clear mission for the role. It identifies five to seven outcomes you expect a person to achieve by a certain date. The outcomes are a mixture of actions you want the person to take and the results you expect them to achieve. And you can easily “score” whether someone achieved the outcomes.\nYou may choose to add other bells and whistles to a scorecard, such as your company’s purpose and values. Perhaps that advice is for another article.\nUsing a scorecard, you will improve your ability as a leader to hire and performance-coach people to live the organization’s purpose and values and to take actions that achieve results. The why, what, how, and when are all important elements of a well-written scorecard. And once you shift from the vague and dull content of a job description to the sharp and powerful design of a scorecard, you will see your hiring success rate go up and your impact and enjoyment improve as you help your colleagues achieve meaningful results and career success.", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}
{"id": "8957", "text": "Social media has a language of its own, and being able to speak it fluently is critical to any business’s success today. From basic terms such as “comment” and “like” to the more complex “handle,” there is an endless number of terms to know.\nToday, I’ll go over some of the top terms you should know as a business owner or a social media marketer. I can’t cover all of them, because by the time I’m done writing this, no doubt there will be new terms to know, while others inch toward being obsolete. Your best bet is to be a regular consumer of all things social, so you’ll always know what’s trending and what’s on its way out.\nI’ve included the major platforms, all of which can be connected and managed within the Rallio app (our Instagram functionality is in its final development stages as of this writing). Watch for my next post where I’ll cover some of the other platforms, such as Pinterest, Snapchat and Tumblr.\nCommon General Terms Across Platforms\n- Comment: A response to your post from a reader. In most cases, comments appear below a post. On Twitter, however, comments appear in the form of a “reply” or a “retweet” and don’t all appear together as they would on Facebook or Instagram.\n- Follow/Followers: Click the “follow” button, and you’ll receive regular updates on that user or business in your feed. Once you subscribe to someone, that makes you that person’s follower! The more followers you have, of course, the better.\n- Handle: Your username, preceded by “@” and used on Twitter, Instagram and Snapchat. You can also type it on Facebook to tag a friend or a page in a post. Keep it consistent across platforms so people can find you easily.\n- Hashtag: A word or a phrase preceded by “#” with no spaces or unique characters. As I note in this post, you can use hashtags as conversation starters or search terms around topics of relevance to your brand. They’re primarily used on Twitter and Instagram.\n- Like: This feature appears differently depending on the platform. It’s simply a way for users to indicate they like your post. On Facebook, in addition to the “like” button, there’s a range of options on how users may choose to react to your post, including buttons for “love,” “haha” and “angry.” On Twitter and Instagram, there’s just a heart.\n- Mention/Tag: On Twitter, you can “mention” another user by placing an “@” before the username. Same thing on Instagram, though it’s commonly referred to as a “tag” rather than a mention. On Facebook, you would simply type the person’s name to tag that person. Whatever you call it, it’s a great way to thank your followers, call their attention to content of interest and attract new followers, too.\n- Newsfeed: The homepage of a platform where you’ll see a stream of updates from anyone you follow.\n- Post: Content that’s created by an account, including status updates, photos, videos and links. At the end of this section, you’ll see an example of a @rallioHQ Twitter post where we repurposed content from a previous blog post.\n- Profile: A user’s “homepage,” including descriptive information such as name, username, bio, occupation and any blogs or other websites, plus a photo of the user. It’s also a “command central” of sorts where users control privacy settings, account information and other details visible only to the user.\n— Rallio (@rallioHQ) March 27, 2017\n- Business Page: Separate from your personal Facebook profile, a business page is where you post photos, videos, links and events related to your brand. You will need a personal Facebook profile to have and operate a business page. It’s important to claim and create your business page so people have a place to engage with you and, if you have a physical location, to “check in” at your place of business (see “Check in” below). Go here for help creating your Facebook page, or drop us a line with any questions at email@example.com.\n- Check in: When posting, users can “check in” to a physical location using this button. It’s great for your business when users check in, because it alerts their friends about your business. Hello, free advertising!\n- Facebook Ads: Facebook allows business users to create ads promoting their pages, events, products and so forth. These ads are a cost-effective way to get your brand in front of more people and potentially increase sales. Here’s some help from Facebook in that department, and again, ask us at Rallio if you have any questions. We regularly help our clients set up and manage ad campaigns for their business pages.\n- Facebook Event: From your business page, you can create in-person and virtual “events” for your brand. They’re essentially like digital invitations. Say, for instance, you’re a yoga studio hosting a special prenatal yoga class. You can create an event from your page with the date, time and place, and then invite your followers and friends to the event/class.\n[bctt tweet=”#Facebook Events are essentially like digital invitations.” username=”rallioHQ”]\n- Facebook Live: If you’re hosting an event or just have an important update or message for your followers, you can broadcast live and connect with your followers in real time.\n- Facebook Stories: Accessible within the Facebook app, this new feature from Facebook allows users to share real-time updates within the span of 24 hours, featuring short video clips and photos. Unlike a typical Facebook post, stories disappear after 24 hours.\n- Share: This button appears beneath a post and allows users to share the content on their own pages for their followers to see. For example, clicking the “Share” button below provides users with the option to share the post in various places, such as on their own timeline or on a page they manage.\nPro Tip: Look at competition and challenges as invitations to build a stronger business.\n- Caption: A short description or comment about a photo or a video you’re posting. It includes hashtags and, in some cases, you may choose to tag other users’ handles.\n- Direct Message/DM: A private message between users that only those users can see. It goes into an inbox, accessible from your homepage in the app.\n- Filter: When creating posts, you can access various filters that allow you to change the appearance of photos, such as the lighting or coloring.\n- Live: Similar to Facebook Live, the Live feature on Instagram lets you broadcast real-time updates to your followers. Instagram will send out a notification to your followers that you’ve started a live video so they can log in and view it before it ends, making it a great way to capture your audience’s attention.\n[bctt tweet=”Go Live on #Instagram to capture your audience’s attention in real time. #socialmedia” username=”rallioHQ”]\n- Public/Private Account: Users may choose to make their profiles private or public. With a public account, anyone can follow the profile and view its photos and videos. If an account is private, users must request permission to follow the account before they can view any content.\n- Repost: A repost of someone else’s post on your Instagram page. You can use an app like Repost, or request permission to repost a user’s photo and then tag the user. See the example at the end of this section.\n- Boomerang: A video app to turn regular videos into gif-like looping videos, capturing a moment in time and then playing it over and over again. The feature is built in as an option within Instagram’s Stories feature, described below. It works great for action shots. Here’s more on Boomerang, but give it a try yourself. You have to see it to understand how fun it is!\n- Sponsored Content: Content with paid advertising dollars behind it. Again, a great way to extend your reach.\n- Stories: As with Facebook Stories, Instagram Stories let you build a “story” over 24 hours with photos and videos.\n- Company Page: Here’s where you create an overview of your business and share articles, photos and updates. Your updates show up in followers’ news feeds.\n- Showcase Page: An extension of your Company Page where you can spotlight your brand, a business unit or an initiative. You can then share the Showcase Page content with a targeted audience and build engagement with like-minded LinkedIn members.\n- Connections: The people with whom you are connected on LinkedIn. Connections are like your “friends” on Facebook, and you have to request to be connected with a user (known as an “invitation,” below).\n- Groups: Groups are created either by a person or by a company around a specific topic or industry. Once you’ve created a company page, you can join various groups and interact with other users to build more connections.\n- Invitation: An invitation is simply a request to connect with someone on LinkedIn.\n- My Network: Click this tab at the top of your LinkedIn homepage to view your connections, invitations and people you may know. You can also have your email address book imported to see additional suggested users with whom to connect.\n- Tweet: The 140-characters-or-less post you create on Twitter. It’s also used as a verb, as in, “I like to tweet out a new promotion every couple of weeks.”\n- Character Count: Twitter is known for limiting its posts to 140 characters. That means whatever you have to say needs to be short and sweet.\n- Direct Message/DM: Messages communicated between users directly within the app. Users can set up their privacy controls either to receive direct messages from anyone, or only from those they follow.\n- Moments: Curated stories that showcase the best, most relevant posts around a trending topic. Click the Moments tab to discover what’s happening on Twitter or to create a Moment of your own.\n- Retweet/RT: Clicking this button allows users to share another user’s post with their own followers. The more people retweet your content, the greater your reach and potential for new followers. In addition to retweeting other users’ content, you can ask for retweets on your content, too. Pair it with a contest or a giveaway as an added incentive. See the example at the end of this section.\n- Trends: From the homepage on Twitter, look in the lefthand column, and you’ll see a list of trending hashtags and topics. Click on any of them to say what people are saying, and then jump in and like, retweet, or create tweets of your own where you include the trend. Be sure you understand the context of the trend so you can be on point with your tweets.\nThe first pitch of 2017!\nGive this a RT and we'll pick someone at random to win a voucher for two Phillies tickets! pic.twitter.com/cQ8J2cNjUP\n— NBC Sports Philadelphia (@NBCSPhilly) April 3, 2017\nPhew, that was a lot of terminology to get through, and I have only just scratched the surface here.

{"id": "9022", "text": "Blockchain technology is evolving at a rapid speed. It is disrupting businesses across industries. Be it automotive, healthcare, fintech, customer goods, or logistics — the impact of decentralization is substantial. In 2021, where companies are restricted to work with limited resources and workforce, blockchain acts as a catalyst.\nIn today's digital transformation era and quick online adaptation, it has become inevitable for business owners to prepare themselves for the future. The COVID-19 has brought a massive change in the consumers' behavior of interacting with online services and products. To take the lead and drive more revenue, entrepreneurs and even small business owners need to adopt advanced technologies to streamline their businesses.\nRegardless of the organization's size, owners can operate their business more efficiently and in a cost-optimized manner using blockchain. On this note, check out why businesses should adopt decentralized solutions to grow exponentially in 2021.\nBlockchain is faster & accurate\nIn 2021 and beyond, businesses need higher speed to execute their complex processes, and traditional methods are not capable. Be it supply chain management, inventory management, or processes customers' data for gathering information — speed plays a vital role.\nAs blockchain is a peer-to-peer network and is fully encrypted, it offers faster speed and accuracy in every internal or customer-linked operation. Instead of leveraging the older centralized database, companies can migrate to a cloud-based blockchain database to accelerate their management.\nIn several processes, blockchain eliminates the need for intermediaries or third-party tools, making management much hassle-free. With the use of smart contracts, many manual tasks become easy to automate with higher accuracy.\nEvery internal and external business process needs to be secured and encrypted to keep everyone's day safe and intact. Implementing robust security protocols is tedious and time-consuming with conventional technology implementations. On the other side, blockchain saves a lot of time for owners as it is a top-notch secured technology that is easy to integrate.\nBy leveraging blockchain-based databases, smart contracts, and NFTs not only improves security but also help in gaining higher customer trust. In this fast-paced digitized ecosystem, having a 360° security helps you scale your organization with higher stability. Not only fintech and insurance industries, but the need for better security solutions is overgrowing in all domains.\nBe it an eCommerce shop, a service company, or a digital product firm, owners need to make sure the data is secure, accessible, and distributed. SevenBits can help companies to transform their legacy systems into a modern advancement.\nIn 2021 and even beyond, businesses need to operate efficiently at lower resources and finances. Blockchain technology helps organizations operating in a cost-efficient manner with improved security. Be it automating bulk manual operations or scaling the business in different locations, the convenience with blockchain is superior.\nWith the evolution of NFT (Non-fungible tokens), the entire concept of storing, identifying, and processing original information has become seamless. The NFT technology can help company owners in multiple ways to boost their business' authenticity and trust. As blockchain is an open-source technology, customizing it as per business' bespoke requirements is faster and seamless.\nBusiness frauds elimination\nAs a business grows by utilizing digital advancements, the chances of business frauds and finance swindles also increase. With a long partnership chain, complex supply chain connectivity, and growing processes, it becomes complex to detect and prevent frauds.\nHowever, blockchain is the complete solution to quickly prevent fraudulent activities and detect any unexpected activity in the system. As it enhances transparency in the existing business model, there is no scope for data manipulation or unauthorized monitoring. For keeping business and customers' data safe and intact, blockchain is the primary solution.\nGet started with Seven Bits' Blockchain Development Services\nSeven Bits is a leading blockchain development company that caters to multiple industries.

{"id": "9075", "text": "On his first night in a new apartment after two years of homelessness, Mike Eagle Tail found himself bolting awake in his bed, expecting to hear the wail of police sirens or the sound of people crying out for help.\nInstead, for the first time in months, Eagle Tail heard only his three sleeping children — Raymond, 9, Rolanda, 8 and Lakota, 7 — breathing softly from their bedrooms. Eagle Tail quietly eased his bulky frame through the apartment, checking on his children.\n\"It was surreal how calm it was,\" said Eagle Tail, 40. \"You can't fully appreciate how precious shelter is until it's gone.\"\nAn unprecedented, six-week effort to find stable housing for hundreds of people living at a crowded homeless encampment near the Little Earth housing project in south Minneapolis is finally showing significant results. The Eagle Tails are among nearly three dozen people, including individuals and families, who have moved out of the camp and into apartments or homes after months or even years living on the streets. Another 75 people have been screened and matched with community housing programs, often the final step before moving into permanent housing.\nWhile slower than some anticipated, the gains still mark a turning point in a highly coordinated campaign to bring social services to this sprawling tent city, which remains the temporary home of about 200 men, women and children.\nSince August, city, county and American Indian officials have treated the camp as a public health emergency and have marshaled teams of social workers to talk to the residents and sign them up for housing. The leaders of Red Lake Nation, whose members represent about one-quarter of the camp population, have also launched an aggressive effort to recruit willing landlords and remove barriers such as rules that bar people with prior evictions or criminal records. At the same time, outreach workers with local nonprofits have been ferrying people to and from appointments with landlords, while also helping them apply for state housing assistance.\nIt generally takes up to two months for someone who is homeless to move into housing after being referred to a community provider, county officials said.\nBecause of the aggressive outreach efforts, some of the most vulnerable of the tent city's inhabitants, including people with disabilities and families with children, are moving into apartments within weeks after engaging with social workers.\n\"We've never had this concentration [of homeless], so any response was going to be greater in scale than anything we've seen previously,\" said David Hewitt, director of the Hennepin County Office to End Homelessness. Now, after a six-week push, he said, \"We are starting to see more and more people cross that finish line.\"\nFor many still living at the camp, progress has seemed painfully slow. In interviews, people living at the camp describe the frustration of waiting weeks for a spot to open in a community housing program only to learn that landlords had turned down their applications because of problems with their credit or rental histories.\nAnd in some cases, camp inhabitants have turned down subsidized housing because they simply were not ready to leave relatives behind or make such a dramatic shift in lifestyle, outreach workers said.\nEven with the recent housing successes, the population of the camp has hardly diminished, because new people move in each day to replace those who leave.\nWith cold weather approaching, the Minneapolis City Council recently passed an emergency measure intended to speed up the planned relocation of those at the camp to a nearby site owned by the Red Lake Nation.\nThe band plans to erect a series of connected trailers at the site, just a few blocks east of the camp, to shelter up to 150 people. Demolition began this week at the site, which tribal leaders expect to be ready by early December.\n\"Why are our elders still here? Why are children still here? Why are there still people here in wheelchairs?\" asked a frustrated James Cross, founder of the street outreach group Natives Against Heroin, which has an army of volunteers that provide security and donations at the site. \"You can't call this progress when you've got this many people stuck out here.\"\nYet for many at the camp, moving inside no longer seems like a far-off scenario.\nLast week, Caryn Pacheco, 56, took her first tour of a vacant apartment since she moved into the encampment in late July.\nShe said she was surprised when a social worker who accompanied her on the visit politely asked her what she was looking for in an apartment. \"I said, 'Well, indoor plumbing would be nice!' \" Pacheco said, chuckling as she ate a bowl of soup outside her tent. \"Four walls. Heat. A toilet. … The bar is low when you've been living out here.\"\nWhile the apartment did not pan out, Pacheco said she has started to feel hopeful for the first time in months.\n\"I can visualize it now — you know, me decorating a place,\" she said. \"I'd make it very Bohemian.\"\nOn Monday, Mike and Ellen Rose Eagle Tail and their three children became the first tenants of a south Minneapolis fourplex that was hastily converted into housing for American Indian men and women living at the camp.\nTheir life, however, remains much as it was before they found the apartment.\nIn August, the Eagle Tails became members of Natives Against Heroin (NAH) and highly visible volunteers at the encampment, working 70-hour weeks to protect others. Mike, whose nickname is \"Big Mike,\" regularly patrolled the camp at night, sometimes putting his own life in danger to break up fights and rescue people who had overdosed on heroin. They have continued to do this work, day after day, even after moving into a place of their own. \"It brings a smile to my face to be out here,\" Ellen said on a recent evening.\nWhen an older woman at the camp was assaulted this week, causing fear to ripple through the tent community, the Eagle Tails immediately agreed to spend another night providing security. It meant another night of fitful sleep on the hard, sloping ground along Hiawatha Avenue, which shakes with each passing truck. On such nights, the Eagle Tails drop their children off at their grandmother's house nearby and then wake before dawn to prepare them for school.\n\"I felt so much guilt and so much rage [after the assault] that I had to come back,\" Mike said, as he helped unload a fresh delivery of donations to the NAH tent. \"This camp and these people have become a part of us. It's all about the relatives.\"\nWhen not at the camp, the Eagle Tails begin their mornings exactly as they always have — by honoring their traditions.\nOn a weekday morning, they burned sprigs of sage while Ellen carefully braided the long dark hair of her husband and children. The children, who take indigenous drumming classes, then gathered in a circle and began pounding their deerhide drums while singing songs in Ojibwe. When the drumming stopped, the children looked refreshed and ready for school.\nMoments before they walked out the door, Mike took one final peek at their rooms and calmly encouraged Lakota to tidy up his bed. \"We're going to respect this home,\" he said without scolding. \"Because there are some people who don't have a home.\"\nChris Serres • 612-673-4308 Twitter: @chrisserres", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}

{"id": "9167", "text": "Chimneys are a vital component of any home with a fireplace or wood-burning stove. They provide ventilation, allowing smoke and harmful gasses to escape while keeping the indoor air clean and safe. However, chimneys can develop various issues over time that may compromise their functionality and pose risks to your home and family. One of the most effective ways to prevent chimney problems is through regular chimney inspections. At Town & Country, we’ve been providing our customers with chimney inspection services for years and wanted to talk about why it’s a good idea to have one performed.\nThe Importance of Regular Chimney Inspections\nRegular chimney inspections are crucial for maintaining the safety and efficiency of your chimney system. Over time, soot, creosote, and debris can accumulate in the chimney flue, which can restrict airflow and increase the risk of chimney fires. Additionally, chimneys may experience damage due to weather conditions, such as cracking or crumbling masonry, which can lead to structural issues. By scheduling routine chimney inspections, you can identify and address these problems early on, preventing them from escalating into larger, more expensive issues.\nDetecting Hidden Chimney Issues\nNot all chimney problems are visible to the untrained eye. Some issues may be concealed within the chimney structure, making them difficult to spot without a thorough inspection. For example, chimney liners play a vital role in protecting the chimney walls from heat and corrosion. Over time, liners can deteriorate or become damaged, posing a serious risk of fire or carbon monoxide leaks. A professional chimney inspection can uncover these hidden problems, allowing for prompt repairs or replacements.\nPreventing Carbon Monoxide\nCarbon monoxide (CO) is an odorless, colorless gas that can be lethal if it accumulates in your home. Improperly functioning chimneys can be a significant source of carbon monoxide leaks. Cracks, gaps, or blockages in the chimney can lead to the backflow of this toxic gas into your living spaces. By scheduling regular chimney inspections, you can ensure that your chimney is properly venting harmful gasses, reducing the risk of carbon monoxide poisoning.\nExtending Chimney Lifespan\nA well-maintained chimney can last for many years, providing warmth and comfort to your home. Regular chimney inspections can help identify minor issues before they cause significant damage. By addressing these problems early on, you can extend the lifespan of your chimney and avoid costly repairs or even complete chimney rebuilds.\nCompliance with Safety Standards and Insurance Requirements\nMany insurance policies require homeowners to maintain their chimneys properly. By regularly scheduling chimney inspections and keeping a record of the inspections and any necessary repairs, you can demonstrate your compliance with safety standards and insurance requirements. This not only ensures the safety of your home and family but also protects you from potential disputes with insurance companies in case of chimney-related incidents.\nWork With an Experienced Maryland Chimney Inspection Company\nChimney inspections are essential for preventing chimney issues and maintaining a safe and efficient chimney system. Don’t wait until a problem arises—schedule a professional chimney inspection today and enjoy peace of mind knowing that your chimney is in optimal condition. You can reach us at Town & Country at (410-995-6700) or send us a message online.", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}

Currently, Coursera is offering free courses based on content marketing, marketing analytics, business models, financial planning and more.\nCompleting the Foster Excel Business Course\nWe all see it on our Canvas dashboards––but with classes, jobs, and other obligations, is there ever really time to actually complete it? With the stay-at-home order and quarantine carrying over to the summer, it is the perfect opportunity to complete this course!\nThese are our favorites and personal recommendations, but if you are a Foster student, here is a comprehensive canvas page of resources: COVID Career\nRemember––it's your summer!\nWhile there are many resources available to help in developing your professional and academic careers over the summer, it is important to remember that despite all this, we are still in a global pandemic; use this time at home to relax and refocus! Although it is important to stay productive, productivity should never be something you guilt yourself in doing, but a goal you want to achieve. Productivity should be based solely on how you operate based on your own limits and goals.\nNo matter how you choose to spend your summer, remember to take things at your own pace and do what is best for your physical and mental health.

{"id": "9236", "text": "I'm adding my voice to the clamor\n- Because our new administration has, at best, contradictory views on climate change and science\n- Because 80% of scientists say that the general public’s lack of understanding about the nature of science contributes to the controversy surrounding climate change\n- Because moderate views are endangered in politics and lots of other places including climate science and reporting\nI hope you'll stick with this even though it's long. Sound bytes can sometimes do us an incredible disservice, and there are no shortcuts out of here. I’d go so far as to say one reason we’re in this pickle is because we’re overly enamored of shortcuts.\nThis is a prismatic overview of how and why science works, how facts transform into \"alternatives,\" and the science of climate change. I’ll split each into its composite parts so we can study the paths and chase down origins and, of course, fact.\nOrigins matter. When you can’t divide something any further, its nature is revealed and we stand at the feet of truth.\n*|| CHOOSING SIDES ||*\nRegardless of what side you’re on in any given argument, you should be alarmed by partisan facts.\nThrough some freaky cultural alchemy, we (and our candidates and news sources) are now able to point at a square and say, “nope, that’s a strawberry,” and no amount of hard evidence presented to counter is sufficient to draw out a retraction.\nI feel comfortable defining that as a literal act of insanity.\nWe need to make facts bipartisan again, and I’m going to start here with science and eventually move into climate change, because its important and validity has recently come up.\n*|| DEFINING FACT AND SCIENCE ||*\nA fact is something that has existence, is objective and immutable; in short, it’s the truth. The “objective” part is particularly important.\nSCIENTIFIC PROCESSES ARE HOW WE DISCOVER FACTS. Your 8th grade textbook defines science as the process of observation, explanation, reasoning, testing, and predicting, to discover fact. It sounds like such a clean process, moving linearly from question to conclusion, full stop.\nReal-world science is rarely linear, and it’s riddled with uncertainty because the world is an incredibly complicated place. Every new piece of understanding we unearth shines more light on all the things we don’t know—which is not something to fear! Uncertainty is a huge reason why good scientists will always account for the fact that there’s more to learn. Admitting uncertainty doesn’t undermine the validity of discovery; it’s proof of responsibility, because hubris is the enemy of impartiality and inquiry.\nFacts must be impartial.\nThat’s why you’ll almost never get a scientist to say that they’re “100% certain” about anything, and I believe that stance can mystify people who aren’t scientists. From the outside looking in, seeing experts who “aren’t sure” about something big and important like our world changing is really frightening. They’re the experts! If they don’t know, then who does…?\nThe truth is, scientists usually know more than anyone else, but it may not look like that to non-scientists. Also, a lot of scientists are genuinely awful at talking about what they do.\nSo yes, we must acknowledge that the discovery of facts comes from an imperfect system, but it’s the best system and scientific processes (Observation! Testing! Retesting! Data series!) are designed to account for and minimize our fallibility.\n*|| MODELS ||*\nIn order to be very certain of something and get over that fallibility hump, science needs a lot of time for tons of information to be collected, which can suck because we usually need to make a decision about what to do right now. Our problems aren’t going to wait fifty years while we collect a really robust data set. It’s go time.\nThat’s where models come in. A scientific model is in some ways similar to a model plane: it’s a fraction of the size and it tries to capture as many of the real-life details as possible. Scientific models are a representation of a real-life process that's difficult to study because it’s so large (like ocean currents) or it happens over a long time scale. There are many kinds of models, but in this case, I'm talking about predictive models, which rely on data from past events to create predictions for the future. Scientists take the data from years of measurements and build an equation that explain those data, while ALSO including math that helps capture more recent changes.\nThen, they use the equation to predict how events will turn out in the future. Models usually give you a range of possibilities, like a weather report.\nModels are like the Cliff Notes version of science; they give you a general idea of what’s happening, but if you’re writing a final paper worth 50% of your grade, you can’t rely on Cliff Notes. It’s the same thing with predictive models. They’re useful when time is short, but to generate quick answers, models can end up sacrificing accuracy.\nWhen a layperson or newscaster or politician sees a model, it’s easy to assume that’s what’s going to happen or choose one extreme end of the model, because extremes are interesting and newsworthy. But, if a certain scenario doesn’t happen, well, people become more distrustful of science. Scientists hate creating fifty year predictions because it’s pretty darn likely that the model will be wrong in some significant way. Unfortunately, decision makers and money allocators and policy implementers need to know whether to worry about it right this very minute, or can we put it off for a while?\nI’m making this whole “science” thing sound really terrible, aren’t I? Like it’s this wishy-washy process where the only results are men in white coats cashing grant checks and going ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯\nIt’s not, though. It’s one of the most powerful processes in the universe, and it’s helped us tremendously as a species. I can say with full confidence that science is also going to be responsible for a huge portion of any future successes we have.\nI’m breaking this down so non-scientists understand the strengths and weaknesses of the scientific process so we all have a basic understand of the results of science. I don’t think the solution to facts becoming partisan is to put blind faith in experts; I think the answer is for all us to become scientists: to embrace skepticism, give up cynicism, and to always ask questions.\n*|| COMING SOON: FACT DRIFT ||*\nPart II will focus on how facts get bent out of shape, and what kind of effect that has on science and policy.", "scores": {"score": 3, "score_transform_1": 5, "score_transform_2": 5, "score_transform_3": 0}}

{"id": "9258", "text": "Biden Banks On South Carolina To Reenergize His Campaign\nMICHEL MARTIN, HOST:\nBroadcasting today from South Carolina Public Radio in Columbia. The polls are still open at this hour in South Carolina as voters cast their ballots in the Democratic presidential primary. There are 54 delegates at stake. And just as important, this is a critical test for former Vice President Joe Biden, who hopes to reenergize his campaign for the Democratic nomination with a big win today. Joining me here in the studios of South Carolina Public Radio is NPR senior editor and correspondent Ron Elving.\nRon, good to see you.\nRON ELVING, BYLINE: Good to be with you, Michel.\nMARTIN: Also with us is Scott Hoffman, professor of political science at Winthrop University in Rock Hill, S.C. He also directs the Winthrop Poll, which regularly surveys political opinion in the state.\nWelcome, professor Hoffman. Good to see you in person.\nSCOTT HOFFMAN: Happy to be here.\nMARTIN: All right, Ron. Let me start with you. Senator Bernie Sanders got to the primary here in South Carolina as the Democratic front-runner with all the momentum. Can Biden slow him down with a win here?\nHOFFMAN: That's certainly what the Biden people are hoping. They're hoping that by having a big showing tonight that they can restore the momentum that's largely been lost out of their campaign. But because there's been an expectation that Biden would win here - this has been his firewall all along - that win would have to be substantial to really do him very much good. And if it is not, people are going to question whether or not Biden really got much out of the state.\nAnd let's think of the unthinkable for the Bidens. If he loses here tonight, it's very hard to see how he can restore his campaign next week on Super Tuesday.\nMARTIN: And, professor Hoffman, you've been following the ups and downs of the campaign here in South Carolina for a long time - really all campaigns for quite some time here. So former Vice President Biden has long been seen as kind of a dominant front-runner here, but his lead started slipping in recent days. So who is most in need of a good showing in South Carolina after Biden?\nHOFFMAN: Well, you know, Bernie Sanders, you know, had what - 20-some percent of the vote last time around? He just got roundly spanked by Hillary Clinton. And that's because most of his vote was from the more liberal whites. What Bernie Sanders needs to do is show that he can actually get the votes of people of color, of African Americans - core part of the Democratic Party nationally. If he continues to win simply with liberal whites, he's not going to be seen as viable.\nAnd one thing I'm looking for is Tom Steyer. He was a wholly unknown person - spent millions - I think $23 million in South Carolina. You can't - if you have an IP address from South Carolina, you can't get on YouTube, you can't do anything without seeing Tom Steyer's face. And I think a lot of people were looking for a moderate other than Biden, and so he has benefited. But, of course, the thing that shook up everything this week was the endorsement by Jim Clyburn.\nMARTIN: OK. Ron, anything you want to add?\nELVING: Well, Jim Clyburn, of course, endorsed Biden. And that really did kind of put the halo back on Biden here in the state that had been knocked off by his poor showing in the first three events.\nAt the same time, Steyer has really gone directly at the black community. He has seen that as his best opportunity to get votes. And people have been talking about 55, 60, 65% of the vote being cast by African Americans. And he has ferociously courted them this week, not only with media but with public appearances. His family's been out and about. He's had really a lot of contact with young, black voters in the university community. So Tom Steyer could eat deeply into Biden's showing, even despite the Clyburn endorsement.\nMARTIN: And we're going to hear more about that later in the program - of the fact that Tom Steyer has been such a presence in the state - and, as you pointed out, not just with the ads.\nOK. So, Professor Hoffman, I'm sure you're looking at the exit polls tonight. Are there any particular groups that you're going to be paying particular attention to this evening? You know, obviously, you know, we've all talked about the fact that many campaigns have been working to court African American voters here in South Carolina but other groups as well. Who else are you looking at?\nHOFFMAN: Yeah. So, you know, it's race, it's sex but it's also age. Last time around, 61% of the electorate was African American. Almost two-thirds were women. Black women are the crown jewel of the South Carolina Democratic presidential primary.\nBarack Obama had an amazing campaign going after them and winning them. Elizabeth Warren took a really good strategy and tried and failed at that. Tom Steyer has been reaching out. But the other thing is age. You know, 18 to 24 was in the low single digits before. We look at 18 to 29, it still wasn't that high. So if we see a large number of younger people, it'll make a difference.\nMARTIN: OK. More on that later this hour. NPR senior editor and correspondent Ron Elving is with us. Also Scott Huffman, professor of political science at Winthrop University here in South Carolina.

{"id": "9276", "text": "A safety audit systematically assesses an organization's safety performance and practices. It is not just an inspection but also includes evaluating an organization’s policies, procedures, and practices to identify any associated risks. A safety audit helps organizations improve their existing systems to reduce workplace accidents or injuries.\nThe purpose of conducting a safety audit is to ensure compliance with occupational health and safety standards as well as legislative requirements. In addition, it helps organizations identify opportunities for improvements in reducing risk factors related to health conditions, such as stress levels among workers due to poor working conditions, etc.\nTransform your cleaning routine with our step-by-step guide! 🚿🧹 Dive into creating a bathroom cleaning checklist for a pristine and germ-free environment. Elevate your hygiene standards by following our expert tips in our latest blog: Step-by-Step Guide: Creating a Bathroom Cleaning Checklist for a Pristine and Germ-Free Environment. Your guide to a sparkling, bacteria-free bathroom awaits! ✨🛁\nWhen it comes to workplace safety and compliance, you need to start with a safety audit. Conducting a safety audit at your facility can help identify potential hazards before they become an issue for your employees and customers alike. However, it can be challenging for employers who need help figuring out where, when, or how to start the process.\nNumerous variables can influence a safety audit form's steps. Still, the principles given below are universally valid and relevant to safety audits regardless of the industry:\nA checklist must include several questions that can be used as-is or customized for your particular needs and use cases. You can also create your own custom templates by adding questions from our library of free templates or using our tool to generate a new question each time you need it—no coding required.\nThe Zorp Safety Audit Checklist template is a great starting point for your audit. It provides you with a framework to assess any workplace’s safety practices. You can customize it for your unique use cases.\nHaving a safety audit procedure that is compliant is more important than having a good safety audit procedure. If you wish to distribute your safety audit procedure template or checklist to your auditors, take care to ensure that it contains the necessary checking points to ensure compliance with your business' safety audit standards before distributing it.\nIn order for safety officers at businesses to be able to create audit templates that include all of the necessary checks and inspections for compliance, they must be aware of applicable OSHA Laws and Regulations.\nSafety audits should be scheduled in advance and conducted by someone capable of reviewing the issues identified. If you schedule your safety audits in advance, it gives you time to prepare for them. You can also plan ahead so that you are not rushed while conducting the audit and miss something important.\nYou can help yourself conduct a successful safety audit by setting up checklists that you follow when conducting an audit. These checklists will ensure that no area or issue is overlooked during the audit process. When setting up these lists, make sure that they cover all aspects of safety management. It will help ensure that everything gets noticed during an inspection or risk assessment report preparation process.\nYou should be documenting the hazards in the audit and suggesting solutions to mitigate them. Documenting the action plan for each hazard would also be a good idea. You should document the date and time of your safety audit, as well as all team members who participated in it. Lastly, you should record all outcomes from this safety audit so that you can use it as a reference tool in future audits if necessary.\nThe next step is to implement your action plan. You should review the safety audit results with team members and discuss how they can be implemented. You should also document how you will monitor the implementation of each action plan to ensure that everyone on your team is following it.\nMaintaining a safe and secure environment for the data and records is important once the safety audit has been completed. The purpose of this policy is to ensure the privacy of your employees. It’ll also help protect your business in case of a lawsuit is filed against it.\nIf you are looking for a way to keep your company's safety audit records and data secure, cloud-based software is the best option. Having your data secured on a cloud gives you the peace of mind that it is protected and easily accessible from anywhere in the world.\nA Health and Safety audit checklist should include detailed and comprehensive information. In contrast to a preventative maintenance checklist, which defines the actions that a technician must carry out during a maintenance inspection, a safety checklist should contain all the essential components of a building or place of business that need to be regularly checked.\nIt is imperative that a safety audit checklist includes not only the identified risks but also their severity, likelihood, and potential impact level, to ensure that they are completely accurate.\nSafety audits can be performed by anyone from auditors to consultants to managers, employees, and inspectors. Contractors are another group that performs safety audits, as well as other professionals who may not have a direct connection with the company's operation but help create a safer environment for their workers.\nOthers can also perform safety audits if they are authorized to do so based on their experience and credentials. For example, insurance companies have been known to approve certain individuals or entities as “safety audit specialists” who can conduct such reviews on behalf of an insurance carrier in order to determine whether an employee or contractor has met certain requirements regarding their operation's health and safety policies in general terms.\nThe benefits are obvious when you're using a mobile app for safety audits. It's easier to use than paper and more accurate than online forms because it doesn't require typing. The data can be stored on the app and shared with multiple users, which is convenient if you have teams working on different aspects of an audit at the same time. It also offers templates that help prevent mistakes in collecting information about a facility or process.\nThe best part about using a mobile app for safety audits is that anyone can do it, including those who don't have computer access.\nPerforming a safety audit using a mobile app has several merits over traditional procedures. In fact, it’s the future way of doing safety audits that businesses have started to adopt. The Zorp safety audit template is an excellent resource for any business or organization looking to improve workplace safety. It’s a simple, straightforward tool that can be customized to fit your needs, helping you identify potential hazards and ensure you meet OSHA regulations.

Northern Ireland’s experience is not unique – across Europe communities are witnessing the normalisation of hate with openly extremist parties getting elected to government, and a relatively small number of extremists in the Republic of Ireland causing disruption, polarisation and violence in already marginalised communities across the state.\nEvidence shows when communities and organisations are prepared for such disruption, its impact significantly reduces. Now is the time to consider how we can work together to disrupt extremists and prevent the harm hate groups could do in our already traditionally divided society.\nIn this upcoming event we will discuss practical examples of how communities have come together at short notice to respond when hate groups have targeted their communities, and hear from participants views on how these examples can be used or adapted in the context of Northern Ireland. This event also aims to facilitate the networking and relationship building which is key to responding effectively to hate, and so is targeted at participants from Derry and the North West.\nParticipants will leave with a toolkit of materials to take away as a resource.", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}

Our goal is to get your statue to you without damage; therefore, extra attention must be paid to packaging and shipping of statuary not ordinarily found in shipping of other goods.\nShipping statues is a serious task and we ask for your understanding concerning the cost of this important service. Size, weight, fragility and care in packaging all have to be carefully considered in order to get a treasured work of art to you safely, and efficiently. Many of our offerings come to you directly from the warehouses or statuaries, minimizing the handling and risk for damage. Our goal is to get your statue to you without damage; therefore, extra attention must be paid to packaging and shipping of statuary not ordinarily found in shipping of other goods.\nWe use surplus boxes when available to help reduce your overall shipping costs. We may also double box an item to ensure it's safe delivery. Depending on size and weight, items are shipped via UPS Standard Ground service, Fed-Ex Standard Ground service, United States Postal Service or common freight carrier for heavy or large items. Shipping prices are subject to change without notice.\nMany statues and fountains are made to order and not inventoried. Please allow 3 to 6 weeks for delivery of your made to order items. Some items require longer production times, more intricate packaging, and just take longer to ship. You will be informed of any such circumstances if and when they arise. In cases where an item is \"in stock\", we will normally ship within a few days. Some special orders may take up to 6 months to arrive from overseas.\nPlease note, due to unprecedented demand and shipping delays there will be a greater lead time for shipping certain pieces, especially cast stone and made to order statues and fountains.\nDue to the size and weight of large or heavy items they must be sent via freight carrier. Here are a few special things to note about freight deliveries:\n• The trucking company will contact you 1-2 days before delivery to schedule a delivery time.\n• You must be there to sign for the delivery and inspect the item for any damage. The trucking company will not just drop it off.\n• The item(s) will be delivered curbside to your home. The delivery company will not take the product onto your property or into your home. Therefore you may need to get assistance in moving the item. You may want to contact a local landscapers or contractor to help you with this.\n• Please be aware that you cannot refuse delivery unless you notice damage. If you refuse delivery for any other reason, you will be responsible for all return shipping or re-delivery charges.\n• If a eighteen wheeler can not go down your street a Pup Truck must be requested or additional charges will be incurred.\nPlease note that if there is an address change after the shipping label has been created there will often be a re-consignment fee incurred.\nAn additional re-consignment fee or a change of address fee may be incurred if the ship to address needs to be modified for any reason after the item has been picked up by shipping company.\nExpedited shipping is available for some in-stock items. Expedited shipping typically increases the shipping cost by a large amount. Due to the many variables in determining the expedited shipping cost we cannot determine the additional carrier fees until the product packaged and made ready to ship. We can work with you to set a budgeted amount for the carrier; if this budget is exceeded we will contact you for further instructions. In many cases our normal shipping practices are sufficient to meet your needs.\nAll shipping prices are for the shipping within the Continental United States.

{"id": "9305", "text": "A couple of important events to note this coming week.\nFirst, the personnel of Edmonton Catholic Schools will gather on Tuesday for their annual faith development day. About 3000 people - trustees, administration, teachers, support staff - will assemble to celebrate the Eucharist and reflect together upon the gift of faith. Not a bad idea, that. Faith in Jesus Christ is the heart of our Catholic school system. It is also the heart and fuel of every Christian life. What ECS is doing is a sign of what must occupy all Christians at all times: the development of the faith.\nReflecting upon the upcoming Year of Faith to which he is summoning the Church, Pope Benedict, in an address last Friday to the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, stated that the renewal of faith must be the first priority of the Church in our day. This Year, he said, is \"an opportune moment to point out to all the gift of faith in the Risen Christ, the clear teaching of the Second Vatican Council and the invaluable doctrinal synthesis offered by the Catechism of the Catholic Church.\"\nFaith in the Risen Christ means: acceptance that Jesus is who he says he is, trusting in his fidelity to us and in the life-giving power of his Resurrection, believing that he is with us as he promised. In short, faith is believing in the love of God for us (cf. 1John 4:16). Such faith in the person of Christ leads naturally to full acceptance of his message. The Lord's teaching has been handed on in the Tradition of the Church. Hence the need to pay special attention to the great signposts of that Tradition. Pope Benedict is highlighting in particular the teaching of the Second Vatican Council and the Catechism of the Catholic Church.\nDeveloping the faith means growing in our knowledge and love of Christ and surrendering ever more fully to his message. May there be, indeed, a profound renewal of faith throughout the Church.\nThe second event will take place on Thursday, the Feast of the Presentation of the Lord. This is also the World Day for Consecrated Life. Its purpose is to focus our attention and esteem on the great witness of consecrated life in the Church and world, as well as to offer men and women in religious life the opportunity to renew their commitment to the evangelical counsels. I have known many wonderful sisters and priests in religious orders and have been moved by their example. Think of the priests and sisters who have touched your lives and offer a prayer of thanks to God for their witness. May the Lord of the harvest bless the Church with an abundance of consecrated and holy women and men, whose witness will inspire many to faith in Christ.", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}

{"id": "9327", "text": "Are you social distancing? For most of us, self-isolation is like the whiplash you experience after an unexpected, abrupt halt cruising at 70 miles per hour. These are unprecedented times; the notion of staying at home for an extended period is a lot for anyone to wrap their head around, both physically and mentally. And the present situation, in particular, means we have a lot of unexpected, newfound time on our hands to utilise.\nSo whether you are self-isolating, or practising social distancing, there’s a world to explore from your armchair to help prevent cabin fever and keep your mind and body active. Instead of glueing yourselves to the TV, why not explore some of the free opportunities to keep yourself entertained indoors while you’re stuck at home. When it comes to learning new skills and bettering yourself, there really is no time like the present. What about starting to learn a language, studying a free university paper, or doing cool things with the kids? Keeping up connection is important, too, and supporting our friends, colleagues and loved ones is the single best way we can show our care.\nStaying in can be just as fun and productive as going out - Instead of sulking in boredom, here are six things you can be getting on with while you’re stuck indoors.\nREAD A BOOK\nImage Credit (left to right) - Pinterest\nMore downtime inside = more time to read. Stock up on books and engage your brain in something other than Netflix for a change. If you, like me, have a list of books as long as your arm you want to get through this year (or even just in your lifetime), make the most of your time at home and get working through those titles.\nTry the book-a-week challenge and then get together on FaceTime with a group of friends to discuss it. Set a target to read a certain amount of pages every single day and engrain it in your daily routine to help reduce your screen time. Or, if you have a list of classics you've been meaning to get through, now's the time.\nGET YOUR DIY ON\nImage Credit (left to right) - The Every Girl, Camille Styles\nIt’s now evident that it’s more than just the light bulb that needs fixing… the more time you spend at home, the more you’ll realise how much work there is to be done! So take the time to tackle some interior improvements – be that painting your walls, upholstering old furniture or updating a room. If you're looking for a quality, timeless home accessory to spice up your space; take a look at our Persian and Oriental rugs collections - the perfect addition to liven up an otherwise boring space.\nWith all the spare time on your hands, there’s no better time to start filtering through all those odd jobs that you just never got around to. If it’s time to re-paint the skirting boards or to drill a hole in the wall and finally hang the mirror up - see what other DIY tasks you can find whilst you’re self-isolating. Remember health and safety at all times!\nImage Credit (left to right) - Pinterest\nJust to clarify, this does not mean transforming into the Incredible Hulk- we were thinking more along the lines of growing some veg or herbs! Whether you have a big garden or just an apartment balcony, you can go green. It’s also something fun to get the kids involved in too, and it should definitely take up a significant chunk of your time, especially while the weather is good! Not only will this give you a project to look after day-by-day, but it is also a cost-effective way of getting some sustenance.\nIf you’re limited to a balcony, keep your space versatile and uncluttered and use self-watering pots for home-grown herbs like rosemary, basil, chives, sage, mint, oregano, parsley and thyme. Introduce colour and natural elements to your house or garden and plant some flowers too - now that the sun is shining, it's the ideal time to get out in the garden and watch your flowers bloom.\nSTAY HOME AND WORK OUT\nImage Credit (left to right) - Pinterest, Lauren Gleisberg\nEnjoying your daily quarantine walk? Why not use the space inside your home for a daily at-home workout session too. You’ve been meaning to do it for a while now, but as they say, there’s no time like the present, and what better place than from the comfort of your own home? Transform your lounge into a yoga space and stretch it out - do it at a time you’d usually be home from work, so you can inject your newfound routines into your day-to-day life.\nYou can find some easy-to-follow workout routines on YouTube; with squats, burpees and press-ups all achievable without equipment. Here are some of our favourites:\nLEARN TO PLAY AN INSTRUMENT\nImage Credit (left to right) - Apartment Therapy, My Leitmotiv\nAs we prepare to spend a significant amount of time at home, we must focus on doing things that will enhance our skills and improve productivity. Perhaps you’ve been staring across the room at the dusty old guitar for months, well now is the time to pick it up and start learning. Practising an instrument can be good fun, and it’s also an inventive way to keep yourself entertained, especially when there are slim pickings when it comes to entertainment. Dedicate your new-found time to music and learn an instrument that you've always wanted to play.\nLEARN A LANGUAGE\nImage Credit - Nafsa\nGone are the days of buying a hard-to-follow book that translates English to the language of your choice. There are a ton of apps and websites that give you lessons for free; available on both iPhone and Android. Our top choice is Duolingo, which takes you through the basics in a course that lasts for as long as you need while you pick up the lingo. Challenge yourself to learn a new language in just a few weeks, it has never been easier and what better time to finally learn a language ready for your next trip away.\nWhatever you decide to spend your time doing during social distancing, it’s important to let your creative juices flow. Embark on a creative journey - it can be anything from; sketching and mindful colouring to pottery, cooking, crafts, writing and even throwing a cocktail evening at home for the family. More and more of us are turning to virtual slumber parties on video apps like Houseparty and Zoom so we can keep up with friends, have a laugh, a glass of wine or three, and make the best of the lockdown. So you can too!\nYou can check us out on Pinterest and Instagram to keep up to date with the latest trends and rug inspo. COVID-19 UPDATE - ONLINE SALES FULLY ACTIVE.

The Z-kinematics system also offers greater lift capacities and breakout forces.\nStoll Profiline loaders have a slim profile and, thanks to the use of fine grain steel in their construction, are relatively low in weight for the power they deliver. They also feature the Stoll Drive-In system enabling operators to attach the loader securely to their tractor and be ready for work in under 2 minutes.\nThere’s a wide range of options to choose from across the Profiline range.

{"id": "9361", "text": "Don’t worry, I’m not talking about actually turning your room into a bowling alley, or having your kids chuck heavy bowling balls towards your furniture. But, your kids can learn so much by setting up an indoor bowling alley.\nHow to Set Up a Pretend Bowling Lane\nIf you’re ready to give it a try, you’ll need to set up a bowling lane. Here’s what you need:\n- 10 plastic cups\n- 1 Playground ball (that has a bit of weight)\nThat’s it! Of course you can also get fancy and use masking tape to mark your lanes. But that’s definitely optional.\nAnd if you want, you can also purchase an indoor bowling set. That way you don’t have to worry about your plastic cups cracking or anything!\nHow to Bowl\nFind a location in your living room that has some space. You may need to scoot some furniture aside. We just slide our coffee table over to one side of the room, leaving an empty path straight down the middle.\nAs one end of your space, set up your plastic cups bowling pin style:\nThen, have your kids form a line at the other end. One at a time, they get the ball and bowl it down towards the cups. They get two chances to knock down as many cups as they can.\nNow it’s time to reset the pins and let another person take a turn.\nIt keeps my kids busy for at least an hour! 😀\nWhat Kids Learn in Your Homemade Bowling Alley\nWhile they’re busy having a great time, your kids are learning and practicing many skills. Here’s a look at a few of them.\nYounger kids can practice counting to ten each time the pins are set. They’ll also practice seeing the pattern. Each row increases by 1.\nSo the first row has 1. The second 2. Then 3. And finally 4.\nAs the first ball knocks down pins, you get to practice subtraction too! How many pins are left? How many pins got knocked down?\nBy keeping score, your children can practice additional math skills. Download a simple score sheet and work together to learn how they get points, and how to record strikes and spares.\nPins. Bowling ball. Alley. Lane. Strike. Spare.\nThere are plenty of words associated with bowling. As your kids play, you can introduce new vocabulary words to them.\n“Yay! You knocked down all the pins on your first ball. That’s a strike!”\n(And if you have kids familiar with baseball, you can talk about how a baseball strike isn’t good but a bowling strike is good. Words can have more than one meaning!)\nUsing vocabulary words in context helps make them more memorable, so use them in sentences and teach your kids new words.\nIt’s not always easy to take turn. Especially when there’s a ball involved. Kids get to practice this essential life skill when bowling in your living room.\nIt can be hard to wait for your turn, so suggest counting pins, singing the alphabet, or jumping up and down while waiting.\nLearning to offer encouraging words is important. Let your kids practice good sportsmanship and congratulate others on good turns, and share an encouraging word with someone who didn’t quite get it.\nKids sit plenty today, especially when it’s muddy or cold outside. Having another active play game that’s perfect for indoor play will help get everyone up and moving. Here are some other active indoor ideas for you:\nIndoor Bowling Extension Activities\nTo extend the learning, you can:\n- Write a story about bowling\n- Watch a YouTube video of professional bowlers\n- Set up a Bowling Alley snack bar and have the kids use pretend money to make purchases\n- Draw a diagram of a bowling alley\n- Practice different ways to throw the ball to get it to curve\n- Research the history of bowling\n- Write a poem about bowling\n- Make a paper bowling set with pins, a ball, and a lane\n- Tape an index card with a sight word on each pin. Set them up in a line and encourage your child to knock down the word you call, and then read it aloud.\nHave you ever done indoor bowling?\nDid you kids love indoor bowling as much as mine do? I’d love to hear about it!\nDo you think you’ll set up an alley of your own?", "scores": {"score": 4, "score_transform_1": 5, "score_transform_2": 5, "score_transform_3": 0}}

We turned 40! The board took a serious look at our mission, values, and vision statements and a new growth strategy. This was completed with the help of an outside firm, Convergent Non-Profit Solutions.\nThrough their assistance we conducted a feasibility study to learn our current position within the community and we also engaged them to lead our annual strategic planning session. We learned much, created a great blueprint to help us move forward and are looking forward to an outstanding 2024.\nMAS provided a full-time education coordinator to the arboretum this year. Hannah Hill was able to provide educational outlets throughout the year with our Little Sprouts program engaging children ages 2-5 in activities to heighten their awareness of nature and the world around them.\nNature Home School Groups\nNature Home School Groups were also developed for grades K-5. Home schooler groups came to the arboretum to explore the theme “Around the World in Ecosystems.”\nIn partnership with the Lahontan Audubon Society monthly bird walks were offered enabling members and the community to tour the arboretum and learn about the species of birds that migrate through during the seasons.\nSpring and Fall tree walks were led by arborist Rod Haulenbeek. Members and the community were led around the arboretum to learn about the life cycle of trees, how they can talk to you, what happens when they wake up in spring and then go to bed in the fall.\nTwo test gardens were developed. These gardens are in anticipation of our proposed newest garden, The Cactus and Succulent Garden. These test gardens will help us to determine the best soil mixture to use and what cacti will hardy over the winter here in Reno. These studies are critical to the installation and success of the garden.\nIn 2023 the society provided $164,681 in funding to the arboretum.\nOur society continues to support the arboretum through the funding of staff. While the industry standard is 1 FTE per cultivated acre the arboretum runs much short of this. We provide 3 full-time employees of the 6 who work year-round. The criticality of this resource to the arboretum is paramount.\nDue to the big winter the arboretum suffered many downed trees. Our society provided funding for 27 replacement trees.\nTo help eliminate many hours of manual labor we purchased a snowplow attachment for one of our mule carts. What took many hours of manual snow removal has now been eliminated with the use of the plow.\nIn 2016 the society received an anonymous donation of $5,000,000.00 to start an endowment to enable the long-term sustainability of the Wilbur D. May Arboretum and Botanical Gardens. This endowment is managed by Vicken Ekmekjian, CFA and Managing Director with CIBC Wealth Advisors in San Francisco.\nThe long-term goal is to raise the fund to 20 million dollars. With this goal our society would be able to assure the long-term sustainability of the arboretum. It would allow us to cover the costs of maintaining the operations and growth of the arboretum that is so loved by much of the community without having to worry about economic turns and the current inability of the county to fully embrace the necessary care needed to present a world class presence that we hope will become a destination attraction of Reno.\nThe following graphs depict the 2023 performance of the fund:\n- Profit and Loss\n- Balance Sheet\n2023 Profit and Loss\nDividends and Interest\nWashoe County Arboretum Support\nNet Operating Income\nTotal Other Income\nAs of December 31, 2023\nOther Current Assets\nTotal Current Assets\nLIABILITIES AND EQUITY\nOther Current Liabilities\nTotal Current Liabilities\nTOTAL LIABILITIES AND EQUITY\nMission, Vision, and Values\nThe newly developed statements will guide our organization going forward.\nEnsure the Wilbur D.

{"id": "9382", "text": "In today’s digital age, businesses are looking for ways to reach their Target audience in the most efficient way possible. One of the most popular ways to do so is through mobile devices.\nHowever, there are different ways to develop a mobile presence – through native apps, mobile web apps, or hybrid apps. In this article, we’ll explore the differences between these three options and help you decide which one is right for your business.\nNative apps are developed specifically for a particular mobile platform such as iOS or Android. They are built using programming languages and tools that are specific to those platforms. Native apps can be downloaded from app stores like Google Play or the Apple App Store.\n- Native apps provide a seamless user experience as they integrate with the device’s operating system.\n- They have access to device-specific features like camera, microphone, and GPS.\n- They can be used offline once downloaded.\n- Developing native apps can be expensive and time-consuming as they require separate development for each platform.\n- Maintaining native apps can also be challenging since updates need to be released separately for each platform.\n- The app needs to be approved by the app store before it can be released for download.\nMobile Web Apps\nMobile web apps are essentially websites that are optimized for viewing on mobile devices. They run on web browsers like Safari or Chrome and don’t need to be downloaded from an app store.\n- Mobile web apps are easier and cheaper to develop compared to native apps since they only require one codebase that works across all platforms.\n- The development process is faster since there’s no need to wait for app store approval.\n- Mobile web apps can be updated instantly without the need for users to download a new version.\n- Mobile web apps are not as fast and responsive as native apps since they rely on internet connectivity and web browsers.\n- They have limited access to device-specific features like camera, microphone, and GPS.\n- Users may find it challenging to discover mobile web apps since they are not available in app stores.\n- Hybrid apps can be developed faster and at a lower cost compared to developing separate native apps for each platform.\n- They can be downloaded from app stores like native apps, giving them better visibility among users.\n- Hybrid apps have access to device-specific features like camera, microphone, and GPS.\n- The performance of hybrid apps may not be as good as native apps since they rely on web technologies to some extent.\n- The development process can still be time-consuming since the app needs to be tested on different platforms before release.\nChoosing between native, mobile web, or hybrid app development depends on your business requirements. If you need an app that provides the best possible user experience with access to device-specific features, then a native app is the way to go.\nIf you’re looking for a more cost-effective solution that works across all platforms with instant updates, then a mobile web app might be the best option. However, if you want the best of both worlds, then a hybrid app may be the perfect solution for your business.", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}

{"id": "9439", "text": "Find My Local Expert Warning Signs Your Home Needs Roof...Read More\nYour roof is an obviously crucial part of your home. It protects you from the elements, forms an integral part of the structure, and, let’s be honest, your home would look strange without one. No one needs the importance of their roof explaining to them, but they often need the importance of roof inspections explaining.\nBeing constantly exposed to the elements, your roof is in a continual state of degradation. Unfortunately, problems with your roof might not be evident until they are very serious and very expensive. Roof inspections ensure that you are not caught off-guard by any problems, and increase the chances of catching a problem early.\nA roof inspection is a thorough examination of a property’s roof by a professional inspector. Using a range of specialist equipment, they will inspect everything from surfacing materials to dormers. If they find any points of concern, they will recommend a course of action for you to take.\nIf a large hole were to appear in your roof, or a dozen tiles were to slide off, you would likely notice it. Unfortunately, roof problems are often a little less obvious. It is far more common for a roof to develop a small leak that is all but invisible to the naked, ground-based eye, and that leak could persist for years before the damage it causes inside becomes apparent to the homeowner.\nOther more subtle problems include a detrimental effect on your utility bills. Some types of roof insulation do not react well to moisture, and their insulative properties will degrade if they are subjected to a roof leak. Similarly, problems with roof ventilation can result in damp and excessive use of air conditioning in warmer parts of the world.\nUltimately, while we thoroughly recommend homeowners perform an occasional visual inspection of their roof to check for the aforementioned big holes and slipped tiles, you simply can’t spot everything from the ground. And before you go pulling the ladder out of the garage, there’s still a lot you can miss with untrained eyes.\nTrained roof inspectors not only have thoroughly trained eyes, but they also have a great deal of gadgetry to make the task faster, more efficient, and safer, such as camera drones.\nOf course, the main reason to have a roof inspection is that it is nearly always less disruptive—and less expensive—to deal with a roofing problem earlier rather than later. For many roofing issues, if you wait until it is obvious that there is a problem, you have probably missed your window for a straightforward repair.\nThere is also a safety element to consider. It is unlikely your roof will collapse in on itself because of a lack of inspection, but a loose tile falling from a roof can still be very dangerous, especially if it is a multiple-story building. A roof survey could catch such a loose tile, allowing you to deal with it before it falls on somebody’s head!\nNaturally, the precise length of a roof inspection will vary greatly depending on the size of the roof and the nature of the building. If access to the roof is restricted, that can lengthen the time it takes to complete the inspection. Similarly, if the attic space is to be inspected along with the roof, that will also add to the time it takes.\nAs a general rule, you can expect a roof inspection to take at least 45 minutes. However, depending on other factors, it could be as much as several hours. It can help to speak to your potential roof inspector beforehand, as they should be able to give you a more precise estimate of how long the inspection will take.\nYour inspector will be looking for any signs of a problem when they inspect your roof, but there are certain areas that receive attention because they are the most likely culprits for a developing problem.\nYour roofer will look for signs of structural problems, such as cracks and falling roof sections. This will include looking at masonry, vents, chimneys, and skylights for any signs of cracking. They will also look for signs of damaged flashing or crumbling sealant.\nThe next stop will be your tiles or shingles (if you have them). Missing or loose tiles or shingles are not a good sign, and neither is moss growth or rust stains. Your roofer will also look for excessive shingle grains in your guttering, as that is a sign that your shingles are ready to be replaced.\nFinally, your roofer will want to inspect interior walls and ceilings for signs of leakage, such as rot and mold. These things do not necessarily mean there is a roof leak (there could be a leaking water pipe somewhere) but they can be a sign of a leaking roof. And, in any case, if there is dampness and mold in your property, you’ll want to know about it.\nThe roof inspection should not be a disruptive process, as the inspector is just looking around for signs of a problem. You shouldn’t face anything louder than a ladder being placed against your outer wall, footsteps in your attic, or perhaps the hum of a drone flying around your property. The exception to this is if your roofer needs to make any emergency repairs, but if an emergency repair is required, a little disruption will be the much lesser of two evils.\nAgain, much of the variation in the cost of a roof survey will come down to the size and design of your roof. The expense can broadly be equated to the time it takes to do the inspection, however, the use of certain tools may raise the cost. As a rough guide, expect a roof inspection on a typical residential property to cost somewhere in the region of £150 to £500.\nYou may find some roofers will offer you a special rate if their inspection reveals that work needs doing and you hire them to do said work, but this will be specific to the roofer, and should not be expected.\nIf you were thinking that the best time to get your roof inspected is when there is an obvious problem, you wouldn’t be alone in that thought. Unfortunately, that’s not the case. The beauty of a roof inspection is that it enables you to catch problems before they become obvious, which won’t work if you only get your roof inspected when you’ve noticed something.\nAs a general rule, the roof of a property should be inspected when that property changes hands. It will usually be the buyer paying for the roof inspection, as the amount of work (if any) that needs doing will factor into their offer. However, it is good practice to have your roof inspected at regular intervals after that.\nBest practice would be to have your roof inspected twice a year, once in the fall and once in spring. For most areas in the country, winter is by far the hardest time of year on the roof, with more rain, temperature extremes, and even ice. Having an inspection in the fall will ensure you catch any potential problems before the winter weather hits. Similarly, an inspection in spring will reveal if the pressures of winter did any damage, and allow you to get them fixed before any heavy spring rains set in and exacerbate matters.\nOnce the inspection is complete, your roofer should present you with a report detailing the condition of your roof, including any problems they have found. These problems will likely be prioritised to show whether they are just in need of attention in the future, or in need of urgent repair. Needless to say, if your roofer finds any urgent matters, you should arrange to get those matters dealt with as soon as possible.\nIf your roof inspector is a roofer themselves—or if they represent a roofing firm—they can probably give you an estimate for carrying out the work they have recommended, though you should be free to get quotes from other roofers before committing to one.\nWhile roof inspections can feel somewhat unnecessary at times, they can save you a lot of money and disruption in the long run. Roofing problems can very easily develop into significant (and expensive) issues if left untreated, and it is easy to miss a roofing problem if you don’t know what you are looking for, or are not looking in the first place!\nIt is recommended to have your roof inspected twice a year—once either side of winter—but you should also get in the habit of occasionally performing your own visual inspection from the ground. Anything obvious enough to be spotted from there is certainly something that needs dealing with immediately.", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}

{"id": "9443", "text": "- Voted Best Personal Injury Attorney\n- Voted Best Law Firm\n- Voted Best Customer Service\nLAS VEGAS UNDERINSURED/UNINSURED COVERAGE ATTORNEY\nLas Vegas Lawyer Helps Underinsured & Uninsured Motorists\nIn Nevada, it is illegal to drive a car without automobile insurance and there are serious consequences for a failure to purchase coverage. For instance, a driver’s failure to obtain car insurance can lead to his or her license and registration being suspended. Unfortunately, despite these repercussions, many drivers choose to ignore this requirement, which can cause significant financial hardship for someone injured in an accident with an uninsured driver.\nPurchasing uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage is an effective way to ensure that if you are injured in a car accident and only have the minimum required coverage, you receive the compensation you need to address your injuries and repair any property damage. If you live in Las Vegas and were recently injured in a car accident and the other driver did not have insurance or did not have a policy with enough coverage to compensate you for your injuries, obtaining the advice of an experienced underinsured/uninsured coverage attorney can make all the difference in whether or not you are able to recover under your own policy.\nIf you are the victim of a hit-and-run accident, you are likely overwhelmed not knowing how your medical bills will be covered. Seek help immediately from an experienced personal injury attorney prepared to help relieve your financial stress.\nAt Naqvi Injury Law, we have extensive experience handling complicated cases. Our founding attorney, Farhan Naqvi, routinely litigated more than 200 cases when working at the largest personal injury law firm in Nevada. His strong background includes protecting accident victims hit by uninsured and underinsured motorists.\nSchedule a FREE Initial Consultation\nContact our law firm by e-mail or call us to schedule a free initial consultation. We are compassionate, yet aggressive when protecting accident victims and family who lost loved ones in wrongful death accidents. Located in Las Vegas, our firm serves clients throughout the state of Nevada.\nNevada adheres to a fault-based car accident liability system, which means that the driver who causes an accident is required to pay for the injuries and property damage incurred by injured parties. For this reason, a person injured in a car accident can choose to pursue one of the following options:\n- File a claim under his or her own insurance policy;\n- File a claim with the at-fault party’s car insurance company, also known as a third party claim; or\n- File a personal injury lawsuit against the at-fault driver.\nMinimum Insurance Coverage\nNevada law requires that all drivers purchase minimum car insurance coverage from a state-licensed insurer. Drivers must then provide proof of insurance to the Department of Motor Vehicles before their cars can be registered. According to state law, minimum coverage must include at least:\n- $15,000 for bodily injury to one person in an accident;\n- $30,000 for bodily injury when more than one person is hurt in an accident; and\n- $10,000 for property damage per accident.\nThis minimum coverage for property damage covers the damage a policyholder causes to another person’s car. Unfortunately, it does not cover the cost of repairing or replacing the policyholder’s own car. To ensure that these costs are paid in the event of an accident, drivers should purchase comprehensive car insurance.\nWhile having these minimum requirements ensures that injured parties will be able to recover at least a portion of the expenses related to an accident, it also means that in most cases, the other person’s insurance will not cover the entirety of the victim’s costs. For this reason, Nevada law also requires insurance companies to offer uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage in an amount equal to the minimum liability coverage required by law and no greater than the liability coverage limits already chosen by the insured on his or her policy. Furthermore, the offer must be made in writing on a pre-approved form and included with each policy renewal. Insurers are also required to obtain a policyholder’s rejection of this coverage in writing. In the event that an insurer fails to offer the required coverage, the court will proceed as though the coverage were included in the policy.\nDrivers are strongly advised to purchase uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage to match their policy’s bodily injury limits as many accidents result in injuries that require treatment totaling more than $15,000. Even when injuries are relatively minor, injured parties may be required to pay for:\n- Emergency transport;\n- Diagnostic tests;\n- Evaluation by a physician;\n- Follow-up appointments;\n- Transportation costs; and\n- Prescription medications.\nInjured parties may also be required to take time off from work until they have recovered. This can make it even more difficult to pay medical bills, creating additional stress for victims and their families.\nUninsured Motorist Coverage\nMost uninsured motorist coverage pays up to a policy’s limits for:\n- Injuries sustained by a policyholder while driving or riding in the car named in his or her policy, while a pedestrian, or while driving or riding in a car owned by someone else;\n- Injuries sustained by a policyholder’s relative who resides with him or her while driving in the car named in the policy;\n- Any person riding in or driving the car named in the policy as long as he or she obtained permission from the owner; or\n- Any person riding in a car the policyholder is driving, but does not own.\nSome types of uninsured motorist policies cover situations where a policyholder is involved in an accident with an unidentified hit-and-run driver. However, this coverage does not apply unless the policyholder or his or her car was struck. Most policies also require that the insured notify law enforcement of the accident within 24 hours of its occurrence. In these cases, if a policyholder fails to report the accident in time, his or her insurer may refuse to cover the costs of the injury.\nSome policies are even more restrictive and do not cover hit-and-run accidents when the at-fault driver or car cannot be identified. Additionally, if a policyholder receives funds to cover medical bills from alternative coverage, the recoverable amount he or she is entitled to under an uninsured motorist policy will be reduced by that amount. Finally, when a policyholder is injured while in another person’s car, the uninsured motorist coverage of the car’s owner will primarily cover the policyholder’s injury. Only the amount that is not repaid by the car’s owner can be covered by an insured’s policy.\nOnce a person files a claim under his or her uninsured motorist coverage, an adjuster will be assigned to handle the claim. The parties will then decide on an amount based on the other person’s negligence, whether the policyholder contributed to the accident, the severity of the injuries sustained, and the number of victims involved in the accident.\nUnderinsured Motorist Coverage\nIn some cases, a person who causes an accident will have some insurance coverage, but not enough to cover the full amount of the other party’s injuries. In these situations, a policyholder with underinsured coverage can collect up to the limits of the policy. However, medical payments recovered under another policy will be deducted from the total provided by underinsured coverage.\nFiling an underinsured motorist claim requires that the policyholder provide evidence to his or her insurer establishing that the other driver’s insurance is not enough to cover the cost of his or her injuries. This may require that the policyholder obtain a letter explaining the other driver’s policy limits as well as a statement acknowledging settlement from the other driver’s insurer. Sometimes these letters are even included with the settlement paperwork.\nFiling a Claim Against an Uninsured Driver\nGenerally, filing a claim against an uninsured driver in court is not a viable option because most uninsured drivers do not have sufficient funds or assets to pay off a judgement. If the at-fault party does not pay a court-ordered judgement, the policyholder can always request a court order requiring the defendant to pay. If the court discovers that the defendant does have access to some assets, it might set up a payment plan, requiring the at-fault party to pay a certain amount per week. Often, these payments are extremely small and rarely beneficial to the injured party. If there is evidence that the other driver actually has valuable assets, a plaintiff may be able to file a lien against the other party’s property during the proceedings.\nIt is usually a better option to file a claim with the policyholder’s own insurer under his or her uninsured motorist coverage than to file a claim in court. After negotiations, the policyholder will be awarded an amount to cover at least part of his or her expenses, as uninsured benefits cannot exceed the amount of primary coverage. This means that if a policyholder has $100,000 worth of coverage, he or she can only have up to $100,000 in uninsured policy benefits. Keep in mind that if a policyholder and his or her insurer cannot agree on an appropriate settlement amount, the only method of resolution is binding arbitration to be followed by a hearing before a panel of arbitrators.\nProtecting Victims of Uninsured Motorists\nWe devote ample resources to proving fault in complicated personal injury cases.

{"id": "9457", "text": "A couple of years back I shared my reading list and wrote about the books I found most interesting. But then, after that, I have been reading some more over the past few months, here are my recent favorites:\n1. Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality - by LessWrong\nA \"parallel universe\" Harry Potter fiction written by Eliezer Yudkowsky (A.K.A. LessWrong), an AI researcher, writer and decision theorist at the Singularity Institute for Artificial Intelligence. The fan fiction story illustrates topics in cognitive science and rationality, recasting the original story in an attempt to explain Harry's wizardry through the scientific method.\nPetunia Evans has married an Oxford biochemistry professor and young genius Harry grows up fascinated by science and technology. When he finds out that he is a wizard, he tries to apply scientific principles to his study of magic, with sometimes surprising results. With magic now seemingly a proven reality, Harry now takes his place at Hogwarts, armed with Enlightenment ideals and the experimental spirit.\nThe text contains many clues: obvious clues, not-so-obvious clues and truly obscure hints. This is a rationalist story; its mysteries are solvable, and meant to be solved. All science mentioned is real science.\nThe fanfiction is known for possibly being the most reviewed Harry Potter fanfiction, with over 20,000 reviews on Fanfiction.net as of July, 2013.\nDisclaimer: J. K. Rowling owns Harry Potter, and no one owns the methods of rationality.\n2. Influencer (The power to change anything) - by Kerry Patterson, Joseph Grenny, David Maxfield, Ron McMillan and Al Switzler\nLeading is hard. And the only thing harder than leading a team towards a common vision – provided you are able to unite it in the first place – is leading a team through change. Change is harder.\nThere is no magic formula for managing change, but the book \"Influencer: The Power to Change Anything\" provides a great framework.\nThe authors first point out what does not work: talking. You can’t explain logically to people why they must change their behaviors and expect anything to happen. Peoples' behaviors are tuned to what they believe is in their best self interests. Unless you can change that belief, you have little chance of changing their behaviors.\nInfluence is about changing hearts, minds, and behavior to produce meaningful, sustainable results.\nIn short, don’t waste time on how to create change until you’ve clarified what you want, why you want it, and when you want it. The book explains how to find vital behaviors, use a strategic and varied approach to influence individuals and groups.\n3. The Undefeated Mind: On the Science of Constructing an Indestructible Self - by Alex Lickerman\nA book about how to surmount the challenges that life throws our way. It’s a powerful book that helps you cultivate your inner strength to face hard times with a fearless heart. It’s more than a book. It’s a set of tools for life.\nThe tools in this book help you stand strong when tested. The key, according to Dr. Lickerman, is turning adversity into wisdom. It’s that wisdom that helps you develop your resilience and achieve indestructible peace.\nIt’s also a beautiful blend of ancient wisdom and modern science, offering a set of guidelines not for solving problems but for establishing a life state that makes all problems solvable, and dramatically increase your ability to withstand adversity.\nIt doesn't just happen automatically, and it takes practice. Extraordinary people may be born, but they can also be made.\n4. Who is pulling your strings? (how to break the cycle of manipulation and regain control) - by Harriet Braiker\nIn \"Who's Pulling Your Strings?\", Dr. Harriet B. Braiker exposes the most common methods of manipulators, and with the help of self-assessment quizzes, action plans, and how-to exercises, she helps you recognize, end and avoid the manipulative cycle (for good) through lots of straight-forward techniques.\n5. The Power of Now: A Guide to Spiritual Enlightenment - by Ekhart Tolle\nA guide stressing the importance of living in the present moment and avoiding thoughts of the past or future. The author writes that an individual should be aware of their \"present moment\" instead of losing themselves in worry and anxiety about the past or future.\nAccording to the book, only the present moment is important, and both an individual's past and future is created by their thoughts. The author maintains that people's insistence that they have control of their life is an illusion that only brings pain. The book also describes methods of relaxation and meditation to aid readers in anchoring themselves in the present. These suggestions include slowing down life by avoiding multi-tasking, spending time in nature, and letting go of worries about the future.\nAlthough the journey is challenging, Eckhart Tolle uses simple language and an easy question and answer format to guide you.\n6. I was blind but now I see - by James Altucher\nJames Altucher is one of my favorite bloggers. In this book he attempts two things. First, he tries to create some awareness about a wide variety of issues that we tend to take for granted/as normal without actually considering why, using clear cut arguments and mentioning alternatives to make his points.\nSecondly, the author describes how to deal with the awareness and to get the confidence/strength to do things in your own way. Funny, brutally honest and thought-provoking.\n7. Shut up, stop whining and get a life - by Larry Winget\nThis is not your typical self-help book. This book won't make you feel good about yourself and that's a good thing. If you are hoping to improve yourself with a bunch of feel-good mantras, then this book is NOT for you. But if you are ready to get up and really change your life, then Larry Winget is your man. Larry (A.K.A. the Pitbull of Personal Development) is direct, caustic, and controversial. His tough-love approach boils success down to a simple formula: your life failures are your own freaking fault, and if you shut up, stop whining, and take action, your life will get better.\n8. The 50th Law - by 50 Cent and Robert Greene\nPop culture and hip hop icon 50 Cent joins forces with Robert Greene, bestselling author, to write collaboratively a bible for success in life and work based on a single principle: fear nothing.\nThey came up with The 50th Law, a New York Times bestselling book on strategy and fearlessness.\nThe book is a semi-autobiographical account detailing 50 Cent's rise as both a young urban hustler and as an up-and-coming musician with lessons and anecdotes from historical figures such as Abraham Lincoln, Sun Tzu, Socrates, Napoleon, Malcolm X, and James Baldwin.\n9. The Millionnaire Mind - by Thomas Stanley\nThe Millionaire Mind draws from the author's research of America's affluent to examine the ideas, beliefs and practices of the segment of the financial elite that use little or no consumer credit.\nThe book analyzes the common environmental and lifestyle factors that preceded and resulted in this researched segment's ability to accumulate wealth, by exploring the attitudes and skills that enabled these millionaires to build and maintain their fortunes.\n10. How to live on 24 hours a day - by Arnold Bennett\nTime is a very funny thing; everyone gets the same amount per day. No one receives either more or less than you receive. It's not possible to go to the store and buy time. But time is the inexplicable raw material of everything. With it, all is possible; without it, nothing is possible.\nThe author states that time is the most precious of commodities. He said that many books have been written on how to live on a certain amount of money each day, but he adds that the old adage \"time is money\" understates the matter, as time can often produce money, but money cannot produce more time. Time is extremely limited, and Bennett urged others to make the best of the time remaining in their lives.\nHow to Live on 24 Hours a Day offers practical advice on how one might live (as opposed to just existing) within the confines of 24 hours a day. A classic piece on self improvement teaching you to live to the fullest.\n11. The Power of Habit (Why We Do What We Do in Life and Business) - by Charles Duhigg\nHabits can save us or ruin us in a thousand ways; in fact, these \"automatic responses\" affect every arena of our lives.\nIn The Power of Habit, Pulitzer Prize–winning business reporter Charles Duhigg explores the science behind habit creation and reformation. He takes us to the thrilling edge of scientific discoveries that explain why habits exist and how they can be changed.\nAt its core, The Power of Habit contains a sensible argument: The key is understanding how habits work.\n12. On Writing, a Memoir of the Craft - by Stephen King\nOn Writing is part biography and part how-to. Stephen King (world best-selling author of contemporary horror, supernatural fiction, suspense, science fiction, and fantasy) writes about his childhood and young adulthood, relating stories that made him the writer he has become. Stephen King then moves into the mechanics of writing, offering advice and insight into a successful career that has worked so well for him but remains distant for thousands of others.\n13. Principles - by Ray Dalio\nPrinciples is like a modern day meditation guide aimed at personal, professional and career development.\nRay Dalio, self-made multi-billionaire, details the purpose and importance of having principles in general, his most fundamental life principles that apply to everything he does, and his management principles.\n14. Introduction to Metaphysics - by Henri Bergson\nA thought provoking essay about the concept of reality by Henri Bergson. For Bergson, reality occurs not in a series of discrete states but as a process similar to that described by process philosophy or the Greek philosopher Heraclitus. Reality is fluid and cannot be completely understood through reductionistic analysis, which he said \"implies that we go around an object\", gaining knowledge from various perspectives which are relative. Instead, reality can be grasped absolutely only through intuition, which Bergson expressed as \"entering into\" the object.\nThis is a difficult book but his ideas about time and the value of immediate experience are definitely worthwhile.", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}

{"id": "9512", "text": "Bozza's published his eagerly-awaited \"roadmap\" now, so there's light at the end of the tunnel for us all. At the risk of putting the mockers on it, we can possibly even contemplate organising a much-needed holiday at some point (I've been missing the sea!). However, for now the message is that we still stay local and that will certainly apply to my fishing for the rest of the river season.\nReally have to struggle to remember the last time I went a whole month without fishing. Had planned to have a few trips in between Christmas and New Year, but that went out the window when I did my back in on Christmas Eve. I've had a weakness in my lower back ever since I put it out lifting sugar beet by hand whilst doing crop trials as a student with the Ministry of Agriculture. Whilst I try to be careful, there are occasions when just minor, random movements are enough to leave me contorted and hobbling for days - luckily a good physio lives down at the end of our road!\nI suppose it was in the early ‘90s that I first started thinking of myself as a “specimen” angler, having become an avid reader of authors such as Phil Smith, Tony Miles and Peter Stone. However, my first proper “big fish” campaign wasn't on the River Ouse or a big Midlands gravel pit, but on the tiny River Mease on the Leicestershire/Staffordshire border. I’d just started work as an Assistant Biologist with the National Rivers Authority, based at Fradley near Lichfield. At the time my commute back home to Nottingham saw me cutting across country from the A38 to the M42 through the numerous villages along the Mease valley. One late summer’s day, just out of curiosity, I happened to stop and stick my head over a bridge and instantly spotted a massive (well, to me anyway!) chub drifting through the cabbages. A sign nailed to a tree indicated that day tickets for the stretch were available from the local pub, so I had a venue and a target! The first few trips in daylight that Autumn resulted in very little, so I decided to change tactics and fish into dark, thinking that the fish would be more confident.\nAt the business end, a simple link leger and a size 6 hook to accommodate a big lump of garlic sausage. At the start of each session a few freebies were flicked into suitably chubby-looking spots, which were then fished in rotation. With no isotopes or head torch, bite detection was achieved by keeping the rod high and propping up a torch at an angle on the ground to illuminate the white quiver tip.\nThat capture is still particularly memorable as I’d arrived to find a chap and his son, who was sat in a swim that I was intending to pre-bait, already fishing. After a quick chat and some subtle intelligence gathering I therefore headed further upstream. Much later, after catching just a couple of small fish, I wandered back downstream in the dark to find that they’d gone.\nTwo more 5lbers followed before the end of the year. However, my association with the River Mease ended abruptly after the section was taken over by a small club from Birmingham.\nBy all accounts the fishing went rapidly downhill, possibly due in part to issues with water quality, but the angling pressure wouldn’t have helped. However, that might not be the end of the story. Mid-pandemic, but under the more relaxed circumstances of the summer, I found myself travelling along the River Mease valley once more. Again, out of curiosity, I stopped at a bridge and peered over into the water below. The river was clear and weed-filled with a clean gravel bottom and, whilst I didn’t spot any monsters this time, there were a few small fish dimpling on the surface further downstream. Enough to re-kindle some interest? We’ll see what the rest of lockdown brings!", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

{"id": "9568", "text": "Various indicators are used by traders for forex trading in Sri Lanka in order to get some detailed understanding of the supply and demand of currencies. There are many ways to analyze the forex market and what’s important is how to use various technical tools to analyze the market information. You can learn to analyze the market conditions and anticipate the price movements using elements like charts, patterns, and forex indicators.\nThe main purpose of using these elements is to accomplish the price forecasting. Using charts and patterns, you can comprehend and process past market data of the forex market and, you can put some efforts into anticipating future price movements.\nLine, Bar and Candlestick Charts\nLine Chart in Forex\nA line chart joins the sequential data points using a line and this chart is utilized by forex traders to keep track of closing prices of the currency. This chart is one of the most preferred charts used by forex traders and is formed by connecting a few successive closing prices together. In addition, line charts can be utilized for any time-frame. A line chart provides the forex traders with a distinct image of the price movements of a currency over a period of specified time. As the closing prices are considered as the most important price of the trading day, it can be seen why line charts are so often used by traders in the forex market.\nBar Chart in Forex\nBar charts are the charts that display the movement of prices of a currency over a specified time period. Bar charts are used for technical analysis in order to measure the performance of the currency in the forex market. A bar chart comprises a few elements:\n- The right side of the bar contains the closing price.\n- The left side of the bar contains the opening price.\n- The top of the bar signifies the highest price of the currency during the day trading.\n- The bottom of the bar signifies the lowest price of the currency during the day trading.\nA single bar covers a predetermined time-frame, which is usually one day. Nonetheless, a bar chart can at times also cover the time-frame from one minute to a week or more.\nCandlestick chart in Forex\nCandlestick is very much like bar chart as it also shows the opening price, high price, low price, and close price for the trading day in the forex market. Usually, the candlestick shows the data for one trading day. The candlestick has a broad body, also referred to as the real body. The real body shows the range of currency prices which lies between the opening and closing price of the currency for a day's trading. When the closing price is lower than the opening price, the real body will be black, and when the closing price is higher than the closing price, the real body will be empty.\nThere are thousands of traders who trade in the forex market on an everyday basis and it can be difficult to make trading decisions. Chart patterns are one way to identify the future price movements. They focus on the bigger picture and help the traders in recognizing the future price movements.\nChart patterns have pre-defined distinctness and criteria, but no pattern can guarantee 100% accuracy or certainty when it comes to price movements in future. The most favorite chart patterns are reversals and continuations. A reversal pattern shows that the price movement will reverse at the end of the pattern and a continuation pattern shows that the prices will move with the same pattern even after the pattern gets completed.\nGiven below are some of the most popular chart patterns that are used in the forex market:\nHead and Shoulders\nThe Head and Shoulders is a reversal kind of chart pattern that shows that the price movements might follow a reversal trend once the pattern is finished. It has two types, standard head and shoulders top pattern and head and shoulder bottom pattern. The top pattern shows that the price movement for a currency pair will move downwards when the pattern is completed at the highest point of an upward trend. The bottom pattern shows that the price of the currency pair will rise after a downward pattern is completed.\nCup and Handle\nThe cup and handle pattern can be both, reversal and continuation chart pattern. For reversal pattern to occur, the price must be moving downwards. As the cup has the rounded bottom, that is where the reversal patterns take place as prices start moving upwards from the bottom of the cup. When a cup pattern is formed, the price should take a pause and move sideways or lower to create a handle. For a continuation pattern, the prices must be moving upwards. The price movement will form a cup shape patterns and creates a handle, and then breaks out of the handle to keep moving upwards.\nDouble Tops and Bottoms\nThe Double Tops and Bottoms chart pattern is easy to identify and also one of the most dependable analytical tools in the forex market. A double top is formed when the price reaches a high point in the upward trend and then moves downward to a new low point. Then again some time in near future price touches a new high point, very close to the previous high point and then falls below the previous low point. It is recognized as double top as the price reaches the high point twice in the same zone, incapable of moving ahead of that zone.\nA double bottom is formed when the price reaches a low point during the downward trend and then pulls back and starts moving upwards to a high point. When the price movement once again faces a decline, it touches the low point near to the previous low point, and then move upwards and touches the point higher than the previous high point. It is recognized as double bottom as both times price reached a low point in the same area and was not able to move below that.\nTriangle chart pattern is one of the most known patterns employed in the technical forex analysis as they appear more frequently as compared to other patterns. The three regular kinds of triangle patterns are ascending, descending, and symmetrical. The triangle patterns can last from a few weeks to many months.\nIn symmetrical triangles, two market trend lines meet each other and indicate that a breakout may take place. Ascending triangles has a straight upward trend line and a lower trend line which is moving upwards, conveying that a breakout might occur. In descending triangles, there is a straight lower trend line and an upper trend line which is moving downwards, conveying that a breakdown might occur.\nFlags & Pennants\nFlags and Pennants are a form of continuation patterns. They show a sharp price movement, upwards or downwards, then there is a short sideways or downside movement and then the prevailing trend continues. This sideways movement usually creates a rectangle form, known as flag pattern, and when it creates a triangle form, it is called a pennant pattern.\nCandlesticks patterns are formed when the price movements are represented by a candle body. Candle body It is a solidified area existing between the opening and closing price of the currency, and the wicks display the high and low points. Given below are some of the popular candlestick patterns:\nLet’s take a look at four of the most popular candlestick patterns along with several actual stock chart examples in order to show their worth.\nBullish Engulfing Candlestick\nBullish engulfing candlestick pattern occurs with the combination of two candlesticks of the current day and the previous day. The candle from the previous day is black candlestick and candle of the current day is the white candlestick.\nFor the previous day, the price opens at an almost highest point and closes at the almost lowest point for the day. This forms the first candle which is the black candle.\nFor the next or current day, the price opens at price below the closing price of the previous day. It increases the demand for the currency and price begins to move upwards. The day session closes at the price above the high price of the previous day.\nThus the white candle engulfs the black candle completely.\nBearish Engulfing Candlestick\nBearish Engulfing Pattern occurs with the combination of two candlesticks of previous and current day. The previous day candle is the white candle and current day candle is the black candle.\nFor the previous day, the price opens at a nearly lowest price of the day and at the end of the day, the price closes at a nearly highest price of the day. It forms the first and white candle. For the next or current day, the price opens at the level above the closing price of the previous day and then the price starts to move downwards.\nThe price keeps on falling and closes at the price below the closing price of the previous day. This forms the black candle, which engulfs the white candle completely.\nHammer Candlestick Pattern\nA hammer candlestick pattern is formed when forex traders turn down the support or resistance levels. When Hammer pattern is formed, it means that the opening price, highest price, and the closest price are close to each other so that the real body is small in size. It also has a long lower shadow, which is at least twice the size of the real body.\nDoji Candlestick Pattern\nDoji candlestick pattern shows the indecision which is felt by the traders when it comes to the price action of a currency. Here, the opening and closing prices of a currency are almost equal. Doji candlesticks look like a cross or a plus sign. A Doji can be seen at the top and bottom of the market trends and can also be seen as a sign of possible reversal or continuation patterns based on the circumstances.\nThe best way to identify the most suitable forex indicator is to see how it suits your trading style and perspective. There are a variety of forex indicators and you can find that will be right for you. Some of them are:\nA moving average is a popular forex indicator which is used in the technical analysis in smoothing out the price movement action by removing the random price swings from the main action. The two fundamental moving averages are the simple and exponential moving average. A simple moving average is calculated based on over a definite number of time periods. The Exponential moving average gives more weightage to the recent prices. Usually, moving averages are used to determine the direction of the market trend and identify support and resistance levels.\nFractals are indicators that help in recognizing the reversal levels in the market. Forex traders utilize the fractals to identify the future price direction and movements.\nMost of the trading platforms with chart features provide fractals so that traders can just use the indicator on the chart to figure out the price patterns.\nBollinger Bands is a forex indicator, formulated by John Bollinger. It is used to determine the level of volatility in the forex market. Basically, when the market is unagitated, the bands will shrink in size and when the market gets noisy, the bands will spread out.\nRSI stands for Relative Strength Index. It is a momentum forex indicator that determines the speeding and change of the recent price movements so as to study the conditions that might have resulted in overbought or oversold of the currency. RSI is regarded as overbought when the RSI value is higher than 70 and it is considered as oversold when the RSI value is under 30. These values can be modified based on what fits the security in the best way.\nYou can add these indicators to your chart using the trading software given to you by the Forex Brokers.\nIf you are interested in learning more about forex market price action analysis, you can refer to ‘ What is Price action trading analysis ? ’ and for getting more information about how to trade forex in Sri Lanka, ‘ Introduction to Forex Trading .", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

{"id": "9579", "text": "Psychology is a huge field containing many divisions and subdivisions, each of which contributes to the entirety of the field uniquely. And there are many, many reasons why you would consider taking up a psychology project – it could be for academic reasons (if your school or college mandates that you undertake one), or you can take up a psychology project simply because you’re interested in it and are testing the waters.\nRegardless of the specific circumstances that lead you to take up a psychology project, the information regarding psychology projects will remain the same throughout.\nWhy Do Psychology Projects Matter?\nWhen it comes to developing a deeper understanding of how the human mind functions, psychology projects can go a long way. In fact, these projects are perhaps more in line with the word “experiments” in that they can elaborate more on one aspect of a particular question, thought, or idea, than anything else can. However, not all projects are experiments, as the more theoretical ones, require more reading rather than experimental setups.\nIt would be instructive, then, to keep in mind the core purpose of doing these projects, or experiments – unearthing or discovering specific kinds of information that are relevant to the question being asked beforehand. Therefore, the more practical projects are experimental in nature, while the more theoretical ones help with research.\nWhen discussing from a purely educational standpoint, a lot of basic experiments can serve very well at the school or undergrad level. Then, spending upon where you’re headed in terms of education, you can either take a significantly more theoretical stance in certain psychological schools.\nOr, it can get significantly more experimental, if that’s what ends up working for you. Either way, this list is going to be very useful for you – so read on, no matter what the case is!\nWithout further ado, then, let’s take a look at some theoretical and some practical psychology project ideas!\nPractical Psychology Projects (Experiments)\n1. Is it Possible For People to Feel that they are Being Watched Even When There is no Tangible Evidence Regarding the Same?\nFor this, you can set up experiments to make sure that a person you are communicating with can tell you exactly what they feel when they are either alone or in a crowd. Various types of questionnaires can be set up to get the correct type of data for this, and as and when you find yourself assessing the data, you can understand the concept of interiority much better.\n2. What is the Impact of Color Perception on Physiology?\nThis is an interesting experiment not only because it relates to how the human body processes colors across different senses (from sight to taste to the skin, etc), but also because it lets a student explore neuro-physio-psychological connections all through one experiment!\nMoreover, this can also shed some very interesting light on a disorder like synesthesia, which is perfectly benign as a disorder but has some very interesting consequences. For instance, people have reported that they can taste colors and smell musical notes – it’s all kinds of fascinating!\n3. Can Different Colors Impact Moods Positively or negatively?\nOne of the most researched topics around color perception and color psychology as a whole is how it relates to mood. There is a consensus around the question, and it has developed across the centuries, as these experiments have been conducted both at the university level and beyond that as well. But generally, this is a great experiment to test the waters and see what the processes are like.\n4. Does the Type of Music One Listen to Correlate with One’s Personality?\nYet another commonly studied experiment is one that tries to establish a legitimate correlation between someone’s personality and the type of music that one listens to. Of course, as a general experiment, it gets tough to pin it down, but even when done in focus groups of about 15-20 people each, this experiment can give really insightful results.\n5. Can Different Types of Music Change How a Person Reacts Physiologically?\nContinuing onward with the theme of music, it can also be used in a different way for experiments, to find out whether it has any physiological reactions. It is best not to start with a clean slate here, but rather to have a specific point of inquiry that gets addressed as being negative or positive.\nFor example: can certain types of music calm people down? Or – do certain types of music have the ability to make people’s hearts beat faster? Questions along this line will be helpful.\n6. What is the Best Way to Measure Creative Versus Analytical Thinking?\nThere are many ways to understand as well as to measure creative and analytical thinking. As a student of psychology, you can conduct your own experiment, which will assess whether or not you agree with certain ways of thinking and pose your reasons for said agreement or otherwise.\nEven though this experiment is theoretically basic, it’s precisely that simplicity that allows it to be so diverse in execution! You can take this experiment anywhere you want – depending on the resources you have available and are willing to spend.\n7. Is There Any Correlation Between the Pace of the Movie that One is Watching and the Amount of Food One Eats?\nThis is yet another simple experiment that can demonstrate habit at a subconscious level and can be a great experiment to illustrate the connections between sight and taste, if not among other stimuli, and how a person responds to them.\nYou have to take care here not to conflate correlation with causation, though, since that is a common issue with this experiment in particular. At the experiential level, this experiment illustrates a lot – and the more connections you can make the better it will be for you!\nTheoretical Psychology Projects (Research)\nWhen it comes to theoretical projects, it’s advisable not to directly take up a project, but rather to take a look at the structures that surround the topic you want to approach. And it’s by identifying a line of questioning in a particular field that you can delve deeper into your research area. Because, believe it or not, the more you study, the more your lines of exploration change! So the rule of thumb is to delimit your field first and then begin from there.\nHere are some possible lines of exploration, along with some sample topics:\nThe construction of Identity in sub-urban India\nIdentification with religious sentiments in Texas, USA\nExploring struggles with bisexuality in young adults in Beirut\nUnderstanding homosexuality in myths\nWhat are the effects of domestic violence on women and children?\nDifferent types of authority figures and how they create/solve the conflict\nHow does language function in the human mind?\nIs there any difference in how bi/multi-lingual people approach the world versus monolingual people?\nAre there any essential factors for “creativity” as a form of expression?\nIs there a case for consistency when it comes to creativity – or are they directly opposed?\nAgain, keep in mind that these topics are meant to serve as guides and not as de facto research topics. Make sure to research into these as and when you get started – and then hopefully you’ll be able to get in touch with the part of you that gets excited by psychology and create another question altogether!\nHowever, if these questions haven’t inspired you, read on for some other steps you can take.\nHow Else Can You Get Inspired?\n1. Talk to your Professors and/or Connect With your Peers\nWhether you have professors or not, you can always find some people who are interested in psychology to get in touch with you to create a community of like-minded people. Here, you can discuss your likes and dislikes and work through opposing mentalities and arrive at a more nuanced understanding of different psychological concepts and techniques. This is a sure-shot way of constantly being in the best kind of headspace – it is surely going to pay off, sooner or later!\n2. Explore on your Own\nDiscussions with like-minded folks aside, reading on your own is always a great way to explore ideas that intrigue you and make you feel inspired to learn more! Reading is the foremost way to achieve this, but as the internet has expanded to include multiple ways of content presentation, there are also podcasts and videos that you can rely on! Ultimately, the more you learn, the better – so get started as soon as possible and see how things turn out for you!\n3. Read Contemporary Psychology\nWhen you find out exactly what’s going on in the field you’re participating in, that’s arguably the best kind of stimulation. Because not only do you learn new stuff, you’re also learning new stuff that is literally being discovered during the time that you’re alive – and it renders an additional element of historicity to the events! So, the more you read, the better you will be at facilitating your psychology project ideas – and that’s a guarantee on our part!\nAlso Read: Psychology vs Physiology\nGet Started With Psychology Projects Today!\nNo matter which level you’re on or what your future goals are, you can always benefit from psychology projects and psychology project ideas! They help you keep pushing forward, and putting in that little bit of extra effort everyday will surely take you places. So, get started on a psychology project today, and see where it takes you – it may even change the way you’ve approached psychology so far!", "scores": {"score": 3, "score_transform_1": 5, "score_transform_2": 5, "score_transform_3": 0}}

Avalanche’s AVAX token has also plummeted.\nAvalanche Suffers Amid Lawyer Allegations\nEven if the recent claims that Ava Labs secretly colluded with lawyers to damage other projects are unsubstantiated, they’re still hurting the Avalanche ecosystem.\nGameFi project Trident posted an update in response to the allegations late Sunday, saying it had decided to scrap its plan to launch on Avalanche. “In light of recent news, Trident will not be deploying on Avalanche as previously planned,” the project’s wrote on Twitter, revealing it would instead launch on the Ethereum Layer 2 network Arbitrum.\nIn light of recent news, Trident will not be deploying on Avalanche as previously planned.\nInstead, we take Atlantis to Arbitrum.\nThank you. pic.twitter.com/7UG1GUUdf7\n— Trident Ψ (@TridentDAO) August 28, 2022\nTrident’s update came after the self-described “whistleblower” Crypto Leaks published an August 26 article alleging that Ava Labs had paid off legal firm Roche Freedman to sue Avalanche’s competitors and keep regulators at a distance. The report circulated on Crypto Twitter late Sunday, helped by a now-deleted post from Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao. Ava Labs executives Emin Gün Sirer and Kevin Sekniqi both dismissed the report, with Sirer describing it as “conspiracy theory nonsense.”\nInvestors are also bearing the brunt of the allegations. As is often the case when a project is hit with bad news, Avalanche’s AVAX token tanked over 8% Sunday as the Crypto Leaks article did the rounds. It’s since posted a slight recovery to $19.04, down 4.8% over the past 24 hours.\nThough the veracity of the allegations has been called into question, several crypto commentators have criticized Ava Labs since it surfaced. UpOnly co-host Cobie posted a tweet highlighting how he thinks “biased reporting” and several other points discredit Crypto Leaks, before taking a shot at Ava Labs. “Things that look bad for ava labs… the video lol,” he wrote.\nKyle Roche Breaks Silence on Ava Labs Drama\nWhile Ava Labs has opted against posting an official statement on the allegations, Roche Freedman founding partner Kyle Roche, who appeared in a series of undercover video clips as part of Crypto Leaks’ report, broke his silence on the incident today. “[The report] contains numerous unsourced false statements and illegally obtained, highly edited video clips that are not presented with accurate context,” he wrote.\nRoche alleges that he was interviewed by Christen Ager-Hanssen, an employee of Dfinity founder Dominic Williams. Roche’s firm filed a lawsuit against Dfinity in August 2021. Dfinity is the development team behind Internet Computer, a Layer 1 network that was once among crypto’s most hotly anticipated projects. However, Internet Computer suffered a rapid fall in 2021 after its ICP token plummeted 95% in a matter of weeks, leading to allegations that Dfinity had been “dumping” coins on investors.\nRoche said that while his firm has represented Ava Labs since 2019, the company has had no influence over any lawsuits Roche Freedman has filed. “Statements in the video to the contrary are false, and were obtained through deceptive means, including a deliberate scheme to intoxicate and then exploit me,” Roche wrote. “The statements are highly edited and spliced out of context.”\nRoche didn’t explain his comments about how he helps Ava Labs evade regulatory oversight from the SEC and CFTC, nor did he share details of the compensation Rocheman Freed received for representing Ava Labs.\nNeither Roche Freedman nor Ava Labs responded to Crypto Briefing’s request for comment on the allegations. Crypto Briefing also reached out to Williams and Ager-Hanssen and will update this piece with a comment if they respond.\nDisclosure: At the time of writing, the author of this piece owned ETH and several other cryptocurrencies.", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

John 20:18\nMary Magdalene jumps at Jesus’s commission to “go to his brethren.” Such a prompt response to Jesus’s call to mission comes from a deep impulse, echoing St. Paul’s profession, “The love of Christ impels me” (2 Cor 5:14). Before St. Paul spoke those words, they were embodied in Mary Magdalene’s missionary enthusiasm. She went to the disciples and proclaimed, “I have seen the Lord!” “But these words seemed to them an idle tale” (Luke 24:11). The simple task of sharing the good news was ill-received by many. Perhaps the apostle to the apostles found solace in the few who did believe. John and Jesus’s mother may have been a comfort to her, encouraging her to continue sharing the good news.\nWith the coming of Jesus Christ, the Kingdom of God was sown among the first believers. After Jesus’ resurrection, the early Church remained a small nucleus, pondering the mysteries that had just occurred. They waited with anticipation for the coming of the promised Spirit. Mary was not to miss out on this great gift as the outpouring of the Spirit buoyed up the small remnant and increased the number of Jesus’s followers.\nThey would soon discover that the Kingdom of God had boundaries that expanded through the acceptance of Jesus into their lives and the communion that bound them together under Peter, to whom Jesus entrusted the keys. The disciples were commissioned to go forth and make disciples of all nations (Mt 28:19). Mary Magdalene continued in the spirit of accompanying Jesus and the disciples, playing her part in the building of the Kingdom.\nTraditional stories of Mary Magdalene’s adventures after Jesus’s resurrection cast light on her missionary zeal. Disbelief in the good news would not silence her. She traveled to Rome to speak to Caesar himself. She preached the good news to the Roman court. Providence took her to southern France during the early Christian persecution. At the sight of pagan worshippers, she boldly taught about the one God and Jesus Christ, the Son of God who became man to save all. These traditions contain marks of the Mary Magdalene we encounter in Sacred Scriptures, where she shows courage in her witness to the leaders of the pack. Some laughed and scoffed at her. Others heeded the message and converted, multiplying the disciples wherever she went.\nWhat began as an impulse of love would eventually be tested and forged into virtue, as well as gifted with the spirit of courage. Mary Magdalene was continually formed by divine grace and life circumstances. Isn’t this our own experience? For all the plans and strategies we make, for our attempts to be sagacious in the new evangelization, the Holy Spirit will build the Kingdom through both rejection and acceptance of our efforts to share the good news. Our mission is to be docile to the Spirit and let the winds of courage take us to the corners of our social milieu that are in need of the redemptive message and the extension of God’s Kingdom.\nLord Jesus, make us your courageous missionary disciples so that the good news will arrive to the hearts of all those in need of your saving grace. Make us docile to your promptings and sagacious in the work of evangelizing. Guide us in our efforts to multiply faith-filled disciples and grant strength to all those who are fully dedicated to serving you, that you may reign in the hearts of all and your Kingdom will be extended to the farthest corners of the world. Amen.\nSt. Mary Magdalene, pray for us.\nDid you miss a day? Click HERE to see them all.", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}

{"id": "9641", "text": "Use of data-driven methods to search Electronic Health Records (EHRs) in aid of clinical trial recruitment\nMetadataShow full item record\nRecruiting participants into clinical studies is resource-intensive. However, nearly half of the trials fail to recruit enough participants, which lead to early termination or poor power of a study. Digitisation of health care records has ushered in second use of electronic health records (EHRs). One application is for participant identification and recruitment. Development of advanced analytics has also added more possibility to that end. In this thesis, an evaluation of an EHRs-based recruitment support service is presented first. Following that is a study of the contents of eligibility criteria and its availability in EHRs. A systematic review of advanced analytics applied to EHRs for recruitment purposes is reported after that. Finally, a retrospective study of identifying eligible participants for nine clinical studies from EHRs using case-based reasoning method is presented. It was found that EHRs-based recruitment service might have difficulty in identifying patients with certain symptoms and minor conditions due to lack of access to the full set of health care data. Study on eligibility criteria also corroborated that need to access primary care data and to involve advanced analytics in cohort identification in order to address different types of eligibility criteria. The review included 11 relevant papers and found that most were in-silico studies except for one interventional study. Performances could not be synthesised due to huge differences in experiment set-ups, including trial domain, number of trials used, analysis unit, outcome definition, evaluation method. A study using NLP-incorporated case-based reasoning generated good performance indicated by a relatively comprehensive set of measures. Adaptation of case-based reasoning method to EHRs for patient recruitment in SHARE showed good differentiation performances in seven projects. But it did not perform well when evaluated by information retrieval metrics. The results reflected that structured data alone cannot realise the full potential of the computable method, echoing the findings from the other studies.\nThesis, PhD Doctor of Philosophy\nEmbargo Date: 2027-04-18\nEmbargo Reason: Thesis restricted in accordance with University regulations.

{"id": "9682", "text": "Flow Connectivity in Active Volcanic Areas: Use of Index of Connectivity in the Assessment of Lateral Flow Contribution to Main Streams\nConnectivity analysis is an important geomorphological and hydrologic tool that can be used to identify spaces that are prone to removal of primary sediments which are eventually assimilated into granular flows and related epiclastic processes. Studies of connectivity have been made in various areas, but to date, not in active volcanic areas, where such studies can be very useful due to the constant presence of loose volcanic material easily removed by epiclastic processes. Mobilization of loose pyroclastic sediments can trigger phenomena such as lahars, which are among the most dangerous in nature.\nIn this study, the index of connectivity (IC) (Borselli et al. 2008) was calculated by obtaining a weight coefficient (W) combining two elements: the coefficient C related to the universal soil loss equation and the revised universal soil loss equation (USLE-RUSLE) proposed by Borselli et al. (2008) for areas with vegetation cover or crops, and the roughness index (RI) developed by Cavalli et al. (2013), which characterizes bare soil areas. Combining both methods, we propose a new joint index of connectivity (ICJ) that does not overestimate the degree of connectivity in bare areas, while areas with vegetation cover are characterized based on their wellrecognized hydrologic impedance properties. This methodology may enable better characterization in highly dynamic environments such as active volcanic areas.\nWe also propose a new lateral hydrological efficiency index (LHEI) that increases the ability to identify watersheds that supply major amounts of sediment to main streams in ravines.\nThe application of this methodology in the active volcanic area of Volcán de Colima, the most active volcano in Mexico, is of great importance, because of the constant supply of new pyroclastic material from the top of the edifice, the high dynamicity of geomorphological processes, and the widespread presence of bare soil areas consisting of loose materials easily sourced, or assimilated, into epiclastic processes.\nOrtíz-Rodríguez, A.

{"id": "9715", "text": "The psychedelic voyage\nConsuming magic mushrooms, or any psychedelic substance for that matter, puts one face to face with a perception of themselves – or with a reality which is very different to the one they’ve been living up until that moment. In this sense, the psychedelic experience is unique and cannot be compared with the effects of any non-psychedelic substance or drug. They are literally worlds apart with no point of contact.\nExperience with alcohol, cannabis or cocaine isn’t an adequate benchmark from which you can imagine the meaning of a psychedelic experience. These drugs merely alter your state of consciousness and have no shared focal point – they are completely different to one another. To avoid a frivolous interior voyage which could be scary or disorienting in unimaginable ways, it’s very important to outline this difference.\nAs with any substance or drug, one absolutely must read up on the information regarding quantities and modes of consumption, as well as info on any eventual side-effects an individual might be prone to. Being cognisant of all this is an indispensable step for everyone. Remember that psychedelic substances require more than experience – which only comes with time – and that one must study of course but above all practice.\nRules and experience\nThe inevitable lack of experience that comes with your first few times can be compensated for with the presence of an experienced person to support and guide you. I must emphasise that this is especially important for the first few voyages you’ll undertake. And the reason? It’s not exactly that I think it’s a solution which will address and resolve all eventual problems one could possibly face during a psychedelic trip. These problems are almost always caused by ignoring the basic rules one needs to know and respect prior to consuming any substance.\nSo what is a trip sitter?\nA trip sitter is someone who assists a person during the preparation for a psychedelic experience. They help in the run-up, are present – even if only nearby – during the experience, and (ideally) try to assist during the successive integration phase.\nThe ideal trip sitter must have a good few qualities which, in reality, are not easy to come across. It is this “perfect sitter” one refers to when saying a sitter must be continually “present”, especially during a person’s first few steps into the psychedelic world.\nHow can I find this perfect sitter? The first thing to look for is that this person is a good friend and has a solid groundwork of personal experience in the use of the substance in question. Moreover, they’ll be perceptive enough to understand that being a sitter is more about what not to do than what one should do. Yes, their calm and centred presence is the most desired quality in case one finds oneself in difficulty, but they need to know that there’s more to it than that.\nBut what are the qualities to look for in a trip sitter? There’s experience, as we’ve said, as well as patience, calm and helpfulness. Furthermore, they’ll need to have the trust of the subject they’re watching and know what they’re wanting to gain from the experience. In addition, they’ll know the substance well, be aware of psychological factors, and have reliable powers of observation while maintaining the balance necessary to employ their skills in any difficult situation that may arise. Finally, they’ll have to have ample free time to be present for each phase of the experience, from preparation, to post-trip integration.\nBut that’s not all. Adequate assistance also means being able to resolve a psychotic crisis or deal with a participant who has perhaps become paranoid towards their sitter – or who is maybe even hysterical to the point of being a real danger to themselves and others.\nContaining someone’s psychedelic intemperance is a task which requires physical force and, at times, the help of more than one person. This is the most difficult situation that can occur during a trip – other than those which could occur due to various health problems.\nThe most important step one must take in avoiding problems in this area is, of course, prevention. Indeed, most of the vital work is done before the trip, not during, and in preparation one makes choices to reduce the likelihood of possible problems later. But even if everything has been impeccably prepared, problems can arise all the same. In these cases, beyond the specific measures which are always geared towards avoiding or containing damage towards those present, the sitter must also know how to distinguish between normal symptoms and those which are potentially dangerous for the health and physical wellbeing of the person in question.\nIn case of doubts, the perfect sitter doesn’t hesitate to call the emergency medical services, rather than allowing the situation to result in potential harm (or worse). Naturally, if the sitter themselves is a medical professional, that would make them the best kind of sitter one could ever ask for.\nDo you know someone who has all of these characteristics? I, for one, don’t. You might find some of these requirements in one candidate, but many of the more useful traits are few and far between. We must be pragmatic: the ideal situation is one thing, and looking around to discover that no one you know will be able to be an adequate sitter is another. But maybe, just maybe, the solution is simpler than you might think. The perfect sitter, in reality, does exist – but more on that latter.\nDoes one even need a trip sitter?\nSupport is useful in the absence of experience, but what is absolutely not acceptable is confronting the psychedelic substance without being personally informed prior to the trip. We can hardly delegate to others that which directly concerns us – accountability is an exercise one must practice constantly in all aspects of life.\nThis being said, is a trip sitter absolutely necessary? In my book, I state that it’s better to have one there, and many other resources you’ll find online will concur with this. However, given that the ideal sitter is largely a chimera, what should one do in practice? As always, “work with what you’ve got”. If you have a sitter, use them; otherwise, go it alone. This might seem like an incongruous statement, and it is… but if you think about it, that’s just the way it is.\nNaturally, a sitter is absolutely indispensable for substances with which the subject could have knee-jerk reactions – Salvia Divinorum, for example, DMT or 5-MeO-DMT. The effects of these substances peak very quickly, reaching the height of their intensity immediately – at times, in just a few seconds. Only in these situations does one absolutely require some form of a sitter, as the subject could react in an uncomposed manner or even get up and walk around completely unconscious of their actions, at risk of putting themselves in harm’s way. This could happen in the most “banal” of ways: falling from a window, for instance, or tripping onto a glass table. A sitter will keep you safe from these kinds of incidents; their role in this case is clear and simple enough. And with substances such as Salvia the effects normally only last for less than 10-15 minutes.\nBut if we’re talking about psilocybin mushrooms or LSD, the implications are very different. The quantities are dosable in a way that’s proportionate to the effects, and therefore potential risks are reduced or completely eliminated by simply consuming an adequate amount – i.e. a small quantity. Never, and I mean never, start with a high dose. I have often stated this in my book, and throughout the articles in this blog, but it bears repeating. You could enjoy a less strong effect but in doing so get to understand your personal tolerance level and have some indication of what might be the best dose for your second experience. Excessive doses can cause panic attacks, creating problems for yourself and others around you. The Dutch emergency services are well acquainted with this outcome, as are the country’s citizens, used as they are to tourists who have taken magic truffles knowing nothing of their effects.\nThe trip sitter for your first time\nLet’s suppose you’ve been studying and you’re informed of the general characteristics of magic mushrooms (we are talking about mushrooms here, but this also holds true for any psychedelic substance), and you’ve found a friend you trust who is willing to be your sitter. What might they have to do? If you read up on the topic online, you’ll see that the trip sitter is often referred to as an “expert” who assists one of more people with little or no experience, who must intervene as little as possible, must not have an authoritative approach to the role, and is ready to reassure a struggling participant with just a few words.\nBasically, the sitter will stay in the room, or in the vicinity, and manage a perfectly normal situation. It can only be so if no one has felt special and consumed an excessive quantity. If all is going as it should be, you’ll need the sitter very little and therefore they needn’t be constantly present – if only for the simple reason that I personally don’t think I’d enjoy being observed by someone in an ordinary state of consciousness while I’m tripping. However, it’s also true that it could be nice to have someone to chat with despite the difference in your modes of consciousness. Indeed, if the sitter is a close friend, there is no reason to be particularly anxious.\nA real trip sitter knows the substance and dispenses it correctly to the participant, or participants. They are a known and respected reference for everyone due to their experience and, moreover, they can choose and manage the music, scanning the alternating moods of the participants and acting accordingly. In this ideal situation, if he/she and the tripper are well-prepared, the trip will always go well, devoid of particularly problematic situations.\nThe trip sitter for the experts\nEverything I’ve written up until now is relevant to a sitter who may be accompanying “newbies”. But I must touch upon the slightly different situation of sitting for an experienced person, who’s looking for the presence of an expert friend if only to feel safe in case of unforeseen problems.\nBut why would someone experienced in psychedelics even want a sitter? What are they afraid of? Clarifying and understanding this is very important, because if they’ve done things as they should be done, surely assistance won’t be necessary. Personally, before arriving at my first heroic dose (5 dry grams as prescribed by Terence McKenna – a method you can learn more about in my article on the heroic dose), I had enjoyed many experiences on lower doses in various contexts and personal situations, with the aim of learning how I’d respond to different quantities and Set & Setting variables. I can remember my first ever heroic dose: I was emotional, but not afraid, and someone was with me in the house. Although they were informed that I’d be taking this voyage, they never once entered my room or even worried about me. They would have intervened if needed, but only by my request. And in fact, it never came to that, not on that occasion or on any other.\nWhile having a sitter when you’re experienced seems counterintuitive, it does make a difference to know there’s someone there if you need them, perhaps in the other room or ready to rush over if you call them. Obviously, this role should be agreed upon before any eventual possibility of needing to ask for their help.\nPsychotherapy with psychedelics\nThis is the frontier of psychological therapy, and a practice which has been successfully experimented with in the past (since the ‘50’s), but then forgotten about once these substances were grouped together with more dangerous drugs.\nHaving the support of a medical professional (or a licensed therapist), who is trained in the use of psychedelic substances is ideal of course. In that case, it could be possible to start with an elevated dose and go exploring in the depths of your psyche even without experience – but alas this is prohibited by law and therefore there isn’t much more to say on that. The doctor would prepare you with a few meetings prior to the trip, assist you during the experience and then, in the successive integration period post-trip, help you process anything that emerged during. I would love to see this legalised in order to experience these ideal conditions, but for now it is unfortunately not possible. We must make do with what we have in a situation of illegality with the trip sitter, studying everything we need to know to go forth with peace of mind. The experience can be demanding, but one thing it must always be is safe. This responsibility is above all in the hands of the person having the experience, but the sitter – being an expert – can certainly help resolve any doubts or misunderstandings.\nBefore the trip\nPreparation is paramount: one needs to choose a place, organise it so that it’s comfy and safe, have some water on hand, music, and perhaps masks to rest over the eyes during the initial phase. These are all things the sitter must take care of, or at least oversee. As a rule, the sitter mustn’t consume anything themselves – or so says most literature on the subject – but I don’t necessarily think so. I can’t generalise on this point, but in my opinion the sitter very well can take some of the substance in question. However, this of course depends on how far the sitter will be able to support and help if intervention becomes necessary. Normally, this is perfectly possible if the sitter has consumed a moderate amount – i.e. 3 grams max of dry mushrooms, with an average physical tolerance – though the ideal would be the same quantity that’s been taken by the person they’re assisting, so normally much less than 3 grams. If the sitter has the experience necessary, this quantity will pose no problems. Moreover, it will permit them to be more in tune with the person who is tripping, and provide help (if necessary) that is as empathetic and efficacious as possible.\nNaturally, the sitter who has also consumed a little of the substance will not be able to drive. This rules out the possibility of being able to transport someone somewhere, but no one should need urgent medical help anyway if the sitter and “sitee” have been following the rules. If you really and truly need help, call an ambulance, but again this is unlikely to be necessary with proper preparation.\nWhat preparation exactly? The usual: take a low dose and respect the confines of Set & Setting religiously. Read more on this topic HERE, if you’re not sure what Set & Setting means.\nFear is an unavoidable element of the lead up to an experience, and not just your first. (Read this article, which elaborates on the topic, to learn more). Indeed, fear helps to prevent you from taking the situation lightly. That being said, it can also impede you from letting go when you need to – or, in other words, it can feed any resistance you’re feeling towards the expansion of your inner journey. So inform yourself, and in doing so render the whole thing less mysterious and overall less fearsome than it might initially seem.\nDuring the trip\nMushrooms are potent instruments of introspection. If used in the right way, they can offer visions of yourself and of reality which are truly enthralling, revealing points of view you had never imagined. This “change in perspective” – a somewhat limiting term! – which allows one to comprehend and resolve longstanding questions of great concern. These issues can date back to a person’s infancy, or even earlier than that. What presents itself in this type of introspective trip is not dangerous on its own. Resistance and refusal are what can really hinder the experience, though this challenge will hardly leave one permanently damaged – quite the opposite is true, in fact.\nBut this aspect of a psychedelic trip is touched upon only with doses much stronger than those recommended to people starting out, so it’s not the kind of thing you’ll have to confront in the presence of a sitter. Certain explorations you take with a therapist – although remember this is not legal – or alone – which isn’t legal either…\nTransformative trips can be undertaken with others too, but it’s a little harder as Set & Setting becomes more complicated. I explore this subject a lot further in my book, where you’ll find tens of pages dedicated to the ceremonial aspect of tripping with others. There is a special Set & Setting to tackle the greatest number of variables present in an intense group experience. The high intensity, obtained by upping the dose, requires a ceremonial Set & Setting, because it functions in a way that’s more adapted to the depths one reaches with higher doses. A sitter isn’t necessarily required here either, if not for having somebody available in case you come across real problems during the experience. However, it’s an intervention I’d advise against asking for: the difficulties one confronts during an interior trip are mental and emotional, but rarely physical. This will always hold true, given that you’ve respected the appropriate cardiovascular contraindications for heart problems and epilepsy. Therefore, resolving the difficulties you meet alone is a precious lesson which can change you profoundly.\nA psychedelic experience is always an unknown. You’ll never know how it’s going to go, but trusting the fungus will allow you to stay cognisant of whatever you’re going to feel will be for your benefit, even in the most extreme of experiences.\nA special problem\nThere is a certain problem which can present itself during a trip. It’s very important to know about because it can cause problems, not to mention some serious consequences. Apart from the question of one’s physical health, which one can experience issues with in unexpected ways, exists the possibility that you’ve taken mushrooms and at a certain point forget you’ve taken them and actually also forget that you’re in a psychedelic experience at all. To learn more on this, take a look at this article, where you’ll find information on how to avoid finding yourself in a decidedly tricky situation.\nAfter the trip\nRight at the end of the experience is the best moment to begin integration. Indeed, memories one might completely forget after one night of sleep are still fresh, a little like a dream one recalls only in the moments after waking.\nAt this point, the sitter can be of help because they’ve brought, for example, some paper and coloured pencils. Or they can facilitate the sharing of experiences if there are several participants present. Additionally, they can provide drinks and food to help bring the particepant/s back to the normal world.\nIt often happens that hearing someone recount their experience can help one understand one’s own. Together with the sitter and any other participants that may be there, taking some time for sharing and talking is well worth it. Then you can even write things down, or draw which is an excellent way to solidify what has happened. This is of great importance because information from your trip can be useful in daily life.\n(don’t forget to read the WARNINGS here)\nIf you enjoyed the post and found it useful, please buy me a coffee!", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}
{"id": "9718", "text": "by Edwina G. Richardson-Mendelson, Ronald Richter and Juanita Bing Newton\nin the New York Daily News\nThe pandemic has accelerated and emphasized deep flaws in New York State’s justice system. Most glaringly, it has thrown a spotlight on how the state’s antiquated and complex trial court system puts our most vulnerable citizens at a terrible disadvantage in their pursuit of fair, speedy and equal access to justice.\nNew York has a Revolutionary War-era network of trial courts — no less than 11. No state has nearly as many. It is the most archaic, complex and bureaucratic justice system in the nation, a wasteful and balkanized setup that creates radically different experiences for litigants depending on their racial, economic and geographic backgrounds, and costs everyone time and money.\nIt must be fixed, and now is the time. The national drive toward criminal justice reform creates the ideal atmosphere for our effort to reform New York’s courts, both criminal and civil.\nReforming our court system should be grounded on four core principles:\n- promoting equal access to justice for all people;\n- increasing efficiency and reducing costs for low-income New Yorkers;\n- accelerating the ongoing diversification of our judiciary and leaders of our court system, and\n- opening greater opportunities for judges to move up the ranks.\nAs it stands now, certain segments of our court system — such as the commercial division of the state Supreme Court, the highest trial court — run so efficiently and professionally that they are respected national models.\nBut other courts, such as Family Court, are plagued by a lack of sufficient numbers of both judges and non-judicial personnel, with lawsuits delayed for months and sometimes for years, resulting in trauma to children and families. This inequality of justice is worse now, with the commercial division humming along relatively smoothly during the pandemic, while delays in Family Court have worsened.\nA similar scenario threatens to play out in Housing Court, where the expected soon-to-expire eviction ban promises to unleash a flood of cases.\nFor generations, reforming and streamlining New York’s courts has been a priority for those who fight for equal access to justice. Again and again, the dream has run aground on the shoals of lethargy, bureaucracy and resistance from powerful factions determined to protect the status quo.\nThe lack of action enshrines a two-tiered system where relatively affluent litigants can move through the system much faster than New Yorkers who are facing a family crisis or domestic abuse. And it is rife with absurdities.\nImagine a woman seeking a divorce after her husband has been arrested for beating her; he now refuses to pay child support and demands custody of their children. To resolve this dispute, she will need to go to three different courts — Criminal, Supreme and Family. Many not familiar with our system are stunned to learn, for example, that despite a year of litigation over child custody in Family Court, the woman would have to bring a separate divorce case before a different judge in the Supreme Court.\nOr imagine the driver who is rear-ended by a drunk driver on a state road that was improperly marked. He or she will need to not only deal with Criminal Court, but with the Court of Claims — which exists solely for the purpose of settling suits involving the state — as well as the Supreme Court, which resolves damage suits between private citizens.\nThis can be fixed, but it won’t be easy, and it will take time and steely determination. Once we push forward, money will be saved — and the imbalances among those who are properly served will eventually lessen.\nTo begin with, we must replace our 11 trial courts with a Supreme Court and a Municipal Court. All the existing courts, other than the upstate town and village courts, would become divisions of these two larger entities, with the Family Court becoming a division of the Supreme Court, allowing for smooth coordination and streamlined processes for all members of society. California and New Jersey, among other states, have successfully instituted such reforms.\nThe streamlining will have a critical secondary benefit. New York State’s judiciary has become more diverse in recent years, at least downstate. Expanding the Supreme Court will create more opportunities for jurists to move up the judicial ranks and greatly increase the opportunity for advancing statewide diversity.\nFor this to happen, both houses of the Legislature will have to approve an amendment to the state Constitution during the 2022 and 2023 sessions, to be followed by a public referendum approving the amendment by voters. This can and must be a central focus in Albany’s drive for overall justice reform.\nRichardson-Mendelson is deputy chief administrative judge for justice initiatives in the NYS Unified Court System, Richter is a former New York City Family Court judge and former commissioner of New York City’s Administration for Children’s Services, and Bing Newton is a former dean of the Judicial Institute.", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}

{"id": "9810", "text": "Introduction: Scott and Trevor are back together to record Episode 17, this time at the FCC Bar and Restaurant in Phnom Penh, Cambodia. Trevor introduces the episode by explaining that Scott and he are no strangers to the nightlife scene. In fact, while he only devotes a portion of his travel writing to nightlife venues, people seem to think that he is an expert on every place to go for a drink in every destination he’s ever been. So as not to disappoint his fans, he has tried to keep on top of the scene in every area he hangs out in and Scott has been an indispensable resource in this regard.\nScott has always thought you haven’t really experienced a country until you’ve had at least a couple drinks\nthere. When you hit bars and spend some time in them, you also meet some of the most colorful locals around, get insider info, and usually end up having a hell of a time. After describing their current location, the FCC, which is one of the watering holes on their list, Trevor explains that on this episode they will be sharing some of their favorite watering holes throughout the region, some well known, some well off the beaten path, but all a ton of fun to enjoy tilting glasses or bottles in.\nCambodia: Although he feels it’s arguably the most popular meeting point, Happy Hour venue, and riverside restaurant in Phnom Penh, The FCC is, according to Trevor, like the ex-girlfriend you don’t like anymore but can’t say no to when she booty calls you. The FCC occupies the 2nd and 3rd floors of a river-facing building along Sisowath Quay in the heart of the tourist district of Phnom Penh and Scott agrees that it is, in itself, a major tourist destination, with great ambience, a tasty menu, historical cache, nice views of the riverfront, and a pretty decent menu. They then talk about the building’s history and its place in film and Cambodian history, elements that add to the ambience.\nThailand: Trevor thinks they could fill a few episodes purely on Bangkok watering holes but thought they could touch on a few favorites. The first is Cheap Charlies. Scott calls Cheap Charlies a legendary watering hole, giving a bit of history of the bar started by Sathit and his brother (now deceased) Charlie around 20 years ago. Scott heard that drinks started at 30 baht (less than $1) back in the day and are now 70 baht (just over $2). There are always people there and it’s got a great dive bar atmosphere: kitsch, classic rock, and a diverse and always large crowd. Trevor agrees that it’s a bit of an open-air dive bar.\nTrevor decides to stay in the area around Sukhumvit 11, where Cheap Charlies is located, and picks a bar that was mentioned on an earlier episode with Greg Jorgensen: Check Inn 99. Scott states that Check Inn 99 is on the bizarre end of the scale, reminding him of the Regal Beagle from TV’s Three’s Company with a tiki bar vibe. He describes it as featuring a small waterfall with some aging hostesses and waiters in white shirts and bowties – a true throwback. Trevor says he once recently saw the waiters dressed in colorful dinosaur costumes and talks about how the bar, which has been around for 50 years – once hosting Bob Hope – has remained relevant to the nightlife scene by featuring the Vagina Monologues and screening The Rocky Horror Picture Show. Scott reminds us of Greg’s comment that the building was the city’s first ice factory back in the day.\nBefore moving on from Sukhumvit 11, Trevor mentions Above Eleven at the Frasier Suites Hotel as one of Bangkok’s best rooftop bars. Scott states that you need to dress up for Above Eleven more so than at Cheap Charlies, and the two talk about a few other Bangkok rooftop bars they like, including Moon Bar/Vertigo at the Banyan Tree Hotel, and one they don’t: Sirocco at State Tower.\nScott then takes us north to Chiang Rai, where he talks about one of his favorite watering holes: Teepee\nBar. Scott enjoys the bar not only for its drinks but also for the company of the proprietor, Too, who has run the bar for over 20 years. Scott describes Too as a true hippie character and very kind soul. He takes in friends to work for a while, helps with food, etc, and there are always some ‘interesting’ people in his bar. After 19 years near the Night Bazaar, Too had to relocate a few blocks away but Scott feels that he has done a remarkable job of recreating the magic with bikes hanging from the ceiling, odd things here and there, and great music – from Kenny Rogers, to Led Zeppelin and everything in between: you never know what you’ll hear.\nBali: Trevor explains that it was hard to pick his favorite watering holes in Bali as the island has such a sophisticated and diverse nightlife scene. One of his favorites, for certain however, is Potato Head Beach Club in Petitenget/North Seminyak, which he describes as the ultimate high-society-meets-hipster beach bar/restaurant. Potato Head is everything you could want in a single venue, he explains, and while most are impressed by Potato Head’s design before they even set foot in the building, Trevor says that he mostly enjoys sunset cocktails at the beachfront pool bar.\nHe then talks about the scene down by Uluwatu surf break on the Bukit peninsula, where a number of bars and restaurants are perched on the cliff-side overlooking the waves. Trevor likes to start with post surf, pre-sunset beers at Dephi Rock Bar, the nearest bar to the water, for its cold drinks, inexpensive food, and spectacular view. Come sunset, especially on Sundays, he then head ups the hill to Single Fin, the premier surfer bar overlooking the Uluwatu line up. Single Fin is a surf shop and cafe as well as the official party venue for surf contests held at the world-famous break.\nNepal: Scott states that while there are a bunch of great venues to visit in Kathmandu, Jazz Upstairs is the spot that stands out most in his mind. Scott says that the bar is run by a man named Chudrup, and that Jazz Upstairs was originally quite a rough-around-the edges-spot on Lazimpat. Yet, he explains, it attracts a host of musicians, and anyone who lives in Kathmandu for a couple months will end up there, including legendary musician Sting, who played there once. He describes it as super cozy and that it offers great drinks, including some of the best momos, Nepali/Chinese dumplings, he’s ever had. While the bar has recently moved to a new location after the original building was torn down, he’s has heard that the new venue has really come into its own. He says the owner is also one of the drivers behind the yearly Jazzmandu festival, which generally takes place in October or November, and there’s a gig or two at the joint during the festivities.\nLaos: Scott introduces Utopia in Luang Prabang, Laos as one of the all-around most well rounded bars he’s seen.\nTrevor first went there with Derek, who founded the bar, before Derek’s vision became reality. They went to an overgrown lot overlooking the river and as they walked around he said, here’s where the volleyball court is going to go, there’s going to be the bar and the deck overlooking the river will be.\nWhen Trevor went back a couple years later it looked exactly as Derek had envisioned it and he thinks the bar is now so cool. Totally tropical chic: literally utopia. Scott explains that the bar is laid back, groovy, and welcoming. It offers a great view of the river below from multiple decks, the beach volleyball court Trevor mentioned, pirate’s nest, morning yoga classes, pillows to lie down on, and great food. Scott says that Rob, the owner at the time of his visit, is a top guy. He ended up here two or three times in three days.\nVietnam: Trevor and Scott wrap up this episode talking about another place they both enjoy: Cafe Zoom in Ho Chi Minh City. Run by Steve, who also operates Vespa tours of the city, Zoom has a great corner side location on the fringe of the backpacker area, Bui Vien. Scott says Steve is a great source of information about the city and enjoys sitting on lawn chairs on the sidewalk in front of the bar watching the city’s motorcyles buzz by. Trevor recalls chatting with Steve who sent out for outstanding food from a nearby street restaurant.\nScott believes they could do a half dozen more episodes about their favorite bars but reminds listeners that these are long-standing favorites that visitors could easily find and enjoy checking out. Trevor agrees that many places come and go so quickly and some he would rather simply keep to himself. Scott then asks Trevor to give us his favorite of these favorites and a bit about that experience. Trevor says he’s spent more time more recently at Potato Head in Bali and enjoys it around sunset, when he can recruit a team of tourists to join him for a night of eating and drinking. Scott goes with Teepee Bar around 9:30pm, when it’s filled predominantly with locals, he can relax and enjoy an old music concert or have an easy conversation with Too.\nOur Sponsor: Episode 17 is brought to you by Beervana.

{"id": "9845", "text": "With the Anita Mui Tribute Festival fast coming to a close, The Band Post speaks to arrangers Ong Jiin Joo and Yap Sin Yee, as well as soloist Samuel Phua on their thoughts about the music of the finale concert this Saturday, presented by Philharmonic Wind Orchestra (PWO).\nCover Photo: Adrian Cheong, Ong Jiin Joo, Samuel Phua and Yap Sin Yee (from left to right)\nLet’s talk about the pieces you are arranging.\nI think what ended up on my plate were the faster pieces; the ones that we usually dance to rather than sing. I mean, you can sing along too, but usually it’s a dance, and Anita Mui is known for not just her vocal prowess, but also this very big stage presence while dancing.\nIn many ways when I was a kid, I noticed Anita Mui to be a bit like the Lady Gaga of that time. That’s because I also grew up in a more Chinese pop kind of environment, whether it’s Cantonese music or Chinese music. She fills that role basically of a “showgirl”, and those are the pieces that I ended up arranging for this concert.\nI realised that it’s actually quite challenging, because we need to ensure that fans of Anita continue to recognise the songs, especially since these fans are diehard fans from 20 or 30 years ago, so the pieces needed to have specific flavours. The outcome doesn’t always conform to the nice or “baroque” sound, but once the music starts, you’d know it’s Anita Mui. That, I think, is her success.\nAnita is probably the only one that does the so-called “cheesy” rock in a distinctive style. So on one hand I have arranged the pieces to appeal to the fans, but at the same time, I have to keep the band medium in mind as well. There’s also that segment of the audience that we want to make sure not to alienate, so that they continue to be accepting of this new music they’re probably hearing for the first time. A lot of those who are coming to the concert may be band people, but they are not of the generation of people like us who know Anita Mui or Cantonese pop well. And that’s where we struggle for this particular project.\nIt’s definitely not a free-for-all, write whatever you want, kind of thing, but it’s more of a reminiscence of this famous person. So it can have a much longer impact into the future because she has done a lot of interesting and good work, for that era and for people of that era, especially to those people who also speak and understand Cantonese.\nSo would you consider yourself an Anita fan?\nNo, not like Adrian, of course; he’s in another universe.\nYou don’t ask a classical musician if he or she was a Beethoven fan, but they’d have to reckon with it. I think it’s the same thing: if you study the Mandopop, Cantopop era of the ’70s, ’80s, ’90s into the new century, you would know about Anita Mui. I mean, it’s impossible not to know about her, her music and her body of work.\nBecause, again, the word we always use is “prolific”. She’s so prolific in acting, singing and dancing, she has done so much work, but sadly only really recognised in Asia. She’s one of those that did not actually spill over to the Western world, unlike these days, where Asian artists also cross over to the Western world and reach out to the audience there.\nI would not call myself a fan, but I mean, I have to reckon with what she is.\nEver since I was still a kid, when a CD player was a new thing where we were growing up, my mum went to a Pasar Malam (night market) and brought back my very first CD. It was a random set of music but it already has Anita singing on one of the tracks. We didn’t programme that particular song because she was not the original singer, but that’s already from the very first CD I ever heard. And she’s been present in my life all the way.\nWhat are some of the challenges of arranging the music, especially the ones featuring vocalists?\nWhat was most interesting was the singer selection.\nI grew up thinking Anita Mui was a tenor-range female singer. It’s true, her voice is quite low, but she just had a wide range. In a lot of her songs, her deep, dark voice is in the tenor range. And that was the sound that we were looking for.\nWhen we looked for singers, we listened to a few and shortlisted them. Zita Tse was one of those that came across as very interesting, very close to the sound we were looking for.\nThe usual challenge of arranging for singers in our concert band medium is that a lot of wind instruments don’t really blend very well with the vocals. Generally, strings and piano would blend a bit better. Arrangers will usually struggle to make sure that we don’t end up destroying the iconic parts of what the song was, but also bringing out the flair at the same time. Fortunately or unfortunately, I didn’t have to work that much as singers this round as we gave the chance to some of the younger arrangers.\nI had the liberty of actually transcribing more of the complete sound of what people remember of Anita’s music for, which includes not just the melody, but also things like electric guitar riffs, very jumpy bass guitar lines, and things like that which I think even the band struggles to understand at first. The drummer, for example, had to listen to the music over and over again to get the original groove. It’s a very ’80s digital sound in many ways.\nApart from arranging music, you have also helped with curating the music for the concert. Could you talk more about that experience?\nIt’s a lot of hard work but I would give the credit to Adrian.\nWe have enjoyed a great collaboration over decades. This time, I believe, is the first time where we had to curate an entire concert and I realised that Adrian has an interesting foresight.\nNormally, when you just listen to the MP3, a song might feel like some very boring, very old, very arcane, and probably not-so-famous piece. However, he will say, this is important from a musicologist’s standpoint; this has to come before that or that needs to come before this. In many ways, his direction has been very good. It really saves a lot of time, because the last thing we want is to become a musicologist ourselves and actually listen to hundreds and hundreds of works to even begin selecting a representative set of music for a concert like this, where what we want are the highlights.\nI would say that mostly what I do is to clarify what the essence of a song is. In some songs, the famous part is in the chorus, or the interlude, or the words. In other songs, for example, we cannot omit the first bar because the first bar is what gets people excited. I think those are the things that we did a lot of research on, even asking some of the older folks: if I give you these four notes, do you know what song this is? Then we had to go and figure out whether those motifs are important.\nSo that’s usually what we do. Because when we highlight, we also take on the responsibility of ensuring that what we highlight is indeed iconic. Hopefully, if the concept is successful, and we put it on YouTube, it becomes its own next wave of having the music live on. You want the parts that really were iconic of that era to live on. In this way, we are essentially curating the classical music of this era for our next generation.\nDo you have any favourites?\nNo, but I enjoyed the pieces that mostly revolve around her being a “bad girl”; and these are also the pieces I feel are really iconic because it reminds me of some of the social issues of the era, and during my own youth. Perhaps not in Singapore, but definitely around Asia.\nShe captured our imagination with her music. For good or for bad, people actually want to dance to her music. And that’s what a lot of my own high school experience was like.\nAt that time, we had no internet, and no entertainment. When we found ourselves at venues where music was played, there were Western songs like Barbie Girl, but on the Cantonese side, it’s mostly Anita Mui. I wouldn’t say I have any favourite songs, but her music really reminded me a lot about my childhood and choices I made in life.\nWhen I hear Anita Mui’s music, it reminds me of certain friends I had, and the struggle of finding our identity as a young kid. This music played a huge deal in our lives.\nHave you heard of Anita Mui before coming onboard this project? (Samuel was born in 1997)\nOkay, to be honest, I didn’t really know of Anita Mui until Adrian asked me if I would play for the show. So then I went to do my research on her. Then I started listening to all her albums, but I have to admit I don’t speak Cantonese, so when I was listening to her songs, it’s really just trying to understand the inflection of how she speaks. Of course, for 女人心 (A Woman’s Heart), I know the lyrics inside out. It’s been on the Spotify playlist that I’ve been listening to, and it is both sad and touching at the same time.\nSo how did this arrangement with the piece come about?\nI’m playing the saxophone solo with the band. It was arranged by Germaine Goh and she is a good friend of mine. So what I did was to propose a composer-arranger that PWO can potentially work with, and it helps that I have recorded and performed quite a number of Singaporean works.\nWhat Germaine did was she took the song, which was in a very standardised format of verse-chorus-verse-chorus, and turned it into a theme-and-variation kind of work, where I play what Anita sings and then also a very showy solo. The piece itself is such an expressive song and the showy variation that Germaine wrote fits really well into the piece. In the middle of this arrangement, there’s a whole saxophone solo that is spun off from the introduction of the song. The whole band finally comes back together for a super grand ending.\nWhen you look at the lyrics of the song, it’s a little bit sad. At the end of the song, she says that she is just an ordinary person, but the piece showcased that she is such a beautiful singer and it ends off so grandly. And that is really interesting, because she’s such a talented, multi-faceted artist. She’s a singer and she’s also an actor, and really, nobody is nearly as good as her.\n女人心 (A Woman’s Heart) is such a melodious piece and it works really well on the saxophone. It’s been such a fun experience learning more about Anita’s life, and I am so intrigued that I would want to watch her movies to learn even more about her.\nCould you also share your challenges that you face while rehearsing the piece?\nOkay, so as a saxophonist, when we play songs, one thing that we have to be very careful about is how to look at the music and go about it as an instrumentalist.\nWhat I mean by that is, how do we put all the vocal inflections that she does into the notes we see, and to fit that into the words that she sings. So a lot of times it’s about trying to mimic what she does in a way that cannot be notated, and that’s why it took a lot of time for me to learn this piece. I’m quite obsessive and I would actually listen to how she sings phrase by phrase and then try to match the way I play to how she would vocalise each and every single word.\nThe Cantonese language has seven different tones, more than the Chinese language which only has four. So to a certain extent, a lot of the research went into trying to understand how she makes those inflections and to take as much of that into the saxophone as possible. But then, of course, once you go on stage, you might forget, and it cannot be at the forefront of your mind. You just want to take away all these things and just go with the flow. I guess it’s about really trying to analyse what she does, only to absorb it to a point where after that you have to just do it without thinking about it.\nUnfortunately, in this process, I’ve not been able to learn Cantonese or sing the song myself. I wish there was a Cantonese teacher to assist me with this. A few years back, when I did the Tosca Fantasy with PWO, I actually went to a German teacher and learned how to vocalise the different German words. That really played a big part in how I interpreted Tosca as a German work.\nIn the end, you really just have to use your ear and try to figure out where the hard and soft consonants are, and to figure out how to articulate the whole piece. Do we actually have to go through all this? No, but it’s a nice and important thing that we should do when we approach any song. I wouldn’t say that this is a challenge – it’s just an additional thing that we have to do. It’s not like a saxophone concerto where the notes are written out clearly for the soloist.\nWhat are some of your memories about Anita Mui?\nMy memory of Anita Mui is mostly as an actress because I saw her in the Hong Kong films. I am not really a big fan as I only see her sporadically in some films. Since I don’t speak Cantonese, I’m not also very into her songs, except for her most famous Chinese song, which is 亲密爱人 (My Dear Love), which I also arranged.\nIt was only until Adrian Cheong started designing the concert that I got myself more interested in her life story. I even watched a show about her titled Anita on Disney+, and it basically summarised her life. She’s just quite amazing as an artist and also in terms of her personality. And that was how I learned more about her in her life and her music.\nDo you have to do your own research and listen to other songs a couple of times before you could start writing?\nYes, I had to listen to the rest of the songs, and get acquainted with them. Some of them have different versions, like one of them is a theme from the movie “Days of Being Wild” (阿飞正传) which I didn’t watch, but somehow know of its existence. That particular song has an original version but she redid it in her own style, so there are two versions. I also had to reference and try to come up with something that will work well for the band.\nThis is also not the first time writing for vocalists. Do you research Zita’s vocal range before you incorporate her into your songs?\nYes, when writing for singers, you have to know at least the vocal range, what key they want to sing in, and also a bit of the quality of their voice. Sometimes also when I arrange, I also have to ensure that the music is able to suit different types of voice qualities to use it with another singer; though it doesn’t happen very often. For this concert, I did listen to some of the clips of Zita singing, and amazingly, she sounds very close to Anita Mui, so that made it a bit easier for us.\nWere there any other challenges that you faced when being asked to arrange the music?\nI think besides arranging, Adrian, Jiin Joo and I also planned the other arrangements in this concert so there’s some variety to the style of the music. I think I wouldn’t really say it was a challenge, but we had to work with many parties to try to get all the scores in on time.\nActually, I was looking forward to this pop concert. We haven’t had such a pop concert in a few years. It’s fun because I like writing for the band and transcribing or transforming a pop song into something for the band. I find this quite enjoyable.\nSo other than arranging music, did you also have to curate the repertoire and order of pieces?\nYes both Jiin Joo and I were involved but most of the credit goes to Adrian. We just try to help him with it, and also liaise with some of the other arrangers to make sure they know where their part fits into the concert, and communicate any specific instructions. So Gordon Tan wrote for the other singer, Novabelle Ng, and Germaine Goh and Robbie Say wrote for soloists Samuel Phua and Bian Tong respectively.\nIs there a piece that you are looking forward to performing, or one that you think the audience will enjoy most?\nThere are many songs, and there’s this one called Remembrance Medley arranged by Robbie. At first I didn’t really go and listen to all of them until I started arranging some of the music, and then rehearsals started and I’m playing in the band, and I found I really like Robbie’s piece for the Dizi solo. I think the way he did it was very nice; he transformed the song into a version that sounds more like a symphony and that was quite cool.\nFinally, do you have anything to add for the audience?\nI hope that this will be a good concert. I thought it was a very good programme, and it’s also nice that it’s the first time in a few years that we’re doing a pop concert; one that is highly curated and very specialised.\nThis concert is about Anita Mui and her life and it’s going to be very exciting because I think Adrian also has a big plan for the emcee, who will be narrating the show and telling the audience about Anita’s life. It will be a very promising concert, and I hope we can do more such concerts in future.\nLimited tickets are still available for LEGEND: Anita Mui Tribute Concert happening this Saturday at 7.30pm at Esplanade Concert Hall.\nGet yours now at https://sg.bookmyshow.com/events/ANITAMUI", "scores": {"score": 1, "score_transform_1": 2, "score_transform_2": 2, "score_transform_3": 1}}
{"id": "9847", "text": "Of 172 cases on day six 20 cases are from flu clinics, 62 from mass screening and 32 from community surveillance with 58 close contact cases\nWithin the last nine days of the lockdown that first started in Thimphu there has been a total of 172 local transmission cases averaging at the rate of 19 cases a day. Bhutan now also has 178 active cases with 623 total cases.\nDay six of the lockdown on 25th December saw the biggest spike in cases with a record 38 cases of which 29 cases were in Thimphu.\nMass screening cases\nAround 10,000 have been tested in Thimphu for the mass screening and so far 62 cases have come up in Dechencholing, Changangkha, Chang Jalu, Motithang, Kabesa, Upper Dechencholing, Debsi and Nyinzergang.\nThe Health Minister Dasho Dechen Wangmo earlier said that a sweep was also done to test everyone in Dechencholing given the high cases there.\nShe tried to assuage concerns saying that of the many mass testing cases quite a few had some form of interaction with earlier positive cases.\nHowever, such a high number of mass screening cases spread all over Thimphu with and no direct link to positive cases shows that Thimphu has a significant level of Community Transmission.\nThe magnitude of the problem was reflected in a statement by the Prime Minister on day five of the lockdown. He said, “Until now, our focus was to prevent COVID-19 from entering into the country. After almost nine months, it is now here in our communities. Rampant local transmission of coronavirus is evident.”\nThe Health Minister on the same day said that epidemiologically the current Thimphu and past Phuentsholing outbreaks are different.\nShe said in Phuentsholing the virus originated from the Mini Dry Port and since the workers were staying together it spread from there.\nIn the case of Thimphu it is community transmission as cases are coming from the community.\nShe said the danger in Thimphu is more as it is the capital city and has a large population with a lot of travel and interaction. She said it is easier for the virus to spread in Thimphu.\nIn response to questions by The Bhutanese the Technical Advisory Group (TAG) of the MoH said, “Our initial assessment is that the disease is at its acute state of transmission. However, it is difficult to say since it’s been only a few days since the declaration of lockdown.\nUntil day two of the lockdown the original 25-year-old girl and her family in Chubachu and their close contacts and those tested in the surrounding community comprised of 21 local cases and the term being used for them was a cluster infection meaning an infection within a small area.\nHowever, the Prime Minister on day three of the lockdown on 22nd December announced a national lockdown when it became clear that there were cases coming up which had no link to the Chubachu cases.\nThe Prime Minister announced the national lockdown on day 3 citing the cases from flu clinics with Thimphu reporting 5 cases from flu clinics, Paro saw 3 flu clinic cases and Lhamoizingkha in Dagana saw 1 case from a flu clinic.\nHe said these cases show the presence of local transmission and the lockdown will enable the authorities to find out the extent of transmission with the community.\nThe detection of these flu clinic cases was significant in two ways.\nFirstly, it showed that since these cases have no link to the Chubachu cluster there could be other hotspots in Thimphu and secondly cases coming up in flu clinics outside Thimphu showed the presence of the virus in other Dzongkhags.\nFlu clinic cases like mass screening cases are significant as in they are not the result of any contact tracing or even community surveillance by the MoH in a suspected area, but are people simply turning up at the flu clinic randomly.\nThis means that flu clinic cases are outside the radar of the MoH and indicates a wider spread of the virus and could end up revealing up a lot more cases.\nTo get an idea of how potent a flu clinic case is, the first case that started the whole lockdown and discovery of several other cases was from a flu clinic.\nSecondly, the Paro flu clinic case of a mother and daughter in Shabha high school lead to 15 more cases being discovered in the same school.\nHowever, the situation continued to get worse as on a day after the national lockdown was announced on day 4 there were three more flu clinic cases in Thimphu and 1 flu clinic case all the way in Bumthang showing the virus had already travelled all the way to central Bhutan.\nAs of day 5 of the lockdown 5 cases came up from the flu clinic in Thimphu, a development which would have sent an inward groan within the contact and tracing teams of the MoH.\nOf the 172 local cases so far there are 20 cases from flu clinics with 15 from Thimphu, 3 from Paro, 1 from Bumthang and 1 from Lhamoizingkha.\nThe challenge of flu cases can be seen in the Phuentsholing outbreak in August this year when the MoH was okay as long as it could connect the large number of cases either to the Mini Dry Port or even the DANTAK camp but there would be a tizzy when even a single flu clinic case would come up. Even in the case of one lady who was found through a flu case the MoH then said it may have to do with the fact that she stayed near the MDP.\nHowever, the big challenge now is that just within day nine of the lockdown there are 20 flu clinic cases mainly in Thimphu but also spread across a wide geographical area of Lhamoizingkha in the south, Bumthang in the west and also neighboring Paro.\nBeyond that close contact cases have been detected now in Punakha, Haa, Trongsa and Wangdue too making it an 8 Dzongkhag affair.\nAs of Saturday 9,526 patients were screened at Flu clinics across the country.\nLyonpo said that in flu clinics most of the visitors are from Thimphu while the number is lower in other Dzongkhags.\nThe Prime Minister said that one comfort in the flu clinic cases is that most of them could be somehow linked to the active cases (though not directly and conclusively).\nCommunity Surveillance cases and Close Contacts\nHowever, apart from mass screening and flu clinics cases the other category that is worrying is community surveillance cases. A community surveillance is the MoH doing a survey of all the people in a particular area where a case has emerged.\nTill date Bhutan has 32 cases from community surveillance of which 17 are in Thimphu and 15 are in Paro.\nThe final category are the close contacts or those people who came into direct contact with the positive cases and these are 58 in number.\nLyonpo said that people must be getting scared with the numbers going up like this but she said that they are doing a lot of tests and so the numbers are high. She said the figures will keep increasing in the next 7 to 8 days as more tests are done.\n“However, if we strictly observe the lockdown then the numbers will not go up much after 14 days except for one or two cases. But if the lockdown is not observed well then the numbers will keep going up after day 14 too. We can break the transmission by following the lockdown well,” said Lyonpo.\nThe assessment of the MoH right now is that the outbreak or community transmission is within Thimphu and Paro with the few cases in the other Dzongkhags being linked to either Thimphu or Paro.\nMessage from The Bhutanese\nYou are reading this article for free on the website but it is almost three days after it has been published.

{"id": "9904", "text": "Money is a highly emotional component within the majority of intimate relationships. Many divorcing couples cite money as the reason for the divorce, right up there with infidelity and physical or emotional abuse. What are the emotional components of money and how do we help couples navigate these stormy waters?\nMoney is part of our attachment history. By attachment, I mean our emotional bonds to the people in our lives. From the day we are born to the day we die, we yearn for close emotional bonds that help us feel safe and known. Our feelings about money are often woven into our emotional connection with our parents and our relationship with safety and stability.\nAs children, our parents modeled for us how to feel about money. When you were a child, if your parents were scared about making ends meet, chances are you developed a sense of fear and even shame around the lack of money in your family. To you, “enough” money may represent safety and security on a deep emotional level. A lack of money or the threat of loosing it may cause you great anxiety and shame.\nOn the other hand, if money was abundant in your house while you were growing up, you may not have developed a healthy respect for money or a fear of loosing it. As a result you may spend it without concern. Money’s emotional hold on you is less about fear than about entitlement causing you to spend it too freely or invest it unwisely.\nMoney has great meaning to us culturally as well. Money means power, status and even greater longevity. The truth is the top 1% enjoys better education, better access to health care, leading to longer lives, and better opportunities over time. Generationally the differences of the haves and have-nots have never been greater and are in fact widening. Epigenetically, or the expression of our genes over generations, science is proving that our higher socioeconomic level is correlated with less stress leading to less heart disease, less hypertension and less diabetes.\nThere is also a gender component to our feelings about money and identity. For men, historically the breadwinner in the family, the lack of money can mean a lack of self-esteem and deepening depression. Without money and the power it bestows, many men have experienced a fall from the macho, once safe bastion of male entitlement.\nIn the recent economic down turn, many men have lost jobs and have not recovered. Unfortunately, men generally have few resources emotionally to deal with the blow of a lost job, lost status and power. Tragically the suicide rate for males 45-65 years old has jumped 50% in the last 5 years.\nFor women who have recently become important wage earners in the house, resentment and fatigue may rule their emotions around money. Women who work full time, have kids and have a husband at home still do a large portion of household and child management. They may feel under appreciated and taken advantage of within the family system.\nConversely, one of you may have made or inherited a great deal of money. Having a disproportionate amount of money in the hands of one partner can lead to power struggles and deeper attachment issues in the couple. The partner with money may dismiss the other partner’s inputs into the relationship, devaluing and dismissing the non wage earner. This is toxic to the relationship, creating resentment and deep-seated anger. If this is happening in your relationship, take a step back and gain some empathy for the other. Money should not be the North Star in your adult relationship; money is an adjunct to a healthy connection not a lever of power.\nWHAT IS YOUR AND YOUR PARTNER’S ATTACHMENT STYLE AROUND MONEY?\nAn exploration of emotional meaning around money for each partner is highly important for the couple to function and to understand one another. Developing and empathic understanding for the other’s experience, from childhood to adulthood, fears and attachment style around money is critical for a functioning, connected couple.\nIn an effort to develop safe communication around the topic of money, here is a questionnaire for each partner to fill out and share. This is not a psychological assessment tool, and is only designed to jump start the conversation:\n1. When you were growing up, was money scarce in your house?\n2. If so, what are the feelings that money brings up for you now?\na. Anxiety, worries, fear, shame?\nb. Anger, resentment maybe shame\nc. Numbing, don’t want to think about money\nd. Secure, not worried and aware that money was to be appreciated and work was respected.\n3. If money was abundant in your house growing up, what are the feelings that money brings up for you?\na. Worry, anxiety about loosing it, careful of maintaining it\nb. Money makes you angry, maybe your father or mother was so preoccupied with making money, they didn’t pay attention to you.\nc. You don’t think about it have strong feelings; it is there and taken care of. Not a concern\nd. You knew there was money yet there was a healthy consideration for maintaining it and being respectful about your family’s money.\n4. What do you do now with your feelings about the lack of or wealth in your family of origin?\na. Work very hard to make or keep your money, hopefully calming your anxiety. You want to control where the money is, where it is spent and what is happening with the money.\nb. Your anger pushes you to either pursue money or not at all. Your decisions regarding money are reactive causing you to make impulsive decisions about money.\nc. You are not worried about making money or keeping it. You don’t want the stress. Your partner can deal with it.\nd. You feel balanced about your family of origin and money, not reactive, aware and respectful of money.\n5. How do you treat/feel about your partner around money?\na. Controlling! You are anxious and can’t bear how much he/she spends.\nb. Angry, you spend money to get back at your partner’s controlling tendencies.\nc. Don’t care, ask or get involved, your partner takes care of things.\nd. You are involved and respectful of your partner’s help. You invest, manage and talk about your money without issues together. You work well as a team.\nIf you answered “a” most of the time, you have an anxious attachment style around money. You may feel deep shame and fear in relation to money. Your challenge is to allow for close, connected and loving relationships while soothing your anxieties around money.\nYou may tend to control money; you may get upset about your partner’s spending habits leading to tension in the relationship. You might even feel that money and the security it bestows you is more important than your adult relationships. This is detrimental to your well being, we know that loneliness over time kills.\nIf you answered “b” most often, your style is reactive and angry. Money causes you to make impulsive decisions. Perhaps you spend too much or make unwise investments. Something about money causes you to be emotional and unable to step back from finding a safe balanced relationship to money.\nIf “c” was your most common answer, you are avoidant about money. You don’t want to deal with the emotional implications of money. Money may have been abundant in your house growing up and you did not have to develop respect for money. You emotionally shut down in respect to money and assume all is well.\nIt is possible that you may be intimidated by managing your money, allowing your partner to do the heavy lifting. You don’t want to ask too many questions. You detach from the process of handling or maintaining your money, leaving the day-to-day bill paying to your partner.\nIf you answered with “d” most often, you are secure emotionally around money. You understand money is important and it comes with hard work and responsibility. You don’t need to control those around you with money. You are balanced and responsible with creating, investing money while having a healthy adult relationship.\nCREATING A NARRATIVE BOTH INDIVIDUALLY AND AS A COUPLE\nFor each partner, think about and write up a story that is illustrative of what was happening with money in your family of origin. Stay in the feelings around this story. Were you scared? Were you ashamed of not having what other kids had at school? Were you proud of the things your family had? What is the physical experience of the meaning of money from your childhood? Did the thought of money create a pit in your stomach? A tight jaw? Try to stay in the felt sense of what money does to your physical being. This can provide you with a great deal of information.\nThink about each of your parents, what kind of homes did they grow up in? What were their attachment style regarding money? What did they model for you around money?\nHow do you bring those influences to your relationship today? What does your spouse bring? Can you find empathy for the meaning of money for yourself and your spouse?\nNext, start to co-create a narrative around money with your spouse. What do you both stand for? What are your goals? What do you want to invest in? How do you want to retire? Are you going to pay for your kid’s college? What do you want your legacy to be? Create a narrative that encompasses both of your values and meanings around money.\nThen develop a plan on how to spend, manage and invest your money together. This is best done with an investment advisor. Both partners need to know where the money is, including passwords to accounts. Both need to monitor the growth, spending and income of assets. When you become true partners, equal in decision making with empathy and compassion for the other on emotional level in regards to money, you will feel content and safer within the couple.", "scores": {"score": 2, "score_transform_1": 4, "score_transform_2": 4, "score_transform_3": 0}}

{"id": "9964", "text": "This is a sponsored conversation written by me on behalf of L’Oréal® Paris Elvive. The opinions and text are all mine.\nI’ve mentioned how much I love my new hair color, but it’s taken a bit of an adjustment to get used to how much drier (and damaged) the color can make my hair over time. Lately I’ve found myself looking for products that really add protein and strength back in my hair and moisturize and repair dry damaged hair. I recently took the L’Oréal Paris Elvive hair quiz to see how damaged my hair really was. I am between a level 2 and 3 which means that coloring my hair and using heat tools regularly are causing dryness, split ends and breakage over time. The good news though is that L’Oréal Paris has so many great products to help combat damaged hair and get your locks feeling and looking soft, shiny and full of life again.\nL’OREAL PARIS PRODUCTS TO HELP DAMAGED HAIR\nThe L’Oréal Paris Elvive hair quiz recommended some great products for me that I had never tried before. I ended up purchasing the L’Oréal Paris Elvive Extraordinary Oil Treatment and the L’Oréal Paris Elvive Total Repair 5 Protein Recharge at Walgreens. I immediately tried the Protein Recharge that night. It is a leave-in hair treatment for damaged hair that instantly recharges your hair and fights the 5 signs of damage, leaving your hair with 97 percent less breakage with results in just one use. Our hair is made of protein, but daily brushing and heat tools can cause dryness and damage. The Protein Recharge nourishes hair to help increase strength, flexibility and protect against every day damage. It made my hair feel so soft and even stronger after just one use. I applied it to all of my hair, but especially at the ends and the roots around my face where they are more damaged from heat tools. It can even protect your hair from up to 450 degrees of heat.\nAfterwards, I combed through my hair and then applied the Elvive Extraordinary Oil Treatment. This oil serum is another leave in hair treatment that hydrates and nourishes to transform lifeless hair to soft and lustrous hair. It is infused with sunflower oils, is non-greasy, super lightweight, and not only makes hair soft and shiny, it smells amazing too! I applied the hair oil all over my hair as a finishing polish, especially applying liberally to the ends of my hair. This oil will make your hair 10 times more nourished in just 1 drop and leave you with instant shine and hair that is silky to the touch.\nI had been hearing such great things about sunflower oil when used on your damaged hair, so I was especially excited to try this product. Sunflower oil really helps to penetrate your hair and scalp leaving your hair and scalp moisturized, shinier, fuller and healthier. I used to shy away from using oils or leave in products in my hair thinking they would make it so oily, but now I can see that my hair needs these oils and proteins replenished, and it will actually make my hair look and feel better. If you’re worried about it making your hair feel oily, try it on your ends first, but if you color your hair or use heat tools on it, odds are that you can use the moisture back in your hair like I could.\nAfter only one use I could already see and feel a big difference. Depending on your level of damaged hair, L’Oréal Paris also makes a Total Repair 5 Damage Erasing Balm and Color Vibrancy Repair and Protect Balm that you can try. Do you have damaged hair? Make sure you take the L’Oréal Paris Elvive hair test and let me know which level hair you have and find out which products are best for your hair type.

{"text": "EFT is a form of psychological acupressure, based on the same energy meridians used in traditional acupuncture to treat physical and emotional ailments\nfor over 5,000 years, but without the invasiveness of needles.

{"text": "In Computational intelligence and neuroscience\nDiabetes is a chronic disease that can cause several forms of chronic damage to the human body, including heart problems, kidney failure, depression, eye damage, and nerve damage. There are several risk factors involved in causing this disease, with some of the most common being obesity, age, insulin resistance, and hypertension. Therefore, early detection of these risk factors is vital in helping patients reverse diabetes from the early stage to live healthy lives. Machine learning (ML) is a useful tool that can easily detect diabetes from several risk factors and, based on the findings, provide a decision-based model that can help in diagnosing the disease. This study aims to detect the risk factors of diabetes using ML methods and to provide a decision support system for medical practitioners that can help them in diagnosing diabetes. Moreover, besides various other preprocessing steps, this study has used the synthetic minority over-sampling technique integrated with the edited nearest neighbor (SMOTE-ENN) method for balancing the BRFSS dataset. The SMOTE-ENN is a more powerful method than the individual SMOTE method. Several ML methods were applied to the processed BRFSS dataset and built prediction models for detecting the risk factors that can help in diagnosing diabetes patients in the early stage. The prediction models were evaluated using various measures that show the high performance of the models. The experimental results show the reliability of the proposed models, demonstrating that k-nearest neighbor (KNN) outperformed other methods with an accuracy of 98.38%, sensitivity, specificity, and ROC/AUC score of 98%. Moreover, compared with the existing state-of-the-art methods, the results confirm the efficacy of the proposed models in terms of accuracy and other evaluation measures. The use of SMOTE-ENN is more beneficial for balancing the dataset to build more accurate prediction models. This was the main reason it was possible to achieve models more accurate than the existing ones.\nUllah Zahid, Saleem Farrukh, Jamjoom Mona, Fakieh Bahjat, Kateb Faris, Ali Abdullah Marish, Shah Babar", "metadata": {"date": 1708997298000, "dump": "CC-MAIN-2024-10", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947474669.36/warc/CC-MAIN-20240226225941-20240227015941-00698.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9423106909, "token_count": 435, "url": "http://doctorpenguin.com/2022-10-11_13_summary/"}, "scores": [3], "document_id": "1"}

{"text": "Are you getting tired of looking for the signs yet? Are you growing weary of searching through YouTube channels, Facebook, Twitter, and all the other venues of the internet to see the next sure sign that the Lord is coming back soon, looking for the next event that will “cap off” all the others. “And then if any man shall say to you, Lo, here is Christ; or, lo, he is there; believe him not.” (Mark 13:21)\nThis is part of the reason for some of the signs we are seeing, so that those who do not desire to be about the business that they are supposed to be doing will be drawn away by not only false signs, but false Christs. So far the main body of material seems to be floods, fires, and sinkholes, but the advent of beings from outer space is also beginning to creep into the images and news stories that are captivating the minds of those who seem to say no more than “He is coming back soon!” Yes, He is, but what are you doing to show a lost world what they need to do before He does.\nThese items are going to be drawing more and more people away as they increase in frequency, for they will look to and for the signs as proof of the coming event, and in far too many cases these same individuals will be doing little more than that, just looking. Once the fires die down and the waters flow less through the streets of the cities, these same individuals will begin to look elsewhere, as stated, the coming alien invasion seems to be permeating quite a bit of these “news” broadcasts, volcanoes and earthquakes of course will fit into the ”prophetic” warnings, but if you will recall, our Lord said that he would return for us, “For in such an hour as ye think not the Son of man cometh.” (Matt. 24:44)\nWhat will be next then, someone doing “miracles” that some believe could only be attributed to God? Many will fall prey to that great deceit, the Roman Catholic Church has been a great “purveyor,” if you will, of so-called visible miracles for quite some time, it is a good way to keep the masses in check, to keep the “obedience through the possibility of persecution” continuing, so it would not surprise me if we begin to see a few false signs coming from that direction. Some will say the so-called pandemic is a sure sign, but these have done very little research into the factual evidence, others will point to the coming global economic crisis, the great worldwide famines that are inevitable, the cashless society, or perhaps the advent of artificial intelligence that soon Christ will take His church out, (1 Thess. 4:17)\nHere is the point my friends, what difference should it make to any of us, to any born-again believer when the Lord comes back, how exactly is that going to change in one bit what you should be doing and what you were supposed to be accomplishing for Him since the first day that you were saved from your sins? Haven’t you been warning the lost all this time anyway, haven’t you been telling them of His love, grace, and mercy since the day you got off your knees at the cross? Did you really need all these signs to “kick start” your faith, your obedience to what you are supposed to be doing even without them?\nHere is the next trap of our adversary that so many have already fallen into, spending far too much time looking at the signs, searching for the next one, and not bringing into the conversation the need for repentance to a lost world, and not just so these people that will listen will miss the tribulation period, but so they will avert an eternity of pain and great suffering, so that they also can come to the knowledge of the grace of God that is available through Jesus Christ.\nWill some perhaps listen a little more intently when you expound to them the truths of the Scriptures in relation to these days, perhaps, but how many will make a true confession of faith and how many will only be trapped by the same emotional construct that is affecting so many others these days, only to fall away when a specific period of peaceful times ensue. Are we in the last days? We have been since our Lord went back to the Father. Are we in the last of the last days, or how about nearing the end of the last of the very last days, how many adjectives would you like to add here. Recall what the two angels said to those who were standing around looking up at the sky for who knows how long after that moment. “Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven? this same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven.” (Acts 1:11)\nAre you doing the same, is all you do any more in relation to the words in this letter to you is to search high and low for the next sign of His imminent return, wondering to yourself “This is it!” To put it bluntly my brothers and sisters, get back to work, keep your eyes on the prize that is Christ, reprove, rebuke, lift up your brothers and sisters in Christ, love you neighbor, take a glance occasionally at what is happening around the planet, but don’t sit there staring at the sky all day, you have a job you are supposed to be doing. “Wherefore comfort one another with these words.” (1 Thess. 4:18) And then get back to work.", "metadata": {"date": 1708886115000, "dump": "CC-MAIN-2024-10", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947474641.34/warc/CC-MAIN-20240225171204-20240225201204-00798.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.972667098, "token_count": 1196, "url": "https://www.borrowedtruths.com/get-back-to-work/"}, "scores": [0], "document_id": "5"}
{"text": "If you tune in and listen to the ‘Drive Show’ that airs on Radio Maisha every Monday to Friday from 4-7pm, then you are familiar with the voice of one Zulekha.\nZulekha is the show’s comedian. If you’ve ever wondered if a pretty girl can be funny, then you’ve not met Zulekha. I must say she is talented. Together with her co-host Tina Koroso, they have managed to keep thousands of listeners glued to their show every drive time.\nWhen she is behind the mic, from time to time, she changes her tone of voice. From a deep Somali accented old woman to a young Meru lad, Zulekha has captured the attention of her listeners who are always left in stitches due to her jokes. But what is she like up close and candid?\nZulekha Akinyi Otieno is a striking woman, the kind that owns a room the minute she walks in. But there is also another side to her. She is down-to-earth. What many people may not know is that she is half Somali half Luo.\nBorn and brought up in Zimmerman in Nairobi, Zulekha had to endure a difficult childhood and the painful memories are still evident. “I come from a single parent family. My mother shouldered the responsibility of raising us. I have two brothers and I am the middle child,” says Zulekha.\n“The painful part is that my father was a drunkard. He cared less if we had eaten, had clothes to wear and even books to use while in school. His life was centered on the ‘bottle’ and many are the times he left us to go on his numerous drinking sprees,” she says.\nNot having the zeal and strength to take it anymore, Zulekha says her mother decided that they shift and move to another place to start life on their own away from their father.\n“We had to flee. He didn’t even know that we had shifted to another place. At that time, I was in class two at Roysambu Primary School. My mum was open with us and gave us two options. If anyone wished to stay behind with dad then they could and if we wanted to go with her, she was not going to stop us. My brothers and I decided to go stay with mum, through thick and thin,” she bitterly recalls.\nHer dad would later die of throat cancer in 2004. “Despite his bad lifestyle, he still made time to visit us when we shifted. I have never felt bitter towards my dad. Growing up, I told myself that there is no one who does not make mistakes in life.\nHe was still our dad and we still loved him,” she says. They started their new life in Zimmerman but problems seemed to trail their way. Her mum couldn’t raise the Sh2,500 needed for rent. To make ends meet, she started a small business of making and selling chips and bhajia.\nWhen she came back from school, Zulekha would assist in selling the foodstuffs. As fate would have it, in 2009, Zulekha fell pregnant. “I realised I was pregnant at three months. I was devastated. I didn’t know how I was going to break the news to my mum.\nThoughts of having an abortion rang in my head but on a second thought, I decided I was going to keep my baby,” she says. Since it was hard for her to disclose the news to her mum, she decided to keep it to herself\n.“My mum began to notice changes in me when I was about eight months pregnant. She requested one of my aunts to come and talk to me. I had to tell her the truth. I could not hide it anymore. My mum was so devastated by the news.\nThis opened new challenges to our already stressing lives. She didn’t even want to eat food I had cooked and most of the time she was crying that I also felt bad,” she says. In November 2009, Zulekha gave birth to her son, Abdul Malik Otieno. This opened a new chapter in her life. She had to look for a job. She ventured into the entertainment industry in the same year and joined a popular programme that airs on one of the local channels.\nShe also tried her luck as a stand-up comedian in one of the local comic shows. “In 2012, I joined Kenya Kona comedy which used to air on KTN,” she says. Her breakthrough came in August 2013 when she landed a job at Radio Maisha. She recounts that moment when that call came through.\n“I was called by Radio Maisha head of radio Tom Japanni. He told me of how he had listened to me perform on the comedy shows and how I made people laugh at my jokes. He noticed my potential and requested me to visit the office which I did. Though I had never thought of joining radio, I decided to go for it,” she says.\nZulekha officially went on air in September 2013 and as she puts it, it has been an amazing experience. “My main role in the show is to bring out the light side and not make things too serious. At drive time, everyone has had a long day from work and they just want to listen to something relaxing as they go home. They want to sit and listen to Zulekha who has to make them laugh,” she says.\nIn the show, Zulekha acts as a fourty-something year old woman who doesn’t take life too serious and has her own way of dealing with issues. “It’s a character I love. As much as that woman is crazy, she fears God. I not only disturb my co-host but also the listeners,” she adds.\nAs a comedenne, and a female comic for that matter, Zulekha says she has had her fair share of challenges in the industry, from being undermined on first instances to cases of her original jokes being performed by another well-established comedian.\n“All I can say is it has taken God’s grace for me to break the ceiling in the world of comedy. Sometimes I walk out of studio after the show and can’t believe I am the one who did that. My mum cries tears of joy when she listens to me. She is proud of my achievements,” says Zulekha.\nAs the sole breadwinner in her family, she says: “I have to work hard to remain vibrant, fresh and remain abreast with the daily happenings to ensure my jokes are educative and entertaining and make people laugh,” she says.\n“It’s not easy to be spontaneous every day. In the comedy industry, it is wrong to repeat what another comedian has said. It is a crime. But I strive to do my best. I use the opportunity I have been given not only to make people laugh, but also make them learn and change their lives.”\nZulekha, however, regrets that many youth are wasting away in their homes yet they have talents that can earn them money. “Whatever you can do, do it today and give it your best because you are not guaranteed of tomorrow.\nKeep fighting because nothing comes easy. I used to write a lot of jokes and keep them in the house not knowing what God planned for me. It is all about persistence,” says Zulekha.", "metadata": {"date": 1708824882000, "dump": "CC-MAIN-2024-10", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947474573.20/warc/CC-MAIN-20240225003942-20240225033942-00299.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9898227453, "token_count": 1610, "url": "https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/evewoman/living/article/2000148202/comedian-zulekha-otienomaking-people-laugh-is-no-joke"}, "scores": [1], "document_id": "6"}

The cognitive revolution (although considered by some as an overly stated fact) is suggested to have been a response to the behaviorist movement that rejected introspection (anti-mentalism), and controversially lead to, what some consider, a dissolvement of the behaviorist movement. Consider the following questions about cognitivism and discuss each, basing your posture on this week’s readings, your past experiences, and your past knowledge.\n- Why is it suggested that cognitivists disagree with the behaviorist view that learning only occurs if there is an outward manifestation? What other notable differences do these two theories suggest?\n- Do you agree with the cognitivist view that learning is a change in one’s schemata? (Support with citations.)\n- How have your personal schemata changed throughout your life? (Could be about learning, but also about other domains such as love, honesty, hard work, loyalty, etc.)\n- List an example of a schema that has changed, in your own knowledge development. involving the field of psychology.\n- Based on cognitivism, what implications does it suggest is a potential concern for effectively processing information when cognitive load is not effectually considered?\n- Do you recall a time where learning was difficult because there were too many components all at once?

They are low in calories and rich in vitamins and minerals, making them a healthy choice for those looking to watch their carbohydrate intake.\nIn a serving of cherry tomatoes, which is typically about 1 cup or 149 grams, there are about 27 grams of carbohydrates. This accounts for roughly 9% of the daily recommended intake of carbohydrates for the average adult.\nHowever, it's important to note that not all carbohydrates are created equal. Cherry tomatoes are a good source of dietary fiber, which is a type of carbohydrate that is not fully digested by the body. Fiber acts as a bulking agent in the digestive system, helping to promote regularity and prevent constipation. It also helps to slow down the absorption of sugar into the bloodstream, which can help to regulate blood sugar levels.\nIn addition to fiber, cherry tomatoes contain a variety of other nutrients that make them a healthy choice. They are rich in vitamins A and C, as well as potassium, which is important for the functioning of the heart, muscles, and nerves. They also contain lycopene, which is a powerful antioxidant that has been linked to a reduced risk of certain types of cancer.\nWhen incorporating cherry tomatoes into your diet, it's important to consider how they fit into your overall carbohydrate intake for the day. If you are following a low-carb or ketogenic diet, you may want to limit your serving size of cherry tomatoes or choose other low-carb vegetables instead.\nHere are a few tips for incorporating cherry tomatoes into your meals:\n- Add them to salads: Cherry tomatoes make a colorful and flavorful addition to any salad. Toss them with some leafy greens, a protein source like grilled chicken or tofu, and a low-carb dressing for a healthy and satisfying meal.\n- Roast them: Roasted cherry tomatoes have a sweet and concentrated flavor that is perfect for adding to pasta dishes or spreading on toast. Simply toss them in olive oil, season with salt and pepper, and roast in the oven until they are soft and caramelized.\n- Snack on them: Cherry tomatoes make a great snack on their own or paired with some protein-rich cheese or hummus. They are portable and easy to eat, making them a convenient option for on-the-go snacking.\nOverall, cherry tomatoes are a delicious and nutritious addition to any diet. They are low in calories and carbohydrates but pack a punch when it comes to vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants. Whether you enjoy them fresh, roasted, or in salads, cherry tomatoes are a versatile and healthy choice for any meal or snack.\nYou may want to see also\nAre cherry tomatoes considered a low-carb food?\nCherry tomatoes are small, round tomatoes that are both delicious and nutritious. They are commonly used in salads, salsas, and as a garnish for various dishes. One common question that arises when it comes to cherry tomatoes is whether they are considered a low-carb food. In this article, we will delve into this topic and provide you with the information you need.\nTo determine if cherry tomatoes are low-carb, we must first understand the concept of low-carb diets. Low-carb diets are based on the principle of reducing carbohydrate intake and replacing it with fats and proteins. The goal of these diets is to promote weight loss, improve blood sugar control, and enhance overall health.\nCarbohydrates are the main source of energy for the body, and they are found in various foods such as grains, fruits, vegetables, and dairy products. However, not all carbohydrates are created equal. Some carbohydrates, such as those found in fruits and vegetables, are considered complex carbohydrates and are generally healthier than simple carbohydrates found in processed foods and sugary snacks.\nCherry tomatoes fall into the category of vegetables and are therefore considered a complex carbohydrate. They are relatively low in calories and carbohydrates compared to other types of tomatoes. According to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), one cup of cherry tomatoes contains approximately 27 calories and 6 grams of carbohydrates.\nThe low carbohydrate content of cherry tomatoes makes them suitable for individuals following low-carb diets. They can be included in salads, omelets, or enjoyed as a snack without significantly impacting blood sugar levels or derailing a low-carb eating plan.\nIn addition to being low in carbs, cherry tomatoes are also packed with various vitamins and minerals. They are an excellent source of vitamin C, potassium, and folate. These nutrients contribute to the overall health and well-being of individuals, making cherry tomatoes a great addition to a healthy diet.\nTo incorporate cherry tomatoes into your low-carb diet, you can enjoy them in various ways. They can be sliced and added to salads, roasted with olive oil and herbs, or used as a topping for grilled meats or fish. Their sweet and tangy flavor can add a burst of freshness to any dish.\nIn conclusion, cherry tomatoes can be considered a low-carb food due to their relatively low calorie and carbohydrate content. They are a nutritious addition to any diet, providing essential vitamins and minerals. Whether you are following a low-carb eating plan or simply looking to incorporate more vegetables into your meals, cherry tomatoes are a versatile and delicious choice.\nYou may want to see also\nCan you incorporate cherry tomatoes into a low-carb diet?\nCherry tomatoes are a popular ingredient in many dishes, and if you are following a low-carb diet, you may be wondering if they can be incorporated into your meal plan. Fortunately, cherry tomatoes are a great addition to a low-carb diet and can provide numerous health benefits.\nCherry tomatoes are low in carbohydrates and calories, making them an excellent choice for those looking to reduce their carbohydrate intake. In fact, one cup of cherry tomatoes contains only around 6 grams of carbohydrates, making them a suitable choice for those following a low-carb diet.\nIn addition to being low in carbohydrates, cherry tomatoes are also packed with essential nutrients. They are an excellent source of vitamin C, potassium, and fiber. Vitamin C is important for supporting a healthy immune system, while potassium is important for maintaining proper heart and muscle function. The fiber content in cherry tomatoes can aid in digestion and help keep you feeling full and satisfied.\nIncluding cherry tomatoes in your low-carb diet is easy and versatile. They can be used in a variety of dishes, including salads, sauces, and even as a snack on their own. For example, you can toss cherry tomatoes into a salad with mixed greens, cucumber, and avocado for a low-carb and nutrient-dense meal. You can also roast cherry tomatoes and use them as a topping for grilled chicken or fish.\nIt is worth noting that while cherry tomatoes are low in carbohydrates, their carbohydrate content can vary slightly depending on their size and ripeness. To ensure a more accurate carbohydrate count, it is recommended to weigh or measure the cherry tomatoes before incorporating them into your meal plan.\nIn conclusion, cherry tomatoes are a great addition to a low-carb diet. They are low in carbohydrates, while also providing essential nutrients such as vitamin C, potassium, and fiber. Including cherry tomatoes in your meals and snacks can add flavor and variety to your low-carb diet, while also providing numerous health benefits. So go ahead and enjoy those cherry tomatoes guilt-free!\nYou may want to see also\nAre there any carbs in cherry tomatoes that should be avoided on a low-carb diet?\nCherry tomatoes are a popular choice for low-carb dieters due to their small size, vibrant flavor, and versatility. These bite-sized tomatoes can be enjoyed in salads, sauces, or simply as a healthy snack. But are there any carbs in cherry tomatoes that should be avoided on a low-carb diet? Let's take a closer look.\nCarbohydrates are one of the three macronutrients found in food, along with protein and fat. They are an essential source of energy for the body, but not all carbohydrates are created equal. Some carbohydrates, like those found in processed foods and sugary treats, can lead to weight gain and affect blood sugar levels.\nHowever, not all carbohydrates are bad for you. In fact, fruits and vegetables, including cherry tomatoes, are nutrient-dense foods that provide essential vitamins, minerals, and fiber. The carbohydrates found in these foods are typically considered complex carbohydrates, which take longer to digest and have a lower impact on blood sugar levels.\nSo, how many carbs are in cherry tomatoes? On average, one cup of cherry tomatoes contains about 6 grams of carbohydrates. This may vary slightly depending on the size and ripeness of the tomatoes. However, keep in mind that these carbs come from natural sugars and fiber, which are beneficial for overall health.\nOn a low-carb diet, it is generally recommended to limit daily carbohydrate intake to around 20-50 grams, depending on individual needs and goals. Including a serving of cherry tomatoes in your meal plan can easily fit within this range. In fact, cherry tomatoes can be a great source of essential nutrients while still keeping your carbohydrate intake low.\nAdditionally, cherry tomatoes are rich in antioxidants, such as lycopene, which has been linked to various health benefits. Lycopene is a powerful antioxidant that helps protect against harmful free radicals and may reduce the risk of certain chronic diseases, including heart disease and certain types of cancer.\nWhen incorporating cherry tomatoes into your low-carb diet, it's important to consider the other components of your meal. For example, if you're enjoying a salad with cherry tomatoes, make sure to choose low-carb toppings and dressings to keep your overall carbohydrate intake in check. Pairing cherry tomatoes with protein and healthy fats, such as avocado or olive oil, can also help balance out your meal and provide a satisfying, nutrient-rich option.\nIn conclusion, cherry tomatoes are a delicious and nutritious addition to a low-carb diet. While they do contain carbohydrates, these are natural sugars and fiber that can be beneficial for overall health. By controlling portion sizes and balancing your meal with other low-carb options, you can enjoy the vibrant flavor of cherry tomatoes without sabotaging your low-carb goals.\nYou may want to see also\nWhat other low-carb options can be paired with cherry tomatoes in a meal?\nCherry tomatoes are a versatile ingredient that can be paired with a variety of low-carb options to create a delicious and satisfying meal. Whether you are following a low-carb diet or simply looking to incorporate more veggies into your meals, cherry tomatoes are a great choice.\nOne popular option is to pair cherry tomatoes with fresh mozzarella and basil to create a Caprese salad. This classic combination is not only low in carbs, but also packed with flavor. To make the salad, simply slice the cherry tomatoes in half and combine them with slices of fresh mozzarella and whole basil leaves. Drizzle with olive oil and balsamic vinegar for added flavor.\nAnother option is to use cherry tomatoes as a topping for grilled chicken or fish. Simply toss the cherry tomatoes in olive oil, salt, and pepper, then grill them until they are slightly charred. This adds a burst of fresh flavor to your protein without adding any extra carbs.\nIf you're looking for a heartier option, consider pairing cherry tomatoes with zucchini noodles. Zucchini noodles, or zoodles, are a low-carb alternative to traditional pasta noodles. Simply spiralize the zucchini, sauté it in olive oil until tender, then toss it with roasted cherry tomatoes and your favorite low-carb sauce. This is a great option for those following a ketogenic diet or looking to reduce their carb intake.\nFor a quick and easy lunch option, try pairing cherry tomatoes with avocado and chicken or tuna. Simply dice the cherry tomatoes and avocado, then mix them together with cooked chicken or tuna. Season with salt, pepper, and your favorite herbs or spices for added flavor. This makes for a delicious and satisfying salad that is low in carbs and high in protein.\nLastly, if you're in the mood for something warm and comforting, consider roasting cherry tomatoes with a medley of low-carb vegetables. Simply toss the cherry tomatoes with vegetables like bell peppers, zucchini, and eggplant, then drizzle with olive oil and season with salt, pepper, and your favorite herbs or spices. Roast in the oven until the vegetables are tender and caramelized. This makes for a flavorful side dish or can be served over cauliflower rice or spaghetti squash for a complete meal.\nIn conclusion, there are many low-carb options that can be paired with cherry tomatoes to create a delicious and satisfying meal. Whether you're in the mood for a fresh salad, a protein-packed dish, or a warm and comforting meal, cherry tomatoes can be incorporated in a variety of ways.

The participants had their vitamin D levels checked within 100 days of their surgery or 100 days after the operation.\nNormal vitamin D levels were found in 21 patients, but 81 transplant recipients were deficient. The rejection rate in the deficient group was more than twice as high as the group with adequate levels of vitamin D.

As the zygotes transition through the cell cycle, these [Ca 2+]i oscillations progressively diminish until they cease in interphase zygotes. While the mechanism(s) underlying the regulation of [Ca2+]i oscillations may be multi-layered, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (IP3Rs) emerge as a focal point in this regulation. IP3Rs, the calcium channels expressed in all cell types and abundantly expressed in mammalian eggs, contain consensus sequences for phosphorylation by various kinases and interact with members of the cytoskeleton, serving as an integrator of regulatory signals. This dissertation highlights the impact of biochemical and cellular changes in IP3R-1 on fertilization-induced [Ca2+]i oscillations.

{"text": "Please welcome Rhoda as she kindly stops here on her Historical Fiction Virtual Book Tour to discuss her new book. She has brought us a terrific guest post!!!\nThe difficulties suffered by women of past generations who worked in factories to provide for their families is almost unimaginable to us today. Factory work took a toll on women physically, emotionally, and financially. In addition, factory work damaged the relationships with their partners and children.\nPhysically, most factory workers of the past had to endure tiresomely long days. Standing on their feet, in the extreme cold and heat without modern temperature controls must have been unbearable. For most of American history, the factory workers received only Sundays off. At the time, Sunday was considered a day of rest due to stricter applications of biblical preachings. Overnight shifts and holidays were required, and factories often produced a lot of smog and pollution. Not only were the workers covered with soot, but they were inhaling it. They would blow their noses and the soot would be be expelled from the nose onto the handkerchief. Many factories required huge fires or boilers of some sort to produce the energy to power the equipment that was being used. Thus, adding to the extreme temperatures.\nAs second class citizens of decades past, women were often thought of as expendable. They were intimidated by threats that a man could replace them. Many women lost their jobs during pregnancy because the employer did not want to be concerned with physical limitations of the pregnant women. Nor did the employers want to lose an employee during the delivery and recovery period. Unlike seamstress or house servant jobs, factories put women side by side with male co-workers. Many women were sexually harassed or assaulted because the employers and male co-workers realized there was no place for the female worker to go. A woman who had a family could not just quit, file a lawsuit, or collect unemployment. She had to endure the disrespect and violation that her employers or co-workers wished to inflict upon her. It was a trap--a trap that was created by the society of men in power. The laws of the time stated that a woman could not be raped, claiming it was physically impossible. In her 2007 book, Rape: A History from 1860 to the present, author Joanna Bourke quoted directly from medical textbooks of the past that rape was impossible. The medical and legal profession claimed \"it is impossible to sheath a sword into a vibrating scabbard.\" Immigrant women suffered even worse. Signs were often displayed “No Irish Need Apply”, causing more stress for women. This was the reality women faced, not just in the factories, but in all aspects of their lives.\nSome factories who employed women paid them much less than male counterparts. In addition, if the woman was an immigrant she was often paid even less. The only way for such women to be able to work and ensure care for their children would be to live with family. Often there would be groups of people living in one household that functioned as one unit. The large amount of people were often cramped into close quarters because wages were too low to pay for larger homes. It is nearly unfathomable for Americans today to repair shoes, or stuff items in their shoes to prolong wear. Darning socks is a thing of the past. These were amongst the things that were required of low paying factory workers in order to financially survive.\nIn 1975, author Henry \"Hank\" Leiferman wrote of the struggles of one mill worker in his book Crystal Lee: A Woman of Inheritance. Crystal Lee Pulley fought for better working conditions and unionization of her mill. She was fired from the mill, yet gained a position with the union to improve conditions elsewhere. However, since 1976 the American textile industry has lost 2.6 million jobs. Although conditions improved, the jobs eventually disappeared. This left women unemployed and competing with others who were better educated.\nFactory and/or warehouse life today still causes great hardships for women and their families. Many women are forced to work overnight shifts, weekends, and holidays. Having to work a shift such as 2:30pm to 11:00 pm causes a disconnect in the family because the mother only sees her children an hour or so before sending them off to school in the morning. By the time they return from school, she is already at work. The burdens of childcare costs are staggering. Often the woman is a single mother who lives paycheck to paycheck. Even unionized warehouse or factory establishments which have better conditions overall cause much stress amongst the families.\nAlthough working conditions and the social status of women have improved over the last century, women are still facing obstacles in the workplace. Perhaps looking to their sisters of the past, women of the present can gain the strength to face their own struggles today.\nCreateSpace Independent Publishing\nFormats: eBook, Paperback, Audio Book\nGenre: Historical Fiction\nREAD AN EXCERPT.\nBuy the Book\nAmazon (Audio Book)\nNational Military Family Association\n$1 per sale will be donated, regardless of what format is purchased---ebook, print, audiobook & regardless of site purchased---will be donated to the National Military Family Association.

She began working at the United States Postal Service at 25 years old, and over the past 15 years has accumulated many humorous stories about situations that the public never gets to know about. Her first ebook, \"Goin' Postal: True Stories of a U.S. Postal Worker\" was so popular that readers requested it in paperback. Recently, she published the humorous \"Goin' Postal\" in paperback along with another story entitled, \"The Creek: Where Stories of the Past Come Alive\". Combining these two into one book may seem strange, as one is humorous and the other is a heart wrenching historical fiction, however, doing so proves to the reader Rhoda D'Ettore's versatility.Rhoda D'Ettore received her degree in Human & Social Services while working at USPS, has travelled extensively, and loves history. Over the years she has volunteered for several community service organizations, including fostering abused and neglected dogs for a Dalmatian rescue.\nFor more information please visit Rhoda's website.

{"text": "Sacramento Public Library hit the road earlier this summer with electric bookmobiles. The library on wheels visits local events and communities with limited access to libraries. Last year, bookmobiles logged over 10,000 miles visiting communities throughout Sacramento County.\nThe two new bookmobiles replaced the 25-year old diesel vehicles thanks to a partnership with the Sacramento Metropolitan Air Quality Management District and California State Library.\n“We were long overdue for a change. The average bookmobile’s lifespan is 10-15 years,” said Cathy Crosthwaite, Sacramento Public Library Deputy Director. “This is one small way we can make an impact in our daily operations. Plus, the new EVs are so much quieter and provide a better experience for our patrons.”\nThe library’s Mobile Services team visits senior sites, residential communities, mobile home parks, and assisted living facilities. Our bookmobiles have served the community since 1948 and operate as mini libraries. Staff customize the collection based on the community’s preferences with materials in various languages, genres and formats. Library users can place items on hold over the phone or online to be checked out from the vehicle.\n“It’s vital that we meet the community where they are and get outside of the library walls. Bookmobiles help us make those connections,” said Todd Deck, Sacramento Public Library Community Engagement Manager. “Our team does their best to reach folks that can’t otherwise get to a library. Bookmobiles also provide social interactions and help foster community between residents and the staff who deliver library services to them.”\nWhen the pandemic hit in March 2020, the library temporarily closed for a few months. The Mobile Services team was the first to resume library services and get back into the community. For many patrons, especially seniors, the bookmobile is one of the few social outlets they have in a month.\nIn 2022, Sacramento Public Library bookmobiles made nearly 800 visits circulating 35,800 materials including books, DVDs, hotspots and more. The library has two regular bookmobile routes. The family route, which focuses on children and families in apartment complexes and other affordable housing communities, visits 10 locations. The senior route visits more than 40 retirement communities, assisted living centers, and mobile home parks on a monthly schedule.\nThis program is funded in part by:", "metadata": {"date": 1709312014000, "dump": "CC-MAIN-2024-10", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947475422.71/warc/CC-MAIN-20240301161412-20240301191412-00398.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9388421774, "token_count": 488, "url": "https://www.saclibrary.org/About/News/2023/evbookmobile"}, "scores": [2], "document_id": "16"}
{"text": "You know those block graphic symbols that allows you to draw lines, corners, intersections, fine bar charts, etc. they are useful and one can do a lot of stuff, but their code arrangements always struck me as arbitrary / random. But then maybe I just haven't figured out the logic. Does anybody know why they ended up with the codes they got?\nThe \"PETSCII\" encoding is based on keyboard positions of the original PET chicklet keyboard (*1):\n(Taken from Wikipedia)\nThe keyboard is made similar to basic typewriter keyboards, but ordered in a square fashion, including a top row of symbols but not numbers and a separate numeric keyboard. By every key holding only a single ASCII equivalent symbol (*2), it leads to a direct encoding of ASCII as key position.\nAs a side effect the whole shift level could be used for graphics, as they did. All symols are ordered in a (mostly) useful pattern, like having\nUIJK forming the 4 sections of a circle,\nOPL: doing the same for the corners of a large square and\n0.-=the same for a small square.\nIt not only looks neat on the keyboard but also makes a good UI as far as ordering of symbols can get.\nThe downside is that graphic symbols are encoded according to the (unsifted) character code. And here combinations like\nUIJK are simply non-continuous. As listing the PETSCII assignment shows:\n(Taken from Wikipedia)\nFrom a programmers perspective this is less than perfect. A logical sequence for related items (*3) could have been more helpful. This is especially true for the 16 codes that form a 2x2 division of a character cell would allow an easy 'bitmap' mode for 80x48 pixel (*4). Much like contemporary TRS-80 and Sinclair's ZX80/81 some years later.\nAn additionally sad part is that PETSCII itself isn't direct used for display, but translated into screencodes beforehand. If not right ahead, this would have been a good point to reorder.\n... and so it became history :)\n*1 - The Wikipedia entry for 'Chicklet Keyboard' is a nice example for a retrograde explanation.\n*2 - Almost as if the first version was not meant to use shift.\n*3 - Much like ASCII offers a monotone sequence for numbers ($30..$39) and letters ($41..$5A). The later according to the usual lexical sequence, as made popular by Bartholomeus Anglicus.\n*4 - As usual they have been used anyway, but with a translation layer. Some of them, written in BASIC, look more like on purpose obfuscation.\nI think the codes were laid out so that when laid out sensibly on the PET keyboard, the shifted and unshifted forms of each key would have a consistent relationship. When the VIC-20 reduced the number of keys but added the Commodore key, this made it necessary to rearrange the placement of graphics on the keys; since Commodore kept the same arrangement of character codes, however, this meant that the arrangement no longer seemed to make as much sense.\nOne can see a similar effect in the design of ASCII. Many typewriters used to use a shifted 2 for a quotation mark, early teletypes did likewise, and thus the ASCII code for the quote mark is one bit different from that of the digit 2, even though modern keyboards use a shifted apostrophe as the quote mark.", "metadata": {"date": 1709108341000, "dump": "CC-MAIN-2024-10", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947474700.89/warc/CC-MAIN-20240228080245-20240228110245-00699.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9505418539, "token_count": 726, "url": "https://retrocomputing.stackexchange.com/questions/15706/c64-petscii-block-graphic-symbol-was-there-ever-a-logical-reason-for-their-asc/15709"}, "scores": [4], "document_id": "17"}

This metabolically active body organ is accountable for a number of yet essential life features. Liver's main function is--.\nBile manufacturing & discharging.\nSecretes cholesterol, hormonal agents, bilirubin, and medications.\nMetabolizes fats, carbohydrates, and healthy proteins.\nSynthesizes plasma proteins like clotting as well as albumin.\nShops vitamins, minerals, and also glycogen.\nBlood filtration & detoxing.\nAs the liver obtains revealed to great deals of crucial tasks it undergoes injuries. Nevertheless, it has Hepatocyte cells that can replicate after damages or surgical elimination of the liver part. Despite the fact that the capacity of the liver to react to injury and restore itself is amazing, repeated insults can cause liver condition that can be deadly.\nLiver condition can not be identified in its very early phase, so when diagnosed there are serious difficulties that accompany it. Clinical therapies are hardly as reliable as the condition is gradually damaging in nature. Researchers really feel that the method CBD oil works with the endocannabinoid system, it can help manage liver disease symptoms, therefore providing far better life quality as well as relief in the people.\nDisease monitoring will rely on the origin cause of decreased liver feature. Some of the signs and symptoms like stomach pain, swelling in ankle joints, chronic exhaustion, scratchy skin, appetite loss, nausea or vomiting, as well as getting bruised easily can be treated with CBD vape juice or full-spectrum CBD oil.\nExactly how CBD oil will assist in liver condition administration?\nCBD oil is not a treatment for liver condition therapy however helps in managing linked adverse effects and symptoms.\nCBD and pain relief.\nVicodin and Tylenol for discomfort alleviation can trigger negative effects like more damage to the liver, so patients need to find a different discomfort reducer. CBD indirectly functions with CB1 & CB2 receptors located across the body.\nIt even functions indirectly with non-cannabinoid receptors like glycine. It is an inhibitory i was reading this receptor that contributes in the assumption of discomfort. CBD raises the influence of glycine receptors thus reducing the feeling of pain.\nCBD and inflammation.\nThe CB2 receptors are plainly located in your central nerve system.

{"text": "A lamb is a young sheep that is still weak and defenseless when unprotected and alone. Because of this, lambs are targeted by predators because they present easy prey to them. When lambs are left on their own, they either get hunted down or stuck and lost, so they need guidance.\nThese are the qualities that make lambs so symbolic. They are a sign of innocence, purity, vulnerability, and sacrifice. Many of these symbols overlap with the symbolism of youth.\nLambs have been sacrificial animals throughout the entire human history – even the Ancient Greeks and Romans used lambs as sacrificial animals. Later, lambs became symbolic of Jesus Christ’s sacrifice for his followers.\nIn this article, we’ll discuss the symbolism of lambs in Christianity, literature, and life. You’ll find some interesting meanings that you perhaps didn’t know about before.\nThe 8 Symbolisms of Lamb in Life\nAs such, lambs are innocent animals that are still naive and new to life. They don’t have the experience or the ability to protect themselves, so they stick to groups instead of wandering away on their own. They’re also oblivious to the dangers around them.\nBecause of that, lambs represent innocence – sometimes, even human innocence. They are not aware of what is out there and what the world looks like – they need to be guided and protected by the group.\nLambs are small and weak, and they do not become sheep until the age of 1. They can’t protect themselves alone, so they need to stay in groups or be protected by their parents. If they stray away from the group, the likelihood of their survival is close to zero.\nIt is this vulnerability of lambs that made them so symbolic, even in Christianity. They’ve become the symbol of God because they represent the weakest, vulnerable part of God, the part which is always willing to give to humans.\nNot only lambs, but sheep can be a representative of an individual’s vulnerability. As spirit animals, sheep (and lamb) denote that someone is vulnerable in their character. It’s symbolic of someone who needs support from others in times of need when things get tough, just like lambs do when they are in danger.\nRead Article: Black Sheep Spiritual Meaning and Symbolism\nAs lambs are fresh and new to the world, they are free from sin. This is one of the most revered qualities of Christianity and a huge reason why lambs are so symbolic in Christianity, too.\nThe wolf is impure, while the lamb is pure and weak. The wolf is the hunter, greedy, and looking for food, which can represent the dark side of our character. On the other hand, we have lambs that are pure and vulnerable, and sometimes even weak. In a way, it’s a collision of two different parts of our character.\nLambs have always been sacrificial animals. From the Ancient Greeks and Romans to Christians and even later civilizations, lambs were used for sacrifice to a higher purpose. In most cases, it was the sacrifice to Gods.\nAccording to Merriam-Webster, the term sacrificial lamb represents something or someone that’s sacrificed for the greater good.\nEven today, lambs are used for sacrifice in Passover sacrifice, which was an important part of the Israelite faith. Today, it’s only practiced by Samaritans at Mount Gerizim. In most cases, the sacrifice of lambs represents something that’s beneficial for the greater good of the community.\nIn the Abrahamic religion, a lamb was and is a very highly valued possession. This term of the sacrifice of the lambs is widely present in everyday life, too. A good example of this is in politics, where a sacrificial lamb is a candidate in elections who has little or no chance of winning an election but is still representing the party for the greater good.\nWe’ll touch on the meaning of the sacrifice of lambs in Christianity later on, because there are many references to it in the Bible, too.\nLambs are also highly symbolic of family. They are often depicted in Ancient paintings and works of art together with a sheep and a ram, which is obviously a symbol for the family. The lamb is the child, the sheep is the mother, and the ram is the father.\nWhen we think about it, lambs can also represent children in a way. They are both young, naive, and new to the world, and also not aware of the real world around them. They are oblivious to the bad things happening in the world, and also somewhat unable to survive with the help of their parents. They represent the same qualities, such as innocence and purity.\n7. Herd Behavior\nHerd behavior is obviously typical for animals – they form herds without a centralized leader for the purpose of staying safe and without directions. Lambs can represent that to an extent. It also represents a degree of naivety and a lack of introspection where individuals follow vague beliefs and directions from someone else. Without a “shepherd”, they are lost.\nSometimes, this term is coined in financial settings where investors follow other investors blindly based on prior results or false beliefs.\nThis symbolism is similar to the symbolism of childhood. Lambs don’t know how to decide for themselves, so they follow others. And when they do that, they might not follow the best examples – they only follow the ones they find the strongest and most convincing.\nThis naivety can lead them astray in their later years. Just like teenagers get lost, lambs and sheep can get lost themselves and might find themselves in danger. They can either get stuck somewhere or be hunted by predators.\nThe Symbolism of Lambs in Christianity\nLambs are one of the central symbols of Christianity. They represent sacrifice and purity, two of the most important pillars of the Christian faith. As such, they are highly symbolic of God himself, who is pure and sacrifices himself for his followers.\nLamb also signifies innocence in Christianity. It’s symbolic of everything that’s innocent, including Jesus Christ himself. This is visible in several passages of the Bible, including this passage from Isaiah:\n“The wolf shall dwell within the lamb, and the leopard shall lie down with the kid; and the calf and the young lion and the fatling together, and a little child shall lead them.”\nIn this passage, the lamb is described as this conforming and innocent animal that’s seeking guidance. In this passage, the wolf denotes anyone that’s against innocent and the lamb represents innocence, which is the opposite of the wolf.\nIn Christianity, lambs are also sacrificial animals, which is often denoted in the Bible itself, too. They also represent Jesus Christ’s sacrifice for his followers and the sacrifices we make for the greater good.\nThis is visible in the Book of Genesis where Abraham sacrifices the lamb which is provided by God, which is the perfect sacrificial offering.\nHowever, perhaps the most notable symbolism of the lamb in Christianity is that of the true Lamb of God. The lamb of God is also synonymous with Jesus himself, who is seen as the sacrifice for the rest of his followers and for the rest of humanity. This is portrayed by John the Baptist in his passage (1:29):\n“Behold, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin from the world!”\nJesus becomes the Lamb of God, and he is defenseless and is led to death freely. He frees his followers from sin and death. This symbolism has become legendary in Christianity and perhaps the most notable mention of the lamb in the Bible. As such, the main meaning of the lamb in the Bible is that of sacrifice.\nThe Symbolism of Lambs in Literature\nBecause lambs are so symbolic, they are often present in literature, too.\nOne of the most notable examples is the poem by William Blake called The Lamb. In this poem, the lamb is the subject and the main “protagonist”. It represents the perfect creation by God, and it gives wool to humans, which is a gift from God himself. Also, Blake describes the voice of the lamb as “tender”.\nThe entire setting of the poem seems somewhat idyllic and pastoral. Perhaps the lamb is symbolic also of beauty and perfection, and also of the nature that is so beautiful (which is described in the poem).\nBy the end of the poem, the term lamb is synonymous with God who created the lamb. God is represented by a small child and the lamb is his creation.\nLambs are historically and symbolically very notable animals. They’ve been used as sacrificial animals centuries ago, even by Ancient Greeks and Romans. They represent innocence, purity, and sacrifice. They are also symbolic of naivety, childhood, family, and also belonging.\nBecause of their traits and features, lambs are highly symbolic also in Christianity and literature, as well as in other faiths (Israelites and Abrahamism). It’s interesting to explore the symbolism of lamb and the different meanings of lamb – some are even unexpected!\nI’m Chris and I run this website – a resource about symbolism, metaphors, idioms, and a whole lot more!

{"text": "Shunt Clipping Circuits:\nA positive Shunt Clipping Circuits is illustrated in Fig. 3-28(a). Here the diode is connected in shunt (or parallel) with the output terminals. When the input is negative, the diode is reverse biased and only a small voltage drop occurs across RI, due to load current IL. This means that the circuit output voltage (Vo) is approximately equal to the negative input peak (-E). When the input is +E, D1 is forward biased, and the output voltage equals the diode voltage drop (+VF). Thus, the positive half of the waveform is clipped off. As illustrated, the upper and lower levels of the output of a positive shunt clipper are approximately +VF and -E.\nA negative Shunt Clipping Circuits is exactly the same as a positive shunt clipper with the diode polarity reversed, [see Fig. 3-28(b)]. The negative half-cycle of the waveform is clipped off.\nAs in the case of series clipping circuits, Shunt Clipping Circuits may be used with square, sinusoidal, or other input waveforms.\nShunt Noise Clipper:\nThe shunt noise clipper shown in Fig. 3-30 removes noise riding on the peaks of an input waveform. The signal amplitude must be greater than the diode forward voltage drop. The output waveform is clipped, at ±VF , so that the noise is not passed to the output. This type of clipper is used with pulse signals, where the pulse amplitude is not important. In this case, information is contained in the pulse width, or simply in its presence or absence.\nBiased Shunt Clipper:\nFigure 3-31 shows a clipping circuit that uses two diodes which have different bias voltages. The cathode of D1 is connected to a +2 V bias (VB1), and the anode of D2 has a -2 V bias (VB2). While the input waveform amplitude is less than ±(VB + VF), neither diode is forward biased, and the input is simply passed to the output. When the positive input is greater than (VB1 + VF). D1 becomes forward biased, and the output cannot exceed this voltage. Similarly, when the negative input goes below (-VB2 – VF). D2 is forward biased, and the output is limited to -(VB2 + VF).\nFor obvious reasons, the circuit is termed a biased Shunt Clipping Circuits. Biased shunt clippers are used to protect circuits or devices from (positive/negative) input voltages that must not exceed specified levels.\nThe voltage across resistor R1 is (E – Vo), and the resistor current is the sum of the load current and the diode forward current (IL + IF). As in other diode circuits, a minimum level of IF is selected, and the resistor value is calculated as,\nZener Diode Shunt Clipper:\nA Zener diode shunt clipper produces the same kind of result as a biased shunt clipper without the need for bias voltages. The clipper circuit in Fig. 3-32 has two back-to-back series-connected Zener diodes.\nWhen the input voltage is positive and has sufficient amplitude, D1 is forward bias and D2 is biased into reverse breakdown. At this time, the output voltage is limited to (VF + VZ2). A negative input voltage produces a maximum negative output of -(VF + VZ1). With equal-voltage Zener diodes, the maximum output voltage is,\nThe resistor voltage is (E – Vo), and the resistor current is (IL + IZ).

Here are some information about slots.\nThere are two fundamental sets of spins no matter the casino where you play at home: one for the console, one for the computer and the other for consoles. The ball spins for one time when you place your wager. Then it stops. The staff at the casino will inform you when the ball needs to stop and begin with the next spin. The direction that the ball spins depends on the symbols that are visible on the reels. The symbol the ball is spinning on determines the direction it will take. If the symbol for up is used to indicate that the ball is moving upwards, that is the direction in which the ball will travel.\nAt online casinos you will see a random number generator (RNG). It is a set of computer software that generates numbers that determine the symbols that will be displayed on the reels. When a player plays at casinos online, they utilize one of these random numbers generators. This software ensures pay by mobile casino free spins that the bets placed upon random chance.\nRandom number generators determine the outcome of every spin on the casino slot machine. At online casinos , the outcome of each spin is decided by a program which is downloaded on your PC. A random number generator is installed on your PC, and you can begin spinning a slot machine whenever you wish. Many people believe that because they know the outcome of the random number generator, they are somehow cheating. You could increase your chances of win by cheating the machine.\nYou have a higher chance of winning than the house edge of the casino. The house advantage refers to the percentage of slot machine profits that casino owners make. Casinos have a higher percentage of slots playing, which means they are more likely to be successful. Casino owners earn more from their progressive slots due to the fact that they own more of them.\nCasinos online are designed to allow players to play for as long as they like. You can quit playing in the event that you become bored. Many players prefer to benefit from bonuses that do not require deposit that some casinos online offer. Online slot players who wager big winnings have a better chance of double their initial bet.\nPlaying for free or progressive slots can allow you to make real money. There are no limitations on how much money you can earn. You will need an Internet connection to play for free online slot machines at casinos.\nEach machine spins an entirely different set of coins. Random elements will determine the combinations that the machines generate. While the casino will attempt to create as random a spin as is possible by using only the most likely options, no machine is perfect. Multi-bets are the most effective method to increase your chances of winning the jackpot. You can increase your winnings by knowing what the odds of a slot machine are for every spin on a particular machine.", "metadata": {"date": 1709196344000, "dump": "CC-MAIN-2024-10", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947474795.48/warc/CC-MAIN-20240229071243-20240229101243-00398.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9442362785, "token_count": 666, "url": "https://shamanlodgeresortecuador.com/find-out-which-slots-are-paying-more/"}, "scores": [2], "document_id": "21"}
{"text": "\"Kapila said, 'The Vedas are regarded as authoritative by all. People never\ndisregard them. Brahma is of two kinds, viz., Brahma as represented by sound, and Brahma as Supreme (and intangible). 1 One conversant with Brahma represented by sound succeeds in attaining to Supreme Brahma. Commencing with the rites of Garbhadhana, that body which the sire creates with the aid of Vedic mantras is cleansed (after birth) by Vedic mantras. 2 When the body has been cleansed with purificatory rites (performed with the aid of Vedic mantras), the owner there of come to be called a Brahmana and becomes a vessel fit for receiving knowledge of Brahma. Know that the reward of acts is purity of heart which only leads to Emancipation. I shall presently speak to thee of that. Whether purity of heart has been attained or not (by performance of acts) is what can be known to the person himself who has attained it. It can never be known with the aid of either the Vedas or inference. They that cherish no expectation, that discard every kind of wealth by not storing anything for future use, that are not covetous, and that are free from every kind of affection and aversion, perform sacrifices because of the conviction that their performance is a duty. To make gifts unto deserving persons is the end (right use) of all wealth. Never addicted at any time to sinful acts, observant of those rites that have been laid down in the Vedas, capable of crowning all their wishes with fruition, endued with certain conclusions through pure knowledge, never giving way to wrath,--never indulging in envy, free from pride and malice, firm in Yoga, 3 of unstained birth, unstained conduct, and unstained learning, devoted to the good of all creatures, there were in days of yore many men, leading lives of domesticity and thoroughly devoted to their own duties, there were many kings also of the same qualifications, devoted to Yoga (like Janaka, etc.), and many Brahmanas also of the same character (like Yajnavalkya and others). 4 They behaved equally towards all creatures and were endued with perfect sincerity. Contentment was theirs, and certainty of knowledge. Visible were the rewards of their righteousness, and pure were they in behaviour and heart. They were possessed of faith in Brahma of both forms. 5 At first making their hearts pure, they duly observed all (excellent) vows. They were observant of the duties of righteousness on even occasions of distress and difficulty, without failing off in any particular. Uniting together they used to perform meritorious acts. In this they found great happiness. And inasmuch as they never tripped, they had never to perform any expiation. Relying as they did\nupon the true course of righteousness, they became endued with irresistible energy. They never followed their own understandings in the matter of earning merit but followed the dictates of the scriptures alone for that end. Accordingly they were never guilty of guile in the matter of performing acts of righteousness. 1 In consequence of their observing unitedly the absolute ordinances of the scriptures without betaking themselves ever to the rites laid down in the alternative, they were never under the necessity of performing expiation. 2 There is no expiation for men living in the observance of the ordinances laid down in the scriptures. The Sruti declares that expiation exists for only men that are weak and unable to follow the absolute and substantive provisions of the sacred law. Many Brahmanas there were of this kind in days of old, devoted to the performance of sacrifices, of profound knowledge of the Vedas, possessed of purity and good conduct, and endued with fame. They always worshipped Brahma in the sacrifices, and were free from desire. Possessed of learning they transcended all the bonds of life. The sacrifices of these men, their (knowledge of the) Vedas, their acts performed in obedience to the ordinances, their study of the scripture at the fixed hours, and the wishes they entertained, freed as they were from lust and wrath, observant as they were of pious conduct and acts notwithstanding all difficulties, renowned as they were for performing the duties of their own order and mode of life, purified as their souls were in consequence of their very nature, characterised as they were by thorough sincerity, devoted as they were to tranquillity, and mindful as they were of their own practices, were identical with Infinite Brahma. Even this is the eternal Sruti heard by us. 3 The penances of men that were so high-souled, of men whose conduct and acts were so difficult of observance and accomplishment, of men whose wishes were crowned with fruition in consequence of the strict discharge of their duties, became efficacious weapons for the destruction of all earthly desires. The Brahmanas say that that Good Conduct, which is wonderful, whose origin may be traced to very ancient times, which is eternal and whose characteristics are unchangeable, which differs from the practices to which even the good resort in seasons of distress and represents their acts in other situations, which is identical with heedfulness, over which lust and wrath and other evil passions can never prevail, and in consequence of which there was (at one time) no transgression in all mankind, subsequently came to be distributed into four subdivisions, corresponding with the four modes of life by persons unable to\npractise its duties in minute detail and entirety. 1 They that are good, by duly observing that course of Good Conduct after adoption of the Sannyasa mode of life, attain to the highest end. They also that betake themselves to the forest mode reach the same high end (by duly observing that conduct). They too that observe the domestic mode of life attain to the highest end (by duly practising the same conduct); and, lastly, those that lead the Brahmacharya mode obtain the same (end by a due observance of the same conduct). 2 Those Brahmanas are seen to shine in the firmament as luminaries shedding beneficent rays of light all around. Those myriads of Brahmanas have become stars and constellations set in their fixed tracks. In consequence of contentment (or Renunciation) they have all attained to Infinity as the Vedas declare. If such men have to come back to the world through the wombs of living creatures, they are never stained by sins which have the unexhausted residue of previous acts for their originating cause. Indeed, one who has led the life of a Brahmacharin and waited dutifully upon his preceptor, who has arrived at settled conclusions (in respect of the soul), and who has devoted himself to Yoga thus, is truly a Brahmana. Who else would deserve to be called a Brahmana? When acts alone determine who is a Brahmana and who is not, acts (good or bad) must be held to indicate the happiness or misery of a person. As regards those that have by conquering all evil passions acquired purity of heart, we have heard the eternal Sruti that in consequence of the Infinity to which they attain (through beholding the universal soul) and of the knowledge of Brahma (they acquire through the declarations of Srutis), they behold everything to be Brahma. The duties (of tranquillity, self-restraint, abstention from acts, renunciation, devotion, and the abstraction of Samadhi) followed by those men of pure hearts, that are freed from desire, and that have Emancipation only for their object, for acquisition of the knowledge of Brahma, are equally laid down for all the four orders of men and all the four modes of life. Verily, that knowledge is always acquired by Brahmanas of pure hearts and restrained soul. 3 One whose soul is for Renunciation\nbased upon contentment is regarded as the refuge of true knowledge. Renunciation, in which is that knowledge which leads to Emancipation, and which is highly necessary for a Brahmana, is eternal (and comes down from preceptor to pupil for ever and ever). 1 Renunciation sometimes exists mixed with the duties of other modes. But whether existing in that state or by itself, one practises it according to the measure of one's strength (that depends upon the degree of one's absence of worldly desires). Renunciation is the cause of supreme benefit unto every kind of person. Only he that is weak, fails to practise it. That pure-hearted man who seeks to attain to Brahma becomes rescued from the world (with its misery).' 2\n\"Syumarasmi said, 'Amongst those that are given up to enjoyment (of property), they that make gifts, they that perform sacrifices, they that devote themselves to the study of the Vedas, and they that betake themselves to a life of Renunciation after having acquired and enjoyed wealth and all its pleasures, when they depart from this world, who is it that attains to the foremost place in heaven? I ask thee this, O Brahmana! Do thou tell me truly.'\n\"Kapila said, 'Those who lead a life of domesticity are certainly auspicious and acquire excellence of every kind. They are unable, however, to enjoy the felicity that attaches to Renunciation. Even thou mayst see this.' 3\n\"Syumarasmi said, 'Ye depend upon knowledge as the means (for the attainment of Emancipation). Those who lead lives of domesticity have planted their faith in acts. It has, however, been said that the end of all modes of life is Emancipation. 4 No difference, therefore, is observable between them in respect of either their superiority or inferiority of puissance. O illustrious one, do thou tell me then how stands the matter truly.'\n\"Kapila said, 'Acts only cleanse the body. Knowledge, however, is the highest end (for which one strives). 5 When all faults of the heart are cured (by acts), and when the felicity of Brahma becomes established in knowledge,\nbenevolence, forgiveness, tranquillity, compassion, truthfulness, and candour, abstention from injury, absence of pride, modesty, renunciation, and abstention from work are attained. These constitute the path that lead to Brahma. By those one attains to what is the Highest. That the cure of all faults of the heart is the result of acts becomes intelligible to the wise man when these are attained. That, indeed, is regarded as the highest end which is obtained by Brahmanas endued with wisdom, withdrawn from all acts, possessed of purity and the certitude of knowledge. One who succeeds in acquiring a knowledge of the Vedas, of that which is taught by the Vedas (viz., Brahma as represented in acts), and the minutiae of acts, is said to be conversant with the Vedas. Any other man is only a bag of wind. 1 One who is conversant with the Vedas knows everything, for everything is established on the Vedas. Verity, the present, past, and future all exist in the Vedas. 2 This one conclusion is deducible from all the scriptures, viz., that this universe exists and does not exist. To the man of knowledge this (all that is perceived) is both sat and asat. To him, this all is both the end and the middle. 3 This truth rests upon all the Vedas, viz., that when complete Renunciation takes place one obtains what is sufficient. Then again the highest contentment follows and rests upon Emancipation, 4 which is absolute, which exists as the soul of all mortal and immortal things, which is well-known as such universal soul, which is the highest object of knowledge as being identical with all mobile and immobile things, which is full, which is perfect felicity, which is without duality, which is the foremost of all things, which is Brahma, which is Unmanifest and the cause also, whence the Unmanifest has sprung, and which is without deterioration of any kind. 5 Ability to subdue the senses, forgiveness, and abstention from work in consequence of the absence of desire,--these three are the cause of perfect felicity. With the aid of these three qualities, men having understanding for their eyes succeed in reaching that Brahma which is\nuncreate, which is the prime cause of the universe, which is unchangeable and which is beyond destruction. I bow to that Brahma, which is identical with him that knows it.'\" 1", "metadata": {"date": 1709008676000, "dump": "CC-MAIN-2024-10", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947474670.19/warc/CC-MAIN-20240227021813-20240227051813-00797.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9777814746, "token_count": 2612, "url": "http://bharatadesam.com/spiritual/mahabharata/mahabharata_12b097.php"}, "scores": [2], "document_id": "22"}

The cultivated and wild species both have small tubers, which can grow close to each other. From these tubers grow small round leaves close to the ground.

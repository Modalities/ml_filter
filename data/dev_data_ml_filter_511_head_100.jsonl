{"text":"In Computational intelligence and neuroscience\nDiabetes is a chronic disease that can cause several forms of chronic damage to the human body, including heart problems, kidney failure, depression, eye damage, and nerve damage. There are several risk factors involved in causing this disease, with some of the most common being obesity, age, insulin resistance, and hypertension. Therefore, early detection of these risk factors is vital in helping patients reverse diabetes from the early stage to live healthy lives. Machine learning (ML) is a useful tool that can easily detect diabetes from several risk factors and, based on the findings, provide a decision-based model that can help in diagnosing the disease. This study aims to detect the risk factors of diabetes using ML methods and to provide a decision support system for medical practitioners that can help them in diagnosing diabetes. Moreover, besides various other preprocessing steps, this study has used the synthetic minority over-sampling technique integrated with the edited nearest neighbor (SMOTE-ENN) method for balancing the BRFSS dataset. The SMOTE-ENN is a more powerful method than the individual SMOTE method. Several ML methods were applied to the processed BRFSS dataset and built prediction models for detecting the risk factors that can help in diagnosing diabetes patients in the early stage. The prediction models were evaluated using various measures that show the high performance of the models. The experimental results show the reliability of the proposed models, demonstrating that k-nearest neighbor (KNN) outperformed other methods with an accuracy of 98.38%, sensitivity, specificity, and ROC\/AUC score of 98%. Moreover, compared with the existing state-of-the-art methods, the results confirm the efficacy of the proposed models in terms of accuracy and other evaluation measures. The use of SMOTE-ENN is more beneficial for balancing the dataset to build more accurate prediction models. This was the main reason it was possible to achieve models more accurate than the existing ones.\nUllah Zahid, Saleem Farrukh, Jamjoom Mona, Fakieh Bahjat, Kateb Faris, Ali Abdullah Marish, Shah Babar","metadata":{"date":1708997298000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947474669.36\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240226225941-20240227015941-00698.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9423106909,"token_count":435,"url":"http:\/\/doctorpenguin.com\/2022-10-11_13_summary\/"},"score":3,"id":"1"}

{"text":"Are you getting tired of looking for the signs yet? Are you growing weary of searching through YouTube channels, Facebook, Twitter, and all the other venues of the internet to see the next sure sign that the Lord is coming back soon, looking for the next event that will “cap off” all the others. “And then if any man shall say to you, Lo, here is Christ; or, lo, he is there; believe him not.” (Mark 13:21)\nThis is part of the reason for some of the signs we are seeing, so that those who do not desire to be about the business that they are supposed to be doing will be drawn away by not only false signs, but false Christs. So far the main body of material seems to be floods, fires, and sinkholes, but the advent of beings from outer space is also beginning to creep into the images and news stories that are captivating the minds of those who seem to say no more than “He is coming back soon!” Yes, He is, but what are you doing to show a lost world what they need to do before He does.\nThese items are going to be drawing more and more people away as they increase in frequency, for they will look to and for the signs as proof of the coming event, and in far too many cases these same individuals will be doing little more than that, just looking. Once the fires die down and the waters flow less through the streets of the cities, these same individuals will begin to look elsewhere, as stated, the coming alien invasion seems to be permeating quite a bit of these “news” broadcasts, volcanoes and earthquakes of course will fit into the ”prophetic” warnings, but if you will recall, our Lord said that he would return for us, “For in such an hour as ye think not the Son of man cometh.” (Matt. 24:44)\nWhat will be next then, someone doing “miracles” that some believe could only be attributed to God? Many will fall prey to that great deceit, the Roman Catholic Church has been a great “purveyor,” if you will, of so-called visible miracles for quite some time, it is a good way to keep the masses in check, to keep the “obedience through the possibility of persecution” continuing, so it would not surprise me if we begin to see a few false signs coming from that direction. Some will say the so-called pandemic is a sure sign, but these have done very little research into the factual evidence, others will point to the coming global economic crisis, the great worldwide famines that are inevitable, the cashless society, or perhaps the advent of artificial intelligence that soon Christ will take His church out, (1 Thess. 4:17)\nHere is the point my friends, what difference should it make to any of us, to any born-again believer when the Lord comes back, how exactly is that going to change in one bit what you should be doing and what you were supposed to be accomplishing for Him since the first day that you were saved from your sins? Haven’t you been warning the lost all this time anyway, haven’t you been telling them of His love, grace, and mercy since the day you got off your knees at the cross? Did you really need all these signs to “kick start” your faith, your obedience to what you are supposed to be doing even without them?\nHere is the next trap of our adversary that so many have already fallen into, spending far too much time looking at the signs, searching for the next one, and not bringing into the conversation the need for repentance to a lost world, and not just so these people that will listen will miss the tribulation period, but so they will avert an eternity of pain and great suffering, so that they also can come to the knowledge of the grace of God that is available through Jesus Christ.\nWill some perhaps listen a little more intently when you expound to them the truths of the Scriptures in relation to these days, perhaps, but how many will make a true confession of faith and how many will only be trapped by the same emotional construct that is affecting so many others these days, only to fall away when a specific period of peaceful times ensue. Are we in the last days? We have been since our Lord went back to the Father. Are we in the last of the last days, or how about nearing the end of the last of the very last days, how many adjectives would you like to add here. Recall what the two angels said to those who were standing around looking up at the sky for who knows how long after that moment. “Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven? this same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven.” (Acts 1:11)\nAre you doing the same, is all you do any more in relation to the words in this letter to you is to search high and low for the next sign of His imminent return, wondering to yourself “This is it!” To put it bluntly my brothers and sisters, get back to work, keep your eyes on the prize that is Christ, reprove, rebuke, lift up your brothers and sisters in Christ, love you neighbor, take a glance occasionally at what is happening around the planet, but don’t sit there staring at the sky all day, you have a job you are supposed to be doing. “Wherefore comfort one another with these words.” (1 Thess. 4:18) And then get back to work.","metadata":{"date":1708886115000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947474641.34\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240225171204-20240225201204-00798.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.972667098,"token_count":1196,"url":"https:\/\/www.borrowedtruths.com\/get-back-to-work\/"},"score":0,"id":"5"}
{"text":"If you tune in and listen to the ‘Drive Show’ that airs on Radio Maisha every Monday to Friday from 4-7pm, then you are familiar with the voice of one Zulekha.\nZulekha is the show’s comedian. If you’ve ever wondered if a pretty girl can be funny, then you’ve not met Zulekha. I must say she is talented. Together with her co-host Tina Koroso, they have managed to keep thousands of listeners glued to their show every drive time.\nWhen she is behind the mic, from time to time, she changes her tone of voice. From a deep Somali accented old woman to a young Meru lad, Zulekha has captured the attention of her listeners who are always left in stitches due to her jokes. But what is she like up close and candid?\nZulekha Akinyi Otieno is a striking woman, the kind that owns a room the minute she walks in. But there is also another side to her. She is down-to-earth. What many people may not know is that she is half Somali half Luo.\nBorn and brought up in Zimmerman in Nairobi, Zulekha had to endure a difficult childhood and the painful memories are still evident. “I come from a single parent family. My mother shouldered the responsibility of raising us. I have two brothers and I am the middle child,” says Zulekha.\n“The painful part is that my father was a drunkard. He cared less if we had eaten, had clothes to wear and even books to use while in school. His life was centered on the ‘bottle’ and many are the times he left us to go on his numerous drinking sprees,” she says.\nNot having the zeal and strength to take it anymore, Zulekha says her mother decided that they shift and move to another place to start life on their own away from their father.\n“We had to flee. He didn’t even know that we had shifted to another place. At that time, I was in class two at Roysambu Primary School. My mum was open with us and gave us two options. If anyone wished to stay behind with dad then they could and if we wanted to go with her, she was not going to stop us. My brothers and I decided to go stay with mum, through thick and thin,” she bitterly recalls.\nHer dad would later die of throat cancer in 2004. “Despite his bad lifestyle, he still made time to visit us when we shifted. I have never felt bitter towards my dad. Growing up, I told myself that there is no one who does not make mistakes in life.\nHe was still our dad and we still loved him,” she says. They started their new life in Zimmerman but problems seemed to trail their way. Her mum couldn’t raise the Sh2,500 needed for rent. To make ends meet, she started a small business of making and selling chips and bhajia.\nWhen she came back from school, Zulekha would assist in selling the foodstuffs. As fate would have it, in 2009, Zulekha fell pregnant. “I realised I was pregnant at three months. I was devastated. I didn’t know how I was going to break the news to my mum.\nThoughts of having an abortion rang in my head but on a second thought, I decided I was going to keep my baby,” she says. Since it was hard for her to disclose the news to her mum, she decided to keep it to herself\n.“My mum began to notice changes in me when I was about eight months pregnant. She requested one of my aunts to come and talk to me. I had to tell her the truth. I could not hide it anymore. My mum was so devastated by the news.\nThis opened new challenges to our already stressing lives. She didn’t even want to eat food I had cooked and most of the time she was crying that I also felt bad,” she says. In November 2009, Zulekha gave birth to her son, Abdul Malik Otieno. This opened a new chapter in her life. She had to look for a job. She ventured into the entertainment industry in the same year and joined a popular programme that airs on one of the local channels.\nShe also tried her luck as a stand-up comedian in one of the local comic shows. “In 2012, I joined Kenya Kona comedy which used to air on KTN,” she says. Her breakthrough came in August 2013 when she landed a job at Radio Maisha. She recounts that moment when that call came through.\n“I was called by Radio Maisha head of radio Tom Japanni. He told me of how he had listened to me perform on the comedy shows and how I made people laugh at my jokes. He noticed my potential and requested me to visit the office which I did. Though I had never thought of joining radio, I decided to go for it,” she says.\nZulekha officially went on air in September 2013 and as she puts it, it has been an amazing experience. “My main role in the show is to bring out the light side and not make things too serious. At drive time, everyone has had a long day from work and they just want to listen to something relaxing as they go home. They want to sit and listen to Zulekha who has to make them laugh,” she says.\nIn the show, Zulekha acts as a fourty-something year old woman who doesn’t take life too serious and has her own way of dealing with issues. “It’s a character I love. As much as that woman is crazy, she fears God. I not only disturb my co-host but also the listeners,” she adds.\nAs a comedenne, and a female comic for that matter, Zulekha says she has had her fair share of challenges in the industry, from being undermined on first instances to cases of her original jokes being performed by another well-established comedian.\n“All I can say is it has taken God’s grace for me to break the ceiling in the world of comedy. Sometimes I walk out of studio after the show and can’t believe I am the one who did that. My mum cries tears of joy when she listens to me. She is proud of my achievements,” says Zulekha.\nAs the sole breadwinner in her family, she says: “I have to work hard to remain vibrant, fresh and remain abreast with the daily happenings to ensure my jokes are educative and entertaining and make people laugh,” she says.\n“It’s not easy to be spontaneous every day. In the comedy industry, it is wrong to repeat what another comedian has said. It is a crime. But I strive to do my best. I use the opportunity I have been given not only to make people laugh, but also make them learn and change their lives.”\nZulekha, however, regrets that many youth are wasting away in their homes yet they have talents that can earn them money. “Whatever you can do, do it today and give it your best because you are not guaranteed of tomorrow.\nKeep fighting because nothing comes easy. I used to write a lot of jokes and keep them in the house not knowing what God planned for me. It is all about persistence,” says Zulekha.","metadata":{"date":1708824882000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947474573.20\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240225003942-20240225033942-00299.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9898227453,"token_count":1610,"url":"https:\/\/www.standardmedia.co.ke\/evewoman\/living\/article\/2000148202\/comedian-zulekha-otienomaking-people-laugh-is-no-joke"},"score":1,"id":"6"}

The cognitive revolution (although considered by some as an overly stated fact) is suggested to have been a response to the behaviorist movement that rejected introspection (anti-mentalism), and controversially lead to, what some consider, a dissolvement of the behaviorist movement. Consider the following questions about cognitivism and discuss each, basing your posture on this week’s readings, your past experiences, and your past knowledge.\n- Why is it suggested that cognitivists disagree with the behaviorist view that learning only occurs if there is an outward manifestation? What other notable differences do these two theories suggest?\n- Do you agree with the cognitivist view that learning is a change in one’s schemata?

{"text":"Carbs are often thought of as the enemy when it comes to weight loss and maintaining a healthy diet. However, not all carbs are created equal, and there are certain types of carbohydrates that can actually be beneficial for your health. One such example is found in the delightful small package of goodness that is the cherry tomato. These tiny, flavor-packed tomatoes not only provide a burst of sweetness to your taste buds, but they also offer a rich source of carbohydrates that can be easily incorporated into a balanced diet. So, if you're a fan of these little red gems, keep reading to discover the benefits of carbs in cherry tomatoes and how they can be a valuable addition to your meals.\n|Vitamin C, Fiber, Potassium\n|18 per 100g\n|3.9g per 100g\n|0.9g per 100g\n|0.2g per 100g\n|2.6g per 100g\n|1.2g per 100g\n|24.9mg per 100g\n|237mg per 100g\n|10mg per 100g\n|0.4mg per 100g\nWhat You'll Learn\n- How many carbs are in a serving of cherry tomatoes?\n- Are cherry tomatoes considered a low-carb food?\n- Can you incorporate cherry tomatoes into a low-carb diet?\n- Are there any carbs in cherry tomatoes that should be avoided on a low-carb diet?\n- What other low-carb options can be paired with cherry tomatoes in a meal?\nHow many carbs are in a serving of cherry tomatoes?\nCherry tomatoes are a popular and delicious addition to salads, pasta dishes, and snacks. They are low in calories and rich in vitamins and minerals, making them a healthy choice for those looking to watch their carbohydrate intake.\nIn a serving of cherry tomatoes, which is typically about 1 cup or 149 grams, there are about 27 grams of carbohydrates. This accounts for roughly 9% of the daily recommended intake of carbohydrates for the average adult.\nHowever, it's important to note that not all carbohydrates are created equal. Cherry tomatoes are a good source of dietary fiber, which is a type of carbohydrate that is not fully digested by the body. Fiber acts as a bulking agent in the digestive system, helping to promote regularity and prevent constipation. It also helps to slow down the absorption of sugar into the bloodstream, which can help to regulate blood sugar levels.\nIn addition to fiber, cherry tomatoes contain a variety of other nutrients that make them a healthy choice.

They also contain lycopene, which is a powerful antioxidant that has been linked to a reduced risk of certain types of cancer.\nWhen incorporating cherry tomatoes into your diet, it's important to consider how they fit into your overall carbohydrate intake for the day. If you are following a low-carb or ketogenic diet, you may want to limit your serving size of cherry tomatoes or choose other low-carb vegetables instead.\nHere are a few tips for incorporating cherry tomatoes into your meals:\n- Add them to salads: Cherry tomatoes make a colorful and flavorful addition to any salad. Toss them with some leafy greens, a protein source like grilled chicken or tofu, and a low-carb dressing for a healthy and satisfying meal.\n- Roast them: Roasted cherry tomatoes have a sweet and concentrated flavor that is perfect for adding to pasta dishes or spreading on toast. Simply toss them in olive oil, season with salt and pepper, and roast in the oven until they are soft and caramelized.\n- Snack on them: Cherry tomatoes make a great snack on their own or paired with some protein-rich cheese or hummus. They are portable and easy to eat, making them a convenient option for on-the-go snacking.\nOverall, cherry tomatoes are a delicious and nutritious addition to any diet. They are low in calories and carbohydrates but pack a punch when it comes to vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants. Whether you enjoy them fresh, roasted, or in salads, cherry tomatoes are a versatile and healthy choice for any meal or snack.\nYou may want to see also\nAre cherry tomatoes considered a low-carb food?\nCherry tomatoes are small, round tomatoes that are both delicious and nutritious. They are commonly used in salads, salsas, and as a garnish for various dishes. One common question that arises when it comes to cherry tomatoes is whether they are considered a low-carb food. In this article, we will delve into this topic and provide you with the information you need.\nTo determine if cherry tomatoes are low-carb, we must first understand the concept of low-carb diets. Low-carb diets are based on the principle of reducing carbohydrate intake and replacing it with fats and proteins. The goal of these diets is to promote weight loss, improve blood sugar control, and enhance overall health.\nCarbohydrates are the main source of energy for the body, and they are found in various foods such as grains, fruits, vegetables, and dairy products. However, not all carbohydrates are created equal. Some carbohydrates, such as those found in fruits and vegetables, are considered complex carbohydrates and are generally healthier than simple carbohydrates found in processed foods and sugary snacks.\nCherry tomatoes fall into the category of vegetables and are therefore considered a complex carbohydrate. They are relatively low in calories and carbohydrates compared to other types of tomatoes. According to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), one cup of cherry tomatoes contains approximately 27 calories and 6 grams of carbohydrates.\nThe low carbohydrate content of cherry tomatoes makes them suitable for individuals following low-carb diets. They can be included in salads, omelets, or enjoyed as a snack without significantly impacting blood sugar levels or derailing a low-carb eating plan.\nIn addition to being low in carbs, cherry tomatoes are also packed with various vitamins and minerals. They are an excellent source of vitamin C, potassium, and folate. These nutrients contribute to the overall health and well-being of individuals, making cherry tomatoes a great addition to a healthy diet.\nTo incorporate cherry tomatoes into your low-carb diet, you can enjoy them in various ways. They can be sliced and added to salads, roasted with olive oil and herbs, or used as a topping for grilled meats or fish. Their sweet and tangy flavor can add a burst of freshness to any dish.\nIn conclusion, cherry tomatoes can be considered a low-carb food due to their relatively low calorie and carbohydrate content. They are a nutritious addition to any diet, providing essential vitamins and minerals. Whether you are following a low-carb eating plan or simply looking to incorporate more vegetables into your meals, cherry tomatoes are a versatile and delicious choice.\nYou may want to see also\nCan you incorporate cherry tomatoes into a low-carb diet?\nCherry tomatoes are a popular ingredient in many dishes, and if you are following a low-carb diet, you may be wondering if they can be incorporated into your meal plan. Fortunately, cherry tomatoes are a great addition to a low-carb diet and can provide numerous health benefits.\nCherry tomatoes are low in carbohydrates and calories, making them an excellent choice for those looking to reduce their carbohydrate intake. In fact, one cup of cherry tomatoes contains only around 6 grams of carbohydrates, making them a suitable choice for those following a low-carb diet.\nIn addition to being low in carbohydrates, cherry tomatoes are also packed with essential nutrients. They are an excellent source of vitamin C, potassium, and fiber. Vitamin C is important for supporting a healthy immune system, while potassium is important for maintaining proper heart and muscle function. The fiber content in cherry tomatoes can aid in digestion and help keep you feeling full and satisfied.\nIncluding cherry tomatoes in your low-carb diet is easy and versatile. They can be used in a variety of dishes, including salads, sauces, and even as a snack on their own. For example, you can toss cherry tomatoes into a salad with mixed greens, cucumber, and avocado for a low-carb and nutrient-dense meal. You can also roast cherry tomatoes and use them as a topping for grilled chicken or fish.\nIt is worth noting that while cherry tomatoes are low in carbohydrates, their carbohydrate content can vary slightly depending on their size and ripeness. To ensure a more accurate carbohydrate count, it is recommended to weigh or measure the cherry tomatoes before incorporating them into your meal plan.\nIn conclusion, cherry tomatoes are a great addition to a low-carb diet. They are low in carbohydrates, while also providing essential nutrients such as vitamin C, potassium, and fiber. Including cherry tomatoes in your meals and snacks can add flavor and variety to your low-carb diet, while also providing numerous health benefits. So go ahead and enjoy those cherry tomatoes guilt-free!\nYou may want to see also\nAre there any carbs in cherry tomatoes that should be avoided on a low-carb diet?\nCherry tomatoes are a popular choice for low-carb dieters due to their small size, vibrant flavor, and versatility. These bite-sized tomatoes can be enjoyed in salads, sauces, or simply as a healthy snack. But are there any carbs in cherry tomatoes that should be avoided on a low-carb diet? Let's take a closer look.\nCarbohydrates are one of the three macronutrients found in food, along with protein and fat. They are an essential source of energy for the body, but not all carbohydrates are created equal. Some carbohydrates, like those found in processed foods and sugary treats, can lead to weight gain and affect blood sugar levels.\nHowever, not all carbohydrates are bad for you. In fact, fruits and vegetables, including cherry tomatoes, are nutrient-dense foods that provide essential vitamins, minerals, and fiber. The carbohydrates found in these foods are typically considered complex carbohydrates, which take longer to digest and have a lower impact on blood sugar levels.\nSo, how many carbs are in cherry tomatoes? On average, one cup of cherry tomatoes contains about 6 grams of carbohydrates. This may vary slightly depending on the size and ripeness of the tomatoes. However, keep in mind that these carbs come from natural sugars and fiber, which are beneficial for overall health.\nOn a low-carb diet, it is generally recommended to limit daily carbohydrate intake to around 20-50 grams, depending on individual needs and goals. Including a serving of cherry tomatoes in your meal plan can easily fit within this range. In fact, cherry tomatoes can be a great source of essential nutrients while still keeping your carbohydrate intake low.\nAdditionally, cherry tomatoes are rich in antioxidants, such as lycopene, which has been linked to various health benefits. Lycopene is a powerful antioxidant that helps protect against harmful free radicals and may reduce the risk of certain chronic diseases, including heart disease and certain types of cancer.\nWhen incorporating cherry tomatoes into your low-carb diet, it's important to consider the other components of your meal. For example, if you're enjoying a salad with cherry tomatoes, make sure to choose low-carb toppings and dressings to keep your overall carbohydrate intake in check. Pairing cherry tomatoes with protein and healthy fats, such as avocado or olive oil, can also help balance out your meal and provide a satisfying, nutrient-rich option.\nIn conclusion, cherry tomatoes are a delicious and nutritious addition to a low-carb diet. While they do contain carbohydrates, these are natural sugars and fiber that can be beneficial for overall health. By controlling portion sizes and balancing your meal with other low-carb options, you can enjoy the vibrant flavor of cherry tomatoes without sabotaging your low-carb goals.\nYou may want to see also\nWhat other low-carb options can be paired with cherry tomatoes in a meal?\nCherry tomatoes are a versatile ingredient that can be paired with a variety of low-carb options to create a delicious and satisfying meal. Whether you are following a low-carb diet or simply looking to incorporate more veggies into your meals, cherry tomatoes are a great choice.\nOne popular option is to pair cherry tomatoes with fresh mozzarella and basil to create a Caprese salad. This classic combination is not only low in carbs, but also packed with flavor. To make the salad, simply slice the cherry tomatoes in half and combine them with slices of fresh mozzarella and whole basil leaves. Drizzle with olive oil and balsamic vinegar for added flavor.\nAnother option is to use cherry tomatoes as a topping for grilled chicken or fish. Simply toss the cherry tomatoes in olive oil, salt, and pepper, then grill them until they are slightly charred. This adds a burst of fresh flavor to your protein without adding any extra carbs.\nIf you're looking for a heartier option, consider pairing cherry tomatoes with zucchini noodles. Zucchini noodles, or zoodles, are a low-carb alternative to traditional pasta noodles. Simply spiralize the zucchini, sauté it in olive oil until tender, then toss it with roasted cherry tomatoes and your favorite low-carb sauce. This is a great option for those following a ketogenic diet or looking to reduce their carb intake.\nFor a quick and easy lunch option, try pairing cherry tomatoes with avocado and chicken or tuna. Simply dice the cherry tomatoes and avocado, then mix them together with cooked chicken or tuna. Season with salt, pepper, and your favorite herbs or spices for added flavor. This makes for a delicious and satisfying salad that is low in carbs and high in protein.\nLastly, if you're in the mood for something warm and comforting, consider roasting cherry tomatoes with a medley of low-carb vegetables. Simply toss the cherry tomatoes with vegetables like bell peppers, zucchini, and eggplant, then drizzle with olive oil and season with salt, pepper, and your favorite herbs or spices. Roast in the oven until the vegetables are tender and caramelized. This makes for a flavorful side dish or can be served over cauliflower rice or spaghetti squash for a complete meal.\nIn conclusion, there are many low-carb options that can be paired with cherry tomatoes to create a delicious and satisfying meal. Whether you're in the mood for a fresh salad, a protein-packed dish, or a warm and comforting meal, cherry tomatoes can be incorporated in a variety of ways.

The participants had their vitamin D levels checked within 100 days of their surgery or 100 days after the operation.\nNormal vitamin D levels were found in 21 patients, but 81 transplant recipients were deficient. The rejection rate in the deficient group was more than twice as high as the group with adequate levels of vitamin D. The deficient group also had more than twice as many infections, and their mortality rate was nearly five times higher one year post-transplant.\nThe study authors said 52 percent of the transplant patients received a vitamin D supplement before their surgery. One year later, 75 patients had normal levels of the nutrient and 27 did not.\n\"Given the high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in lung transplant patients and the growing evidence that this supplement helps the immune system tolerate the organ, optimal levels of vitamin D are critical for positive outcomes in these patients,\" Lowery said.\nThe study was published recently in the Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation.\nThe body uses sunlight to make vitamin D.

As the zygotes transition through the cell cycle, these [Ca 2+]i oscillations progressively diminish until they cease in interphase zygotes. While the mechanism(s) underlying the regulation of [Ca2+]i oscillations may be multi-layered, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (IP3Rs) emerge as a focal point in this regulation. IP3Rs, the calcium channels expressed in all cell types and abundantly expressed in mammalian eggs, contain consensus sequences for phosphorylation by various kinases and interact with members of the cytoskeleton, serving as an integrator of regulatory signals. This dissertation highlights the impact of biochemical and cellular changes in IP3R-1 on fertilization-induced [Ca2+]i oscillations. Together with the changes in the cellular distribution of the sperm factor, these cell cycle-dependent modifications in IP3R-1 may underlie the regulation of [Ca 2+]i oscillations in fertilized mammalian eggs.\nLee, Bora, \"The role of inositol 1,4,5 -trisphosphate receptor type-1 in regulation of intracellular calcium oscillations in mouse eggs\" (2007).

{"text":"Please welcome Rhoda as she kindly stops here on her Historical Fiction Virtual Book Tour to discuss her new book. She has brought us a terrific guest post!!!\nThe difficulties suffered by women of past generations who worked in factories to provide for their families is almost unimaginable to us today. Factory work took a toll on women physically, emotionally, and financially. In addition, factory work damaged the relationships with their partners and children.\nPhysically, most factory workers of the past had to endure tiresomely long days. Standing on their feet, in the extreme cold and heat without modern temperature controls must have been unbearable. For most of American history, the factory workers received only Sundays off. At the time, Sunday was considered a day of rest due to stricter applications of biblical preachings. Overnight shifts and holidays were required, and factories often produced a lot of smog and pollution. Not only were the workers covered with soot, but they were inhaling it. They would blow their noses and the soot would be be expelled from the nose onto the handkerchief. Many factories required huge fires or boilers of some sort to produce the energy to power the equipment that was being used. Thus, adding to the extreme temperatures.\nAs second class citizens of decades past, women were often thought of as expendable. They were intimidated by threats that a man could replace them. Many women lost their jobs during pregnancy because the employer did not want to be concerned with physical limitations of the pregnant women. Nor did the employers want to lose an employee during the delivery and recovery period. Unlike seamstress or house servant jobs, factories put women side by side with male co-workers. Many women were sexually harassed or assaulted because the employers and male co-workers realized there was no place for the female worker to go. A woman who had a family could not just quit, file a lawsuit, or collect unemployment. She had to endure the disrespect and violation that her employers or co-workers wished to inflict upon her. It was a trap--a trap that was created by the society of men in power. The laws of the time stated that a woman could not be raped, claiming it was physically impossible. In her 2007 book, Rape: A History from 1860 to the present, author Joanna Bourke quoted directly from medical textbooks of the past that rape was impossible. The medical and legal profession claimed \"it is impossible to sheath a sword into a vibrating scabbard.\" Immigrant women suffered even worse. Signs were often displayed “No Irish Need Apply”, causing more stress for women. This was the reality women faced, not just in the factories, but in all aspects of their lives.\nSome factories who employed women paid them much less than male counterparts. In addition, if the woman was an immigrant she was often paid even less. The only way for such women to be able to work and ensure care for their children would be to live with family. Often there would be groups of people living in one household that functioned as one unit. The large amount of people were often cramped into close quarters because wages were too low to pay for larger homes. It is nearly unfathomable for Americans today to repair shoes, or stuff items in their shoes to prolong wear. Darning socks is a thing of the past. These were amongst the things that were required of low paying factory workers in order to financially survive.\nIn 1975, author Henry \"Hank\" Leiferman wrote of the struggles of one mill worker in his book Crystal Lee: A Woman of Inheritance. Crystal Lee Pulley fought for better working conditions and unionization of her mill. She was fired from the mill, yet gained a position with the union to improve conditions elsewhere. However, since 1976 the American textile industry has lost 2.6 million jobs. Although conditions improved, the jobs eventually disappeared. This left women unemployed and competing with others who were better educated.\nFactory and\/or warehouse life today still causes great hardships for women and their families. Many women are forced to work overnight shifts, weekends, and holidays. Having to work a shift such as 2:30pm to 11:00 pm causes a disconnect in the family because the mother only sees her children an hour or so before sending them off to school in the morning. By the time they return from school, she is already at work. The burdens of childcare costs are staggering. Often the woman is a single mother who lives paycheck to paycheck. Even unionized warehouse or factory establishments which have better conditions overall cause much stress amongst the families.\nAlthough working conditions and the social status of women have improved over the last century, women are still facing obstacles in the workplace. Perhaps looking to their sisters of the past, women of the present can gain the strength to face their own struggles today.\nCreateSpace Independent Publishing\nFormats: eBook, Paperback, Audio Book\nGenre: Historical Fiction\nREAD AN EXCERPT.\nBuy the Book\nAmazon (Audio Book)\nNational Military Family Association\n$1 per sale will be donated, regardless of what format is purchased---ebook, print, audiobook & regardless of site purchased---will be donated to the National Military Family Association.

She began working at the United States Postal Service at 25 years old, and over the past 15 years has accumulated many humorous stories about situations that the public never gets to know about. Her first ebook, \"Goin' Postal: True Stories of a U.S. Postal Worker\" was so popular that readers requested it in paperback. Recently, she published the humorous \"Goin' Postal\" in paperback along with another story entitled, \"The Creek: Where Stories of the Past Come Alive\". Combining these two into one book may seem strange, as one is humorous and the other is a heart wrenching historical fiction, however, doing so proves to the reader Rhoda D'Ettore's versatility.Rhoda D'Ettore received her degree in Human & Social Services while working at USPS, has travelled extensively, and loves history.

Last year, bookmobiles logged over 10,000 miles visiting communities throughout Sacramento County.\nThe two new bookmobiles replaced the 25-year old diesel vehicles thanks to a partnership with the Sacramento Metropolitan Air Quality Management District and California State Library.\n“We were long overdue for a change. The average bookmobile’s lifespan is 10-15 years,” said Cathy Crosthwaite, Sacramento Public Library Deputy Director. “This is one small way we can make an impact in our daily operations. Plus, the new EVs are so much quieter and provide a better experience for our patrons.”\nThe library’s Mobile Services team visits senior sites, residential communities, mobile home parks, and assisted living facilities. Our bookmobiles have served the community since 1948 and operate as mini libraries. Staff customize the collection based on the community’s preferences with materials in various languages, genres and formats. Library users can place items on hold over the phone or online to be checked out from the vehicle.\n“It’s vital that we meet the community where they are and get outside of the library walls. Bookmobiles help us make those connections,” said Todd Deck, Sacramento Public Library Community Engagement Manager. “Our team does their best to reach folks that can’t otherwise get to a library. Bookmobiles also provide social interactions and help foster community between residents and the staff who deliver library services to them.”\nWhen the pandemic hit in March 2020, the library temporarily closed for a few months. The Mobile Services team was the first to resume library services and get back into the community. For many patrons, especially seniors, the bookmobile is one of the few social outlets they have in a month.\nIn 2022, Sacramento Public Library bookmobiles made nearly 800 visits circulating 35,800 materials including books, DVDs, hotspots and more. The library has two regular bookmobile routes. The family route, which focuses on children and families in apartment complexes and other affordable housing communities, visits 10 locations. The senior route visits more than 40 retirement communities, assisted living centers, and mobile home parks on a monthly schedule.\nThis program is funded in part by:","metadata":{"date":1709312014000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947475422.71\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240301161412-20240301191412-00398.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9388421774,"token_count":488,"url":"https:\/\/www.saclibrary.org\/About\/News\/2023\/evbookmobile"},"score":2,"id":"16"}
{"text":"You know those block graphic symbols that allows you to draw lines, corners, intersections, fine bar charts, etc. they are useful and one can do a lot of stuff, but their code arrangements always struck me as arbitrary \/ random. But then maybe I just haven't figured out the logic. Does anybody know why they ended up with the codes they got?\nThe \"PETSCII\" encoding is based on keyboard positions of the original PET chicklet keyboard (*1):\n(Taken from Wikipedia)\nThe keyboard is made similar to basic typewriter keyboards, but ordered in a square fashion, including a top row of symbols but not numbers and a separate numeric keyboard. By every key holding only a single ASCII equivalent symbol (*2), it leads to a direct encoding of ASCII as key position.\nAs a side effect the whole shift level could be used for graphics, as they did. All symols are ordered in a (mostly) useful pattern, like having\nUIJK forming the 4 sections of a circle,\nOPL: doing the same for the corners of a large square and\n0.-=the same for a small square.\nIt not only looks neat on the keyboard but also makes a good UI as far as ordering of symbols can get.\nThe downside is that graphic symbols are encoded according to the (unsifted) character code. And here combinations like\nUIJK are simply non-continuous. As listing the PETSCII assignment shows:\n(Taken from Wikipedia)\nFrom a programmers perspective this is less than perfect. A logical sequence for related items (*3) could have been more helpful. This is especially true for the 16 codes that form a 2x2 division of a character cell would allow an easy 'bitmap' mode for 80x48 pixel (*4). Much like contemporary TRS-80 and Sinclair's ZX80\/81 some years later.\nAn additionally sad part is that PETSCII itself isn't direct used for display, but translated into screencodes beforehand. If not right ahead, this would have been a good point to reorder.\n... and so it became history :)\n*1 - The Wikipedia entry for 'Chicklet Keyboard' is a nice example for a retrograde explanation.\n*2 - Almost as if the first version was not meant to use shift.\n*3 - Much like ASCII offers a monotone sequence for numbers ($30..$39) and letters ($41..$5A). The later according to the usual lexical sequence, as made popular by Bartholomeus Anglicus.\n*4 - As usual they have been used anyway, but with a translation layer. Some of them, written in BASIC, look more like on purpose obfuscation.\nI think the codes were laid out so that when laid out sensibly on the PET keyboard, the shifted and unshifted forms of each key would have a consistent relationship. When the VIC-20 reduced the number of keys but added the Commodore key, this made it necessary to rearrange the placement of graphics on the keys; since Commodore kept the same arrangement of character codes, however, this meant that the arrangement no longer seemed to make as much sense.\nOne can see a similar effect in the design of ASCII. Many typewriters used to use a shifted 2 for a quotation mark, early teletypes did likewise, and thus the ASCII code for the quote mark is one bit different from that of the digit 2, even though modern keyboards use a shifted apostrophe as the quote mark.","metadata":{"date":1709108341000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947474700.89\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240228080245-20240228110245-00699.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9505418539,"token_count":726,"url":"https:\/\/retrocomputing.stackexchange.com\/questions\/15706\/c64-petscii-block-graphic-symbol-was-there-ever-a-logical-reason-for-their-asc\/15709"},"score":4,"id":"17"}

{"text":"A lamb is a young sheep that is still weak and defenseless when unprotected and alone. Because of this, lambs are targeted by predators because they present easy prey to them. When lambs are left on their own, they either get hunted down or stuck and lost, so they need guidance.\nThese are the qualities that make lambs so symbolic. They are a sign of innocence, purity, vulnerability, and sacrifice. Many of these symbols overlap with the symbolism of youth.\nLambs have been sacrificial animals throughout the entire human history – even the Ancient Greeks and Romans used lambs as sacrificial animals. Later, lambs became symbolic of Jesus Christ’s sacrifice for his followers.\nIn this article, we’ll discuss the symbolism of lambs in Christianity, literature, and life. You’ll find some interesting meanings that you perhaps didn’t know about before.\nThe 8 Symbolisms of Lamb in Life\nAs such, lambs are innocent animals that are still naive and new to life. They don’t have the experience or the ability to protect themselves, so they stick to groups instead of wandering away on their own. They’re also oblivious to the dangers around them.\nBecause of that, lambs represent innocence – sometimes, even human innocence. They are not aware of what is out there and what the world looks like – they need to be guided and protected by the group.\nLambs are small and weak, and they do not become sheep until the age of 1. They can’t protect themselves alone, so they need to stay in groups or be protected by their parents. If they stray away from the group, the likelihood of their survival is close to zero.\nIt is this vulnerability of lambs that made them so symbolic, even in Christianity. They’ve become the symbol of God because they represent the weakest, vulnerable part of God, the part which is always willing to give to humans.\nNot only lambs, but sheep can be a representative of an individual’s vulnerability. As spirit animals, sheep (and lamb) denote that someone is vulnerable in their character. It’s symbolic of someone who needs support from others in times of need when things get tough, just like lambs do when they are in danger.\nRead Article: Black Sheep Spiritual Meaning and Symbolism\nAs lambs are fresh and new to the world, they are free from sin. This is one of the most revered qualities of Christianity and a huge reason why lambs are so symbolic in Christianity, too.\nThe wolf is impure, while the lamb is pure and weak. The wolf is the hunter, greedy, and looking for food, which can represent the dark side of our character. On the other hand, we have lambs that are pure and vulnerable, and sometimes even weak. In a way, it’s a collision of two different parts of our character.\nLambs have always been sacrificial animals. From the Ancient Greeks and Romans to Christians and even later civilizations, lambs were used for sacrifice to a higher purpose. In most cases, it was the sacrifice to Gods.\nAccording to Merriam-Webster, the term sacrificial lamb represents something or someone that’s sacrificed for the greater good.\nEven today, lambs are used for sacrifice in Passover sacrifice, which was an important part of the Israelite faith. Today, it’s only practiced by Samaritans at Mount Gerizim. In most cases, the sacrifice of lambs represents something that’s beneficial for the greater good of the community.\nIn the Abrahamic religion, a lamb was and is a very highly valued possession. This term of the sacrifice of the lambs is widely present in everyday life, too. A good example of this is in politics, where a sacrificial lamb is a candidate in elections who has little or no chance of winning an election but is still representing the party for the greater good.\nWe’ll touch on the meaning of the sacrifice of lambs in Christianity later on, because there are many references to it in the Bible, too.\nLambs are also highly symbolic of family. They are often depicted in Ancient paintings and works of art together with a sheep and a ram, which is obviously a symbol for the family. The lamb is the child, the sheep is the mother, and the ram is the father.\nWhen we think about it, lambs can also represent children in a way. They are both young, naive, and new to the world, and also not aware of the real world around them. They are oblivious to the bad things happening in the world, and also somewhat unable to survive with the help of their parents. They represent the same qualities, such as innocence and purity.\n7. Herd Behavior\nHerd behavior is obviously typical for animals – they form herds without a centralized leader for the purpose of staying safe and without directions. Lambs can represent that to an extent. It also represents a degree of naivety and a lack of introspection where individuals follow vague beliefs and directions from someone else. Without a “shepherd”, they are lost.\nSometimes, this term is coined in financial settings where investors follow other investors blindly based on prior results or false beliefs.\nThis symbolism is similar to the symbolism of childhood. Lambs don’t know how to decide for themselves, so they follow others. And when they do that, they might not follow the best examples – they only follow the ones they find the strongest and most convincing.\nThis naivety can lead them astray in their later years. Just like teenagers get lost, lambs and sheep can get lost themselves and might find themselves in danger. They can either get stuck somewhere or be hunted by predators.\nThe Symbolism of Lambs in Christianity\nLambs are one of the central symbols of Christianity. They represent sacrifice and purity, two of the most important pillars of the Christian faith. As such, they are highly symbolic of God himself, who is pure and sacrifices himself for his followers.\nLamb also signifies innocence in Christianity. It’s symbolic of everything that’s innocent, including Jesus Christ himself. This is visible in several passages of the Bible, including this passage from Isaiah:\n“The wolf shall dwell within the lamb, and the leopard shall lie down with the kid; and the calf and the young lion and the fatling together, and a little child shall lead them.”\nIn this passage, the lamb is described as this conforming and innocent animal that’s seeking guidance. In this passage, the wolf denotes anyone that’s against innocent and the lamb represents innocence, which is the opposite of the wolf.\nIn Christianity, lambs are also sacrificial animals, which is often denoted in the Bible itself, too. They also represent Jesus Christ’s sacrifice for his followers and the sacrifices we make for the greater good.\nThis is visible in the Book of Genesis where Abraham sacrifices the lamb which is provided by God, which is the perfect sacrificial offering.\nHowever, perhaps the most notable symbolism of the lamb in Christianity is that of the true Lamb of God. The lamb of God is also synonymous with Jesus himself, who is seen as the sacrifice for the rest of his followers and for the rest of humanity. This is portrayed by John the Baptist in his passage (1:29):\n“Behold, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin from the world!”\nJesus becomes the Lamb of God, and he is defenseless and is led to death freely. He frees his followers from sin and death. This symbolism has become legendary in Christianity and perhaps the most notable mention of the lamb in the Bible. As such, the main meaning of the lamb in the Bible is that of sacrifice.\nThe Symbolism of Lambs in Literature\nBecause lambs are so symbolic, they are often present in literature, too.\nOne of the most notable examples is the poem by William Blake called The Lamb. In this poem, the lamb is the subject and the main “protagonist”. It represents the perfect creation by God, and it gives wool to humans, which is a gift from God himself. Also, Blake describes the voice of the lamb as “tender”.\nThe entire setting of the poem seems somewhat idyllic and pastoral. Perhaps the lamb is symbolic also of beauty and perfection, and also of the nature that is so beautiful (which is described in the poem).\nBy the end of the poem, the term lamb is synonymous with God who created the lamb. God is represented by a small child and the lamb is his creation.\nLambs are historically and symbolically very notable animals. They’ve been used as sacrificial animals centuries ago, even by Ancient Greeks and Romans. They represent innocence, purity, and sacrifice. They are also symbolic of naivety, childhood, family, and also belonging.\nBecause of their traits and features, lambs are highly symbolic also in Christianity and literature, as well as in other faiths (Israelites and Abrahamism). It’s interesting to explore the symbolism of lamb and the different meanings of lamb – some are even unexpected!\nI’m Chris and I run this website – a resource about symbolism, metaphors, idioms, and a whole lot more!

{"text":"Shunt Clipping Circuits:\nA positive Shunt Clipping Circuits is illustrated in Fig. 3-28(a). Here the diode is connected in shunt (or parallel) with the output terminals. When the input is negative, the diode is reverse biased and only a small voltage drop occurs across RI, due to load current IL. This means that the circuit output voltage (Vo) is approximately equal to the negative input peak (-E). When the input is +E, D1 is forward biased, and the output voltage equals the diode voltage drop (+VF). Thus, the positive half of the waveform is clipped off. As illustrated, the upper and lower levels of the output of a positive shunt clipper are approximately +VF and -E.\nA negative Shunt Clipping Circuits is exactly the same as a positive shunt clipper with the diode polarity reversed, [see Fig. 3-28(b)]. The negative half-cycle of the waveform is clipped off.\nAs in the case of series clipping circuits, Shunt Clipping Circuits may be used with square, sinusoidal, or other input waveforms.\nShunt Noise Clipper:\nThe shunt noise clipper shown in Fig. 3-30 removes noise riding on the peaks of an input waveform. The signal amplitude must be greater than the diode forward voltage drop. The output waveform is clipped, at ±VF , so that the noise is not passed to the output. This type of clipper is used with pulse signals, where the pulse amplitude is not important. In this case, information is contained in the pulse width, or simply in its presence or absence.\nBiased Shunt Clipper:\nFigure 3-31 shows a clipping circuit that uses two diodes which have different bias voltages. The cathode of D1 is connected to a +2 V bias (VB1), and the anode of D2 has a -2 V bias (VB2). While the input waveform amplitude is less than ±(VB + VF), neither diode is forward biased, and the input is simply passed to the output. When the positive input is greater than (VB1 + VF). D1 becomes forward biased, and the output cannot exceed this voltage. Similarly, when the negative input goes below (-VB2 – VF). D2 is forward biased, and the output is limited to -(VB2 + VF).\nFor obvious reasons, the circuit is termed a biased Shunt Clipping Circuits. Biased shunt clippers are used to protect circuits or devices from (positive\/negative) input voltages that must not exceed specified levels.\nThe voltage across resistor R1 is (E – Vo), and the resistor current is the sum of the load current and the diode forward current (IL + IF). As in other diode circuits, a minimum level of IF is selected, and the resistor value is calculated as,\nZener Diode Shunt Clipper:\nA Zener diode shunt clipper produces the same kind of result as a biased shunt clipper without the need for bias voltages. The clipper circuit in Fig. 3-32 has two back-to-back series-connected Zener diodes.\nWhen the input voltage is positive and has sufficient amplitude, D1 is forward bias and D2 is biased into reverse breakdown. At this time, the output voltage is limited to (VF + VZ2). A negative input voltage produces a maximum negative output of -(VF + VZ1). With equal-voltage Zener diodes, the maximum output voltage is,\nThe resistor voltage is (E – Vo), and the resistor current is (IL + IZ).

Although I think casino slots are a legitimate form of gambling, they’re not as thrilling as real mone trustly withdrawal casinoy gambling. While you can get pretty comfortable with slots by playing them in the presence of a lamp or sipping your favorite drink but ultimately, it’s the ability that will win. Here are some information about slots.\nThere are two fundamental sets of spins no matter the casino where you play at home: one for the console, one for the computer and the other for consoles. The ball spins for one time when you place your wager. Then it stops. The staff at the casino will inform you when the ball needs to stop and begin with the next spin. The direction that the ball spins depends on the symbols that are visible on the reels. The symbol the ball is spinning on determines the direction it will take. If the symbol for up is used to indicate that the ball is moving upwards, that is the direction in which the ball will travel.\nAt online casinos you will see a random number generator (RNG). It is a set of computer software that generates numbers that determine the symbols that will be displayed on the reels. When a player plays at casinos online, they utilize one of these random numbers generators. This software ensures pay by mobile casino free spins that the bets placed upon random chance.\nRandom number generators determine the outcome of every spin on the casino slot machine. At online casinos , the outcome of each spin is decided by a program which is downloaded on your PC. A random number generator is installed on your PC, and you can begin spinning a slot machine whenever you wish. Many people believe that because they know the outcome of the random number generator, they are somehow cheating. You could increase your chances of win by cheating the machine.\nYou have a higher chance of winning than the house edge of the casino. The house advantage refers to the percentage of slot machine profits that casino owners make. Casinos have a higher percentage of slots playing, which means they are more likely to be successful. Casino owners earn more from their progressive slots due to the fact that they own more of them.\nCasinos online are designed to allow players to play for as long as they like. You can quit playing in the event that you become bored. Many players prefer to benefit from bonuses that do not require deposit that some casinos online offer. Online slot players who wager big winnings have a better chance of double their initial bet.\nPlaying for free or progressive slots can allow you to make real money. There are no limitations on how much money you can earn. You will need an Internet connection to play for free online slot machines at casinos.\nEach machine spins an entirely different set of coins. Random elements will determine the combinations that the machines generate.

{"text":"\"Kapila said, 'The Vedas are regarded as authoritative by all. People never\ndisregard them. Brahma is of two kinds, viz., Brahma as represented by sound, and Brahma as Supreme (and intangible). 1 One conversant with Brahma represented by sound succeeds in attaining to Supreme Brahma. Commencing with the rites of Garbhadhana, that body which the sire creates with the aid of Vedic mantras is cleansed (after birth) by Vedic mantras. 2 When the body has been cleansed with purificatory rites (performed with the aid of Vedic mantras), the owner there of come to be called a Brahmana and becomes a vessel fit for receiving knowledge of Brahma. Know that the reward of acts is purity of heart which only leads to Emancipation. I shall presently speak to thee of that. Whether purity of heart has been attained or not (by performance of acts) is what can be known to the person himself who has attained it. It can never be known with the aid of either the Vedas or inference. They that cherish no expectation, that discard every kind of wealth by not storing anything for future use, that are not covetous, and that are free from every kind of affection and aversion, perform sacrifices because of the conviction that their performance is a duty. To make gifts unto deserving persons is the end (right use) of all wealth. Never addicted at any time to sinful acts, observant of those rites that have been laid down in the Vedas, capable of crowning all their wishes with fruition, endued with certain conclusions through pure knowledge, never giving way to wrath,--never indulging in envy, free from pride and malice, firm in Yoga, 3 of unstained birth, unstained conduct, and unstained learning, devoted to the good of all creatures, there were in days of yore many men, leading lives of domesticity and thoroughly devoted to their own duties, there were many kings also of the same qualifications, devoted to Yoga (like Janaka, etc.), and many Brahmanas also of the same character (like Yajnavalkya and others). 4 They behaved equally towards all creatures and were endued with perfect sincerity. Contentment was theirs, and certainty of knowledge. Visible were the rewards of their righteousness, and pure were they in behaviour and heart. They were possessed of faith in Brahma of both forms. 5 At first making their hearts pure, they duly observed all (excellent) vows. They were observant of the duties of righteousness on even occasions of distress and difficulty, without failing off in any particular. Uniting together they used to perform meritorious acts. In this they found great happiness. And inasmuch as they never tripped, they had never to perform any expiation. Relying as they did\nupon the true course of righteousness, they became endued with irresistible energy. They never followed their own understandings in the matter of earning merit but followed the dictates of the scriptures alone for that end. Accordingly they were never guilty of guile in the matter of performing acts of righteousness. 1 In consequence of their observing unitedly the absolute ordinances of the scriptures without betaking themselves ever to the rites laid down in the alternative, they were never under the necessity of performing expiation. 2 There is no expiation for men living in the observance of the ordinances laid down in the scriptures. The Sruti declares that expiation exists for only men that are weak and unable to follow the absolute and substantive provisions of the sacred law. Many Brahmanas there were of this kind in days of old, devoted to the performance of sacrifices, of profound knowledge of the Vedas, possessed of purity and good conduct, and endued with fame. They always worshipped Brahma in the sacrifices, and were free from desire. Possessed of learning they transcended all the bonds of life. The sacrifices of these men, their (knowledge of the) Vedas, their acts performed in obedience to the ordinances, their study of the scripture at the fixed hours, and the wishes they entertained, freed as they were from lust and wrath, observant as they were of pious conduct and acts notwithstanding all difficulties, renowned as they were for performing the duties of their own order and mode of life, purified as their souls were in consequence of their very nature, characterised as they were by thorough sincerity, devoted as they were to tranquillity, and mindful as they were of their own practices, were identical with Infinite Brahma. Even this is the eternal Sruti heard by us. 3 The penances of men that were so high-souled, of men whose conduct and acts were so difficult of observance and accomplishment, of men whose wishes were crowned with fruition in consequence of the strict discharge of their duties, became efficacious weapons for the destruction of all earthly desires. The Brahmanas say that that Good Conduct, which is wonderful, whose origin may be traced to very ancient times, which is eternal and whose characteristics are unchangeable, which differs from the practices to which even the good resort in seasons of distress and represents their acts in other situations, which is identical with heedfulness, over which lust and wrath and other evil passions can never prevail, and in consequence of which there was (at one time) no transgression in all mankind, subsequently came to be distributed into four subdivisions, corresponding with the four modes of life by persons unable to\npractise its duties in minute detail and entirety. 1 They that are good, by duly observing that course of Good Conduct after adoption of the Sannyasa mode of life, attain to the highest end. They also that betake themselves to the forest mode reach the same high end (by duly observing that conduct). They too that observe the domestic mode of life attain to the highest end (by duly practising the same conduct); and, lastly, those that lead the Brahmacharya mode obtain the same (end by a due observance of the same conduct). 2 Those Brahmanas are seen to shine in the firmament as luminaries shedding beneficent rays of light all around. Those myriads of Brahmanas have become stars and constellations set in their fixed tracks. In consequence of contentment (or Renunciation) they have all attained to Infinity as the Vedas declare. If such men have to come back to the world through the wombs of living creatures, they are never stained by sins which have the unexhausted residue of previous acts for their originating cause. Indeed, one who has led the life of a Brahmacharin and waited dutifully upon his preceptor, who has arrived at settled conclusions (in respect of the soul), and who has devoted himself to Yoga thus, is truly a Brahmana. Who else would deserve to be called a Brahmana? When acts alone determine who is a Brahmana and who is not, acts (good or bad) must be held to indicate the happiness or misery of a person. As regards those that have by conquering all evil passions acquired purity of heart, we have heard the eternal Sruti that in consequence of the Infinity to which they attain (through beholding the universal soul) and of the knowledge of Brahma (they acquire through the declarations of Srutis), they behold everything to be Brahma. The duties (of tranquillity, self-restraint, abstention from acts, renunciation, devotion, and the abstraction of Samadhi) followed by those men of pure hearts, that are freed from desire, and that have Emancipation only for their object, for acquisition of the knowledge of Brahma, are equally laid down for all the four orders of men and all the four modes of life. Verily, that knowledge is always acquired by Brahmanas of pure hearts and restrained soul. 3 One whose soul is for Renunciation\nbased upon contentment is regarded as the refuge of true knowledge. Renunciation, in which is that knowledge which leads to Emancipation, and which is highly necessary for a Brahmana, is eternal (and comes down from preceptor to pupil for ever and ever). 1 Renunciation sometimes exists mixed with the duties of other modes. But whether existing in that state or by itself, one practises it according to the measure of one's strength (that depends upon the degree of one's absence of worldly desires). Renunciation is the cause of supreme benefit unto every kind of person. Only he that is weak, fails to practise it. That pure-hearted man who seeks to attain to Brahma becomes rescued from the world (with its misery).' 2\n\"Syumarasmi said, 'Amongst those that are given up to enjoyment (of property), they that make gifts, they that perform sacrifices, they that devote themselves to the study of the Vedas, and they that betake themselves to a life of Renunciation after having acquired and enjoyed wealth and all its pleasures, when they depart from this world, who is it that attains to the foremost place in heaven? I ask thee this, O Brahmana! Do thou tell me truly.'\n\"Kapila said, 'Those who lead a life of domesticity are certainly auspicious and acquire excellence of every kind. They are unable, however, to enjoy the felicity that attaches to Renunciation. Even thou mayst see this.' 3\n\"Syumarasmi said, 'Ye depend upon knowledge as the means (for the attainment of Emancipation). Those who lead lives of domesticity have planted their faith in acts. It has, however, been said that the end of all modes of life is Emancipation. 4 No difference, therefore, is observable between them in respect of either their superiority or inferiority of puissance. O illustrious one, do thou tell me then how stands the matter truly.'\n\"Kapila said, 'Acts only cleanse the body. Knowledge, however, is the highest end (for which one strives). 5 When all faults of the heart are cured (by acts), and when the felicity of Brahma becomes established in knowledge,\nbenevolence, forgiveness, tranquillity, compassion, truthfulness, and candour, abstention from injury, absence of pride, modesty, renunciation, and abstention from work are attained. These constitute the path that lead to Brahma. By those one attains to what is the Highest. That the cure of all faults of the heart is the result of acts becomes intelligible to the wise man when these are attained. That, indeed, is regarded as the highest end which is obtained by Brahmanas endued with wisdom, withdrawn from all acts, possessed of purity and the certitude of knowledge. One who succeeds in acquiring a knowledge of the Vedas, of that which is taught by the Vedas (viz., Brahma as represented in acts), and the minutiae of acts, is said to be conversant with the Vedas. Any other man is only a bag of wind. 1 One who is conversant with the Vedas knows everything, for everything is established on the Vedas. Verity, the present, past, and future all exist in the Vedas. 2 This one conclusion is deducible from all the scriptures, viz., that this universe exists and does not exist. To the man of knowledge this (all that is perceived) is both sat and asat. To him, this all is both the end and the middle. 3 This truth rests upon all the Vedas, viz., that when complete Renunciation takes place one obtains what is sufficient. Then again the highest contentment follows and rests upon Emancipation, 4 which is absolute, which exists as the soul of all mortal and immortal things, which is well-known as such universal soul, which is the highest object of knowledge as being identical with all mobile and immobile things, which is full, which is perfect felicity, which is without duality, which is the foremost of all things, which is Brahma, which is Unmanifest and the cause also, whence the Unmanifest has sprung, and which is without deterioration of any kind. 5 Ability to subdue the senses, forgiveness, and abstention from work in consequence of the absence of desire,--these three are the cause of perfect felicity. With the aid of these three qualities, men having understanding for their eyes succeed in reaching that Brahma which is\nuncreate, which is the prime cause of the universe, which is unchangeable and which is beyond destruction. I bow to that Brahma, which is identical with him that knows it.'\" 1","metadata":{"date":1709008676000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947474670.19\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240227021813-20240227051813-00797.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9777814746,"token_count":2612,"url":"http:\/\/bharatadesam.com\/spiritual\/mahabharata\/mahabharata_12b097.php"},"score":2,"id":"22"}

We will correct it.\nDavid: If you even hear us, tell us.\nWoody: You have this thing that people aren't hearing this, but obviously people are hearing this.\nDavid: Paul Rosenberg for one.\nWoody: That's right. But what are we gonna talk about today? That was last week. This week we have some new, interesting West Side historic topic. What is it, David?\nDavid: We're gonna talk about the Sunnyside Conservatory.\nWoody: Conservatory? Is that a place where perhaps music is played?\nDavid: It could be.\nWoody: But not in this particular case, I don't think.\nDavid: I think sometimes it is played there.\nWoody: Aha! What is the Sunnyside Conservatory? Okay, wait. I know where the Sunnyside is and we should probably talk about that first. The Sunnyside is, despite its name, a foggy part of [00:02:00] town.\nDavid: That's not right.\nWoody: It is. Trust me. It's north of, well, it's kind of on both sides of Monterey Boulevard.\nWoody: Between Glen Park and roughly City College.\nWoody: Right, that area, that's called the Sunnyside.\nDavid: Monterey Boulevard is the main artery through the Sunnyside.\nWoody: In fact, Monterey Boulevard used to be called Sunnyside Avenue.\nWoody: When it was first, when that little tract was being developed, it was named by Joost. Behrend Joost was the guy who was behind the Sunnyside.\nDavid: So, he named Sunnyside Avenue? Did he name Joost Street? Is it Street?\nWoody: Yeah, that's named after him. I don't even know if it's Sunnyside Avenue. It could be Sunnyside Street, now I think about it. But yeah, Joost.\nDavid: We're just gonna hedge our bets on every fact we have from now on.\nWoody: We don't wanna be corrected ever again. It's always sunny in the Sunnyside. Anyway, but it was an 1890s land development scheme to create the [00:03:00] Sunnyside neighborhood. And so, that is where the Sunnyside Conservatory is, I assume.\nDavid: That's right. It's right on Monterey Boulevard. You can't miss it.\nWoody: 236, I believe is the address, and I think it was built, see, I do know something about it. I'm revealing that I do know something about this. This building was built in the early 1900s, probably just after 1900. So, what’s a conservatory? The other conservatory I think of is the Conservatory of Flowers in Golden Gate Park.\nWoody: And so, a conservatory is a place where you might grow plants or something.\nDavid: Right. And anyway, it's kind of a, the Sunnyside Conservatory is an octagonal building, does it have eight sides? It's kind of octagonal, it's a tall…\nWoody: I think it does have eight sides.\nDavid: Window, window-lined building that lets the light in. And I believe that it was made to grow plants in, by the owners.\nWoody: Right. [00:04:00] The guy who bought it, a little research was done, and the gentleman who first bought that land bought a number of lots in the Sunnyside neighborhood together. So, he had a big plot of land and his last name was Merralls. And the conservatory seemed to have been a building that was built to probably raise hot house flowers or plants that would thrive in a sort of conservatory environment.\nDavid: Right. So, it was private.\nDavid: It was his own place in his own yard.\nWoody: That's right. And it has some interesting little stories that have been passed down through the years though. But your memory of the Sunnyside Conservatory, when you first became aware of it, was it being used as a conservatory?\nDavid: No, it was kind of a, it was a public park-ish place where you could walk in. They had one of the park, I think Park and Rec ran it.\nDavid: Except that it was very decrepit. It was open to the elements. A lot of the windows were broken. There really wasn’t, there weren't [00:05:00] many people hanging around there except for people drinking beer and stuff, I think.\nWoody: Were these people your friends?\nDavid: Some of them. Some of the people drinking beer there were my friends. Some of them were just acquaintances.\nWoody: Yeah, so the time you're remembering, it's the time I remember probably in the early ‘80s, mid-‘80s. And it was this kind of park land that was right along Monterey Boulevard with this building and all the trees and everything were overgrown and the building kind of was just sticking out of this bushy tree, technically a city park.\nWoody: Because the conservatory was actually made a city landmark, a San Francisco city landmark in 1975.\nWoody: So, it had been noted as a notable building.\nWoody: In San Francisco. And it was the landmark of the Sunnyside District for sure. It really kind of sticks out as an interesting building. And we talk about it being octagonal and, you know, people used to think that eight [00:06:00] sided buildings were somehow more healthy. There was this strange sort of belief, and for a long time, people were, there was a fad of building eight-sided houses because they thought it brought in more light and it was just better for your health. So, the conservatory, maybe the gentleman thought that an eight-sided conservatory was better for his plants. I don't know.\nWoody: Anyway, I was gonna say there's some interesting stories that have kind of, it's more legends and lore that have come down through the years about the conservatory. One story that I’ve heard, which I really don't believe, but I like, was that a woman who bought the land after Merralls had died and she had just bought the land and the lots and all the plants around it. There was a house also on the lot. She didn't know the conservatory was there because it was so overgrown, the patch of land, until her dog ran into the bushes and she went to retrieve him and said, “What the heck? There's a giant octagonal building in the middle of my plot of land.” [00:07:00]\nWoody: I don't think that's true, but that is a good story.\nWoody: Yeah. I guess I was trying to say how sort of decrepit and overgrown the land was. But the first, let's talk a little bit about what was going on there. The other story I had heard was the guy who originally owned it, who I think was the original owner, was an inventor. And one of the things he was trying to invent was a balloon or an aircraft. You know, everybody was trying to build aircraft.\nDavid: A dirigible.\nWoody: Yeah. Something in the early 20th century. And that was, he was…\nDavid: I don't know if a dirigible is a balloon or not, or if it's an air ship. I don't know.\nWoody: Yeah. Anyway, I don't think he was a great inventor. And he actually got run over by a train, was how he actually died unfortunately.\nDavid: One of Joost’s trains running up Sunnyside Avenue?\nWoody: It might have been because Behrend Joost also brought the first electric streetcar system to San Francisco. Another sideline there.\nDavid: Right. So, I've seen pictures of [00:08:00] Sunnyside Avenue. I want to branch out a little bit onto, into the Sunnyside. And so, where was, the two main structures around that time in Sunnyside was the conservatory and Joost’s powerhouse.\nWoody: Right. For the electric railway you're saying?\nWoody: Yeah. And that was all the way at the edge, like near Acadia, kind of going over towards where you can get on 280 now, getting towards the Glen Park side. Yeah, but there was a giant powerhouse for the electric railway that Behrend Joost had. That went from San Francisco all the way down to I think San Mateo. And it was a big move forward in transit technology in San Francisco, the first electric streetcar.\nDavid: Was it the precursor to the old interurban San Mateo car?\nWoody: I don't know if it ran on the same track or not. I get to talk to one of my transit historian friends about that. The first guy who owned those lots though was actually a streetcar guy. A streetcar gripman, somebody who worked on streetcars, [00:09:00] Charles H. Taylor. And I think he might have had bought the land so that it was a larger plot of land. But we think it was this guy W.A. Merralls who built the conservatory. He was British and I think he had a background in the mining industry and he invented gasoline motors. You know, one of these tinkerers. Yeah, sort of Thomas Edison types. But definitely was into aircraft and biplanes and tried to form a company.\nDavid: Okay, so, Taylor buys the land from Joost, and then Merralls builds a conservatory.\nDavid: And then what?\nWoody: And originally it was an octagon building, but it had a couple of wings on each side. And he was interested, I think, in exotic plants and trees. And he just created this pleasure ground essentially as part of the land. And he had a separate house that was part of it all.\nDavid: But he, so he got killed?\nWoody: He did. He got run over by a train. [00:10:00]\nWoody: And then his wife, his widow, her name was Temperance. And this is going to give you an idea of what her plans are for the conservatory. She wanted to create a sanitarium there, using the conservatory building as a sanitarium.\nDavid: It's just a part of it. I mean, it's not that big.\nWoody: Like a private sanitarium, I think, where people go, and this was a sanitarium, a place where alcoholics could go and sort of dry out. So, she was very much against alcohol.\nDavid: So, Sunnyside was out in the country.\nDavid: Only there was a couple of buildings, a few buildings out there.\nWoody: A lot of farm land.\nDavid: A lot of farms.\nWoody: And, you know, back then people didn't know about alcoholism as much as they know now. And so, there were all these different methods and treatments that people would try to come up with to cure it. You know, it wasn't thought of, you know, we didn't have the 12 steps and programs and all that. So, this was one of these treatment programs she came up with. She wanted to [00:11:00] call it the Sunnyside Laboratories and have sort of a, a treatment program for alcoholics using the conservatory building.\nDavid: Huh? Well, I'm glad I didn't know that when my acquaintances were drinking beer there.\nWoody: They wouldn't have been inspired to stop?\nDavid: No. But so what, but she ran out of money?\nWoody: Right. Right. She went bankrupt.\nDavid: And she lost the whole place.\nWoody: Right. Lost it to the bank. I think she was foreclosed on.\nWoody: That's right. And then in, I think in 1920s roughly, new people moved in, and that's where I think that dog story came from. The people who bought it after her supposedly bought the land from the bank and then found out there was this big conservatory building in the middle of the patch of wilderness next to their house. So, that was the Van Becks, that was their name, Van Becks. But they were kind of well-known in the Sunnyside. They were, I guess you could consider, like they had the biggest place and the biggest land. And so, they had a [00:12:00] lot of influence on improvements in trying to make the Sunnyside a nicer neighborhood at the time.\nDavid: Right. And over the time, I mean, so the original person, Taylor, bought seven lots around and built the, or did not build the conservatory, but had, it was a big plot of land. And over time, these successive owners each built their own homes and subdivided those, I mean, not subdivided, but they were all lots by themselves.\nDavid: And so, the conservatory wilderness land those lots, that it was on, successively got smaller. The park.\nWoody: Yeah. Yeah. And actually, the guy, one of the owners down the line, the old house that was part of the conservatory land…\nWoody: Actually got separated out at some point and was not part of the land anymore. And the guy who kind of helped fix up the conservatory, cause remember we're talking about a glass building at some point…\nDavid: Well, it's made of wood with a lot of windows.\nWoody: Right. But it had had been broken and people were throwing rocks through them. And this guy, [00:13:00] Walter Anderson, who owned the land, did a lot of restoration, which included boarding up a lot of the window openings, because he was just trying to keep it up and make it a nicer looking building. He died in 1973 and his wife sold the property to another couple for $70,000. This is great. In 1973, you could buy all this land for $70,000.\nDavid: Yeah, but we only made a dollar and a quarter an hour.\nWoody: Yeah, I had a paper route. No, I didn't have paper route. Anyway, the guy who bought it from them for $70,000, they wanted to tear down the conservatory because you know, it's valuable land. You could build a bunch of houses and stuff. And that really got the Sunnyside neighborhood all riled up. They formed a neighborhood association. And they really fought to save the building, and that's when it was made a landmark. Remember I said it was a landmark in ‘75?\nDavid: Oh yeah. City Landmark Number 78.\nWoody: Yeah. Anyway, so there was a big push to save it. There was still some scares about it being [00:14:00] demolished. The wings got taken down in the late ‘70s.\nDavid: But there's some weird stuff there. I mean, it's a landmark in 1975.\nDavid: But then the owner still was able to secure a demolition permit in 1978?\nWoody: There was some mistakes made, I think. I think it was some bureaucratic errors. He wasn't supposed to get the demo permit, cause it was a city landmark.\nDavid: Right. So…\nWoody: He did, and he started tearing it down.\nDavid: Today there's one wing on the eight-sided building, but in 1975 there were two wings. There was another wing on the other side.\nDavid: And in 1978, the other wing that's gone now was demolished by the owner in that sketchy demolition permit.\nWoody: Yeah. It shouldn't have been issued. And then a lot of the original window sashes, a lot of stuff was done to it to kind of tear off original material. But it was saved, thank goodness, in the late ‘70s, early ‘80s. And then, that's when the park was sort of added to the Rec and Park [00:15:00] land. Because the building was saved as a, in a sense, as a landmark, but all the land around it wasn't a park until the 1980s. And, but as you know David, city parks have a way of sometimes going through good times and bad times.\nWoody: And so, even after it was a city park, we have a city landmark. People like you were going in that park.\nDavid: Who appreciated the place for its solitude and a pastoral environment.\nWoody: Yes. So, it was a good place for teenagers trying to drink, to hide in the bushes and drink. Right? So…\nDavid: It wasn't a convenient place for me to go. Okay. I mean, I went there because I had an interest in history. I'm like, what's this place? Sunnyside Conservatory.\nWoody: Oh, so you're saying it was your, your interest in history that had you drinking beer in these parks.\nDavid: And my interest in drinking beer.\nWoody: You know, it's funny, we're doing this and I see here on your desk you have a six pack of Rock & Roll beer [00:16:00] that I think probably dates from…\nDavid: 1980, I think.\nWoody: 1980. So, you could have been drinking this Rock & Roll beer. It's all rusty now. You could have been drinking in ’82, drinking this at the Sunnyside Conservatory.\nDavid: Yeah, it's possible. It's possible.\nWoody: But as I remember, even though in the ‘80s, even into the ‘90s, it was still kind of run down. I think there was still homeless people kind of camping in there occasionally. Vandalism, graffiti. It had kind of fallen on hard times.\nDavid: Yeah, it was all open, as I say, it was open to the elements and, and t was kind of like you're in a gazebo sort of thing. I mean, it wasn't really an enclosed building.\nWoody: Right. But that's changed. And you were at the big dedication. So, there was a bond issue and there was a lot of work put into it. And then in 2009, December 5th, they had the rededication, reopening of the Sunnyside Conservatory. And it's a very different place now, isn't it?\nDavid: Yeah, yeah. It's beautifully remodeled and [00:17:00] restored. It's sealed, it's locked up. So, the inside and outside is taken care of. There's a community group there that takes care of the gardens and you can have, you can have your party there and you could still drink beer there, but you have to clear it with the group and probably have to pay something too.\nWoody: Get a permit?\nDavid: Yeah. Get a permit.\nWoody: But yeah, it's like a neighborhood gathering space now, a community space where you can go and have a party or an event.\nDavid: And the gardens are open to the public all the time. And I'm not sure about the inside of the conservatory, whether that's open every day or not, but it's a really beautiful spot over in the Sunnyside.\nWoody: They did a great restoration, little finial on the top, and the windows, the wood, all the kind of like exposed beams are really neat. So, they did a great job on it. It has a gate to the park.\nWoody: There's a gate to get in, so it's got a little bit more security. But it's really a success story. And it's [00:18:00] really a tribute to the neighbors of the Sunnyside that fought really hard for a long time to get that building and that park fixed up.\nDavid: Absolutely. I'm glad it's there.\nWoody: Yeah, and so if you're in the Sunnyside, if you're driving a Monterey Boulevard, pull over and take a look at the Sunnyside Park there and the Sunnyside Conservatory. It's the second biggest conservatory, I think, in San Francisco. Think so?\nDavid: Don't quote me. Please don't.\nWoody: That could be another correctable error. So, before we sign off, David, I wanna mention that we're going to have a movie night at the Balboa Theater on Tuesday, May 14th, 2013.\nDavid: That's coming up soon.\nWoody: Yeah. So, buy your tickets, $10, and we're gonna show a lot of old news reels, interesting history minutes from our website. Other things of a historical interest.\nDavid: Right. So, if you enjoy the sort of banter that you hear on the Outside Lands podcast, you will probably enjoy this movie night. Because Woody and I will be crackin’ wise all night.\nWoody: Yeah. [00:19:00]\nDavid: From the stage.\nWoody: Yeah. With our friend Katherine Petrin. But we're gonna show a lot of interesting old history stuff too.

{"text":"Tips and Resources for Raising Financially Literate Children\nEarlier is better when it comes to teaching your child about money.\nResearch suggests that lifelong financial habits are formed by the age of seven. Young children learn best through observation and decision-making. Explain spending, saving, and investing as you actively do these things, rather than as concepts. Model good money habits and give your kids opportunities to manage their own money.\nTake Advantage of Teachable Money Management Moments\nWhen you’re shopping with your children, speak aloud about the financial decisions you’re making. Say things like:\n- “I know this cereal has your favorite cartoon character, but the generic brand tastes the same. We can get two of these for the same price as one of those.”\n- “Apples are on sale this week. Let’s buy those instead of strawberries.”\nHelp kids think through money decisions by asking for input.\n- “You already have a raincoat. Why do you think you need another one?”\n- “This raincoat costs the same as the movie ticket. You can have one, but you can’t have both. Would you rather buy the raincoat or see the movie?”\n- “Juice boxes cost more than the big bottle of juice. Should we buy a big bottle, and pour the juice into your go-cup for school lunch?”\nMake Financial Concepts Tangible\nTry the “Three Jar Approach.” Label the jars “saving,” “spending,” and “giving.” Each time your child earns or is gifted money, divide it evenly between the jars. Count the money together when you make a deposit.\nAllow your child to spend the funds in the “spending” jar as they like. Ask your child who they would like to share the “giving” money with. It may be a religious organization, a charity, or a GoFundMe project. Have them choose a bigger-ticket item or experience to purchase with the accumulated money from the “saving” jar.\nConsider Giving Kids an Allowance\nWill your child have to complete chores to earn money? Will they receive a weekly or monthly allowance? In other words, will they need to manage their money over a shorter period or a longer period of time? Will you extend credit, giving your child an advance on their allowance? Will you charge interest?\nInvolve Kids in Family Budgeting\nShow your child your bills. Explain how much you make an hour and how many hours you have to work to pay a particular bill. Talk about ways you can get lower that bill, such as taking showers instead of baths, opening windows instead of running the air conditioner, or turning off lights when you leave a room.\nIf your family is saving for something, such as a vacation or a pontoon boat, tell your child about it. Have a conversation about how much you put towards the goal and how often. Make a savings chart to keep on the refrigerator or family bulletin board.\nOpen a Bank Account with Farm Bureau Bank\nIf your child has $100, they can open an account with Farm Bureau Bank. Banking services are offered online or by phone, so they can manage their own account from the family computer or a smartphone. They can watch their balance change in real time as they deposit funds, use their debit card, or withdraw money from an ATM. Frequent balance checks teach your child to look out for account fraud. Ready to get started?\nMore Money Management Resources\nThe Federal Financial Literacy and Education Commission has a collection of great resources to teach kids of all ages about personal finances.","metadata":{"date":1708596418000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947473738.92\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240222093910-20240222123910-00399.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9531173706,"token_count":771,"url":"https:\/\/floridafarmbureau.com\/2020\/03\/teach-kids-money-management\/"},"score":4,"id":"33"}
{"text":"Core Values & Issues we care about\nUnity, Representation, and Support\nWe're professional collaborators by the nature of our work, plus our collective slate of candidates is inclusive of Democrats and Independents. We are looking to foster greater communication between the township and the school district.\nUnity means that we provide space and opportunity for everyone at USC, regardless of race, gender, ethnicity, religious, political or sexual orientation. We cannot be united if members of our community - new and old - feel unwelcome, underrepresented, or unable to be themselves in our public spaces.\nThe USC community has grown and evolved in its diversity. We are committed not only to welcoming and celebrating this diversity, but also to seeing it as the rich resource that it is to offer great learning opportunities for our children. This election can make this important community leadership position more balanced and ideologically representative of the township as a whole.\nSupport the staff and empower the experts\nWe will continue to attract, hire, and retain the most highly-qualified school staff and teachers. We will respect them and support them as the educated and well-trained professionals that they are. We will empower them to do the good work they were hired to do. That is, to provide the best possible education to all children using evidence-based practices.\nWe’ve each subscribed to this philosophy in the business world and would bring that to the table as school board directors. This stands in stark contrast to many school districts around the country where school boards and\/or constituents are waging sterile culture wars to the detriment of their students. We want to ensure the staff have health and well-being services, and meaningful opportunities for continuing education. This will ensure that we continue to amplify the tradition of educational excellence that has defined USC schools for many years.\nModernize community engagement\nWe strongly believe in the American ideal of Government of, by, and for the people. We believe that engaging with and hearing from our community is critical to the success of our township and school district. We also know that school board and council meetings are not always convenient for many people in our communities due to busy work and family schedules, so their voices aren't heard. This is a problem we can and will fix.\nWe will put our collective decades of experience in technology (media, communication, and instructional technology) to work, deploying common-sense solutions that ensure more access for everyone. We will work to ensure that all township and school board meetings are webcast with the ability for remote attendees to participate during the community feedback portion. We will develop community surveys and parent feedback surveys when necessary on important issues facing our township and school. We will host ongoing webcast Q&A sessions with our leaders along with developing a Community Digital Engagement Strategy for ongoing feedback and communication. We will answer your emails.\nOpen dialogue is critical to keeping our community and schools safe and thriving. We are looking forward to having that dialogue with all of our neighbors.\nInvest in the Future\nTechnology is changing at an extremely rapid pace and revolutionizing our world. The ever-evolving job market and career paths of today and the future means thinking not only about the tools we use to teach our kids but also the tools we teach them to use (e.g., AI and other forms of digital technology) as this will prepare them to find their place in a new professional world where they may take jobs that don’t exist today. If we want to prepare our children to face the challenges of tomorrow and prepare them to adapt to -- and shape -- a rapidly changing world, we need to make sure that we continue to evaluate what we teach our students and make sure we stay abreast of current trends in educational research, scientific knowledge, and the demands of the occupational world. This does not mean an upheaval of the current curriculum, but rather a careful analysis and forecast of what fresh high school graduates will face when they enter the real world.\nIn the age of information, investing in the future also means making sure our children are equipped, through a robust education, with the critical literacy skills necessary to understand the world they live in: information literacy to understand the messages they are exposed to outside of the school context. Financial literacy and budgeting so that they make wise money choices as they enter adulthood. Civic literacy so that they understand the system of government and how they can be full citizens in the world, that is to say people who can participate in the government of, by, and for the people and for greater justice for all. Interpersonal skills so that they are equipped to navigate today’s world, a world that is multicultural and multilingual, and a world where solutions to the complex problems we face will come from people who are trained to work collaboratively and creatively in a mutually respectful and nurturing manner, both locally and beyond.\nIn sum, investing in the future is enabling our children to solve complex problems to compose their own lives and be active “authors of understanding” rather than passive “recipients of information” so that they can truly shape the modern world. This takes time, patience, perseverance, poise, and resources.\nWe will not be a board of “yes-people,” accepting the administration's every recommendation without question, but we will perform true due diligence on each proposal, prevent frivolous spending, and represent the best interests of the community residents who fund the district.\nA high-quality education, like the one that USC students receive, takes enormous resources.

{"text":"Historians and theologians have long recognized that at the heart of the sixteenth-century Protestant Reformation were five declarations, often referred to as the ‘solas’: sola scriptura, solus Christus, sola gratia, sola fide, and soli Deo gloria. These five statements summarize much of what the Reformation was about, and they distinguish Protestantism from other expressions of the Christian faith. Protestants place ultimate and final authority in the Scriptures, acknowledge the work of Christ alone as sufficient for redemption, recognize that salvation is by grace alone through faith alone, and seek to do all things for God’s glory. In God’s Glory Alone—The Majestic Heart of Christian Faith and Life, renowned scholar David VanDrunen looks at the historical and biblical roots of the idea that all glory belongs to God alone. He examines the development of this theme in the Reformation, in subsequent Reformed theology and confessions, and in contemporary theologians who continue to be inspired by the conviction that all glory belongs to God. Then he turns to the biblical story of God's glory, beginning with the pillar of cloud and fire revealed to Israel, continuing through the incarnation, death, and exaltation of the Lord Jesus Christ, and culminating in Christ's Second Coming and the glorification of his people. In light of these wonderful biblical themes he concludes by addressing several of today's great cultural challenges and temptations—such as distraction and narcissism—and reflecting on how commitment to God's glory alone fortifies us to live godly lives in this present evil age.\n“Anyone who wishes to know the great God of glory must see him through the humility of the cross.” (Page 16)\n“The Reformers may not have spoken explicitly of ‘the five solas,’ but the magnification of Christ, grace, faith, Scripture, and God’s glory—and these alone—suffused their theology and ethics, their worship and piety. Christ alone, and no other redeemer, is the mediator of our salvation. Grace alone, and not any human contribution, saves us. Faith alone, and no other human action, is the instrument by which we’re saved. Scripture, and no merely human word, is our ultimate standard of authority. God’s glory alone, and that of no creature, is the supreme end of all things.” (Page 14)\n“‘the glory of God is the weight of the majestic goodness of who God is, and the resulting name, or reputation, that he gains from his revelation of himself as Creator, Sustainer, Judge, and Redeemer, perfect in justice and mercy, loving-kindness and truth.’” (Page 23)\n“The alleged problem is this: the emphasis on God’s glory and God’s glory alone seems to demean human beings. If God’s glory implies humanity’s debasement, is such a God really worthy of our praise?” (Page 18)\n“‘Glory to God’ was the theme of the angelic host that announced Jesus’ birth to the shepherds in the field and of the heavenly throng whose songs John recorded in Revelation.” (Page 13)","metadata":{"date":1708636197000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947473824.45\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240222193722-20240222223722-00699.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9382609725,"token_count":689,"url":"https:\/\/www.logos.com\/product\/189275\/gods-glory-alone-the-majestic-heart-of-christian-faith-and-life"},"score":3,"id":"36"}

{"text":"Check out 20 amazing cannabis facts you won’t believe are real.\nWant some fun facts? We do, too! We rounded up a couple of interesting cannabis facts so you can expand your knowledge on this wonderful plant. You might think you know a lot about marijuana, but chances are you don’t know everything. Here are 20 things you didn’t know about cannabis.\n20 Interesting Cannabis Facts\n1. Cannabis Goes Back At Least 12,000 Years\nThis means that cannabis is one of mankind’s oldest crops, according to the book Marihuana: The First Twelve Thousand Years by E. L. Abel.\n2. Weed Was The First Online Sale\nOf course, it was illegal back then. In the early 1970s, Stanford students bought a bag of weed from MIT students. This means that the first product ever sold online was cannabis!\n3. You Can Eat Cannabis Raw\nGranted, it tastes a lot better when prepared with yummy edibles like brownies, bread, or cake. But cannabis can be consumed raw. One more thing is that if you eat it raw, it won’t get you high, but it will provide you with all the medicinal benefits.\n4. Modern-Day Cannabis Is A Lot Stronger\nWe talked about this on the cannabis flower and its influence in the 60s. For one, it’s purer than the illegal “hippie weed” that was imported into the United States. And it’s also been cultivated to increase its THC content, so the high you get from marijuana today is a lot stronger than what your parents or grandparents consumed.\n5. Not All Weed Gets You High\nYou read that right. THC is not the same as CBD, which means that the type you choose to consume will have different effects on your body. One will provide all the relaxing and medicinal benefits, while the other will provide the psychoactive effects of the high.\n6. Cannabis Has Tons Of Nicknames\nDue to its illegal status, cannabis is one of the drugs with the most nicknames out there. Weed, ganja, pot, grass, dope, reefer, hash, and even sandwiches if you’re a How I Met Your Mother fan are just a few of the slang terms that have become a part of the beloved cannabis culture.\n7. Shakespeare Smoked Cannabis\nMaybe his source of inspiration? Marijuana residues were found in William Shakespeare’s home, which we believe could have been an enormous aid in writing all the screenplays and poems.\n8. Bob Marley Was Buried With Grass\nThe musical star was buried with his red Gibson guitar, a cannabis bud, and a Bible open on the 23rd Psalm, which reads: “The Lord is my shepherd, I lack nothing. He makes me lie down in green pastures”. Way to go, Marley.\n9. Cannabis Can Both Relax & Invigorate You\nThis mainly depends on the type of strain you use to consume. Indica is more relaxing and sedating, while Sativa is more uplifting and energetic. You can choose either or a mix or both for interesting results!\n10. You Can’t Lethally Overdose On Cannabis\nDon’t get us wrong. You can overdose on cannabis, which means consuming more than the recommended amount. What it means is that it’s practically impossible for you to consume the amount of cannabis it would take to kill a person.\n11. Cannabis Has Over 100 Active Cannabinoids\nIn fact, over 120. The most famous ones are (you guessed it!) THC and CBD.\n12. LA Is Weed Wonderland\nLos Angeles, aside from being the city of stars, has more marijuana dispensaries than Starbucks. Welcome to LaLa Land.\n13. California Banned First\nA century ago, California was the first state in the United States to ban cannabis. This is a bit ironic when we look at the fun fact above. But it looks like Cali learned its lesson!\n14. Cannabis Can Be Used In Construction\nAnd clothing. And plastic. And the best part is that all of these options are eco-friendly. Learn more about hemp and its benefits here.\n15. Cannabis Can Improve Senior Life Quality\nFrom providing relaxation to becoming a more natural approach to pain relief treatments, cannabis is definitely here to improve the life quality of our senior citizens.\n16. Cannabis Has Medicinal Benefits\nIncluding being a natural analgesic.\n17. Weed Is Beer’s Cousin!\nBeer hops are in the same family of flowering plants as cannabis. We thought the plants looked similar… and now we know why.\n18. Uruguay Was The Future\nIn 2013, Uruguay became the first country in the world to legalize growing, selling, and consuming cannabis.\n19. USA Grows The Most\nAccording to Civilized Life, the United States is the top marijuana-producing nation in the entire world. Behind it are Morocco, Afghanistan, Mexico, and Colombia. Who would have thought?\n20. George Washington Grew Cannabis\nThat’s right. The first president of the United States of America grew hemp. His farms at Mount Vernon were used to grow hemp in order to make paper, rope, sail canvas, clothing, and fishing nets.\nSo there you have it! 20 very interesting and fun cannabis facts you probably didn’t know. If you would like to know more about CBD and cannabis use in general, then one of our certificate programs & courses may suit your curious mind.

{"text":"The failure of countrywide basic literacy campaigns to enhance social mobility has led to the promotion and development of localized, comprehensive functional literacy campaigns. These campaigns are particularly applicable to marginalized groups; as they aim to empower communities by providing them with the necessary skills to navigate their socioeconomic and political environments. This qualitative study examines the long-term impact of one such functional literacy campaign on the semi-nomadic pastoral Van Gujjar community. I use the Assets, Opportunity Structure, and Degrees of Empowerment (DOE) method to investigate community members’ perceptions of the level of political empowerment that followed their participation in a functional literacy program. Participatory Rural Appraisal(PRA) techniques such as focus groups(n3), semi-structured interview (n30), observation, and key informant interviews(n3) provide a comprehensive understanding of the perceived link between functional literacy and political empowerment in the Van Gujjar community.

{"text":"Latte purists, before you roll your eyes at the golden milk latte trend, know this is not just another coffee fad lurking in the glittery shadow of the unicorn-frap!\nFact: Turmeric has a long history of healing and has been consumed in hot-drink form in India for centuries. I learned this from Deepi Harish’s article, Turmeric Was India’s Cure-All Long Before Hipsters Made It a Latte. Turmeric “lattes” were something her mom, who grew up in the village of Punjab, called haldi doodh, which translates to turmeric milk.\nHarish writes, “Turmeric is often prescribed by Ayurvedic practitioners to support the blood, liver, joints, immune system and digestive tract. In India, about 80 per cent of the rural population depends on traditional Ayurvedic medicine.” So, making drinks out of it was a simple way to reap the health benefits–and it’s not surprising that, after ghee, coconut oil and chai, turmeric would find its place in the Western wellness world.\nWill your local indie coffee dealer (see a few of them below) be able to serve you a drink that heals what ails you? Maybe not like the haldi doodh in India, but consuming more turmeric, latte or not, could definitely help you feel more vital. According to Ayurveda, turmeric balances the three doshas; vata, pitta, and kapha (the energies that circulate throughout the body and govern our activity).\nHolistic healing homeboy and Indian native Deepak Chopra refers to turmeric as a pharmacy unto itself. It is naturally anti-inflammatory and antioxidant, which supports our physical health in a host of ways. So let the golden milk trend grow and evolve. But if you want to start with the latte, peep this recipe from Toronto dealer Nutbar’s kitchen:\n1 cup milk (or milk alternative of your choosing)\n3\/4 tsp turmeric\n1\/4 tsp cinnamon\n1 tbsp raw honey\n1\/2 tsp vanilla\na pinch of black pepper\nCombine all ingredients except milk, add a few tablespoons of hot water to mixture and stir to make a paste. Pour the mixture through a strainer into a cup, steam milk until frothy (optional), and pour over your turmeric mixture.

{"text":"Canning Foods At High Altitude\nIf you live at altitudes higher than 1000 feet above the sea, canning foods must be a whole different ball game for you. Making jams and preserves, veggies and tomato soups, or anything else is a unique experience when living so far above the surface of the sea.\nWe are here to help you figure out why that’s the case and how you can make up for the higher elevation.\nHigh Altitude Canning – What’s Different?\nThe boiling point of water changes due to lower atmospheric pressure and lower boiling temperature at higher altitudes. This affects your canning abilities because the boiling water bath method depends on the temperature and the food’s high acidity to safely preserve it.\nUp until 1000 feet above sea level, the boiling temperature for water is at 212 °F. But it changes to 207.1 °F at 2500 feet.\nIn water bath canning, ensuring these temperature levels maintains food safety; making up for the difference is essential. If the boiling water isn’t hot enough, the foods won’t be effectively sterilized.\nPressure canning also requires temperatures higher than that of boiling water to preserve low-acid foods safely. Also, expect the light atmospheric pressure at high altitudes to affect pressure canning, which means you need to increase pressure accordingly.\nHigh-Altitude Canning Adjustments\nThere are two types of canning that you need to take care of when making adjustments to the recipes at high altitudes:\n- At high altitudes, add processing time for boiling water bath canning\n- At high altitudes, raise the pressure for pressure canning\nBoiling Water Bath\nThe altitude you are on and the recipe’s processing time determine the adjustments you have to make with the boiling water bath canning.\nFor a recipe with a processing time of over 20 minutes:\n- 1,001–3,000 feet above sea level: raise time by 5 minutes\n- 3,001–6,000 feet above sea level: raise time by 10 minutes\n- 6,001–8,000 feet: raise time by 15 minutes\n- 8,001–10,000 feet: increase time by 20 minutes\nFor a recipe with a processing time of under 20 minutes:\n- 1,001–6,000 feet above sea level: raise time by 5 minutes\n- Over 6,000 feet: increase time by 10 minutes\nIn the case of pressure canning recipes, you will usually find a processing pressure of 10 pounds-per-square-inch gauge (PSIG) compared to the surrounding environment. This pressure is essential to produce a 240 degrees F boiling temperature at sea level.\nA deadweight gauge pressure canner raises the pressure to 15 PSIG at over 1000 feet sea level.\nUse the following pressure increments for dial gauge pressure canners.\n- 1,001–3,000 feet: raise pressure by 2 PSIG\n- 3,001–5,000 feet: increase pressure by 3 PSIG\n- 5,001–7,000 feet: increase pressure by 4 PSIG\n- Above 7,000 feet: increase pressure by 5 PSIG\nSome Tips For High Altitude Canning\nTo save your time while canning at high altitudes, follow our tips:\n- At high altitudes, jellies reach the gelling stage faster, and the candy thermometer does not help get an accurate reading. Remember that a gel point at sea level is different than that above 1000 feet and gives a pasta-like consistency instead.\n- At high altitudes, canning sessions take longer because of the higher boiling point of water. So keep in mind that both types of canning take a longer time to get ready than you anticipate.\nIf you live on high altitudes and want to enjoy delicious canned foods, don’t be bummed about the recipe’s requirements.\nFollow our guide to safely use the food by making some easy adjustments to the recipes.

{"text":"The Cubical Lattice Concept\nOne of the first things that had to be determined was how best to place the uranium in the reactor. Fermi and Szilard suggested placing the uranium in a matrix of the moderating material, thus forming a cubical lattice of uranium. This placement appeared to offer the best opportunity for a neutron to encounter a uranium atom. Of all the materials which possessed the proper moderating qualities, graphite was the only one which could be obtained in sufficient quantity of the desired degree of purity.\nThe study of graphite-uranium lattice reactors was started at Columbia in July, 1941, but after reorganization of the uranium project in December, 1941, Arthur H. Compton was placed in charge of this phase of the work, under the Office of Scientific Research and Development, and it was decided that the chain reactor program should be concentrated at the University of Chicago. Consequently, early in 1942 the Columbia and Princeton groups were transferred to Chicago where the Metallurgical Laboratory was established.\nIn a general way, the experimental nuclear physics group under Fermi was primarily concerned with getting a chain reaction going; the chemistry division organized by F. H. Spedding (later in turn under S. K. Allison, J. Franck, W. C. Johnson, and T. Hogness) with the chemistry of plutonium and with separation methods, and the theoretical group under E. P. Wigner with designing production piles. However, the problems were intertwined and the various scientific and technical aspects of the fission process were studied in whatever group seemed best equipped for the particular task.\nAt Chicago, the work on subcritical size piles was continued. By July, 1942, the measurements obtained from these experimental piles had gone far enough to permit a choice of design for a test pile of critical size. At that time, the dies for the pressing of the uranium oxides were designed by Zinn and ordered made. It was a fateful step, since the entire construction of the pile depended upon the shape and size of the uranium pieces.\nIt was necessary to use uranium oxides because metallic uranium of the desired degree of purity did not exist. Although several manufacturers were attempting to produce the uranium metal, it was not until November that any appreciable amount was available. By mid-November, Westinghouse Electric and Manufacturing Company, Metal Hydrides Company, and F. H. Spedding, who was working at Iowa State College at Ames, Iowa, had delivered several tons of the highly purified metal which was placed in the pile, as close to the center as possible. The procurement program for moderating material and uranium oxides had been handled by Norman Hilberry. R. L. Doan headed the procurement program for pure uranium metal.\nAlthough the dies for the pressing of the uranium oxides were designed in July, additional measurements were necessary to obtain information about controlling the reaction, to revise estimates as to the final critical size of the pile, and to develop other data. Thirty experimental subcritical piles were constructed before the final pile was completed.","metadata":{"date":1709001516000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947474670.19\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240227021813-20240227051813-00799.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9714081287,"token_count":626,"url":"https:\/\/www.atomicarchive.com\/history\/first-pile\/firstpile_04.html"},"score":4,"id":"46"}
{"text":"Black Friday – a story that starts with a crash, continues with discontent and ends in excitement\nIt is one of the characterizing events of a digital era. These days, it involves people from all around the world in a consumerist pursuit of happiness. But what’s the complete story of Black Friday?\n2019, 29th of November, Black Friday. One of the largest shopping events in the world, with a worldwide coverage in the last decade. Busy shoppers, busy stores, complex marketing campaigns elaborated within the offices of large enterprises and businesses across six continents. Consumerism and technology seem to be good friends, since technology facilitates globalization and globalization flattens the demand by universalizing trends, products, services and, ultimately, people.\n1869, 24th of September, Black Friday. In an attempt to speculate in the gold price, two Wall Street investors recklessly determined a crash on the stock market. Even if, in the end, they didn’t suffer any punishment or economic loss, the crash affected the US economy for the next following years, leaving many people bankrupt. Subsequently, the public opinion started to refer to this date as the “Black Friday”.\nHowever, the term has a positive connotation nowadays, so you will probably wonder how that happened and also how Black Friday became associated with shopping? Well, it all started with a correlation between the shopping season and the holiday season. The official debut? The day after Thanksgiving, or the last Friday in November.\nAt the turn of the twentieth century, the day after Thanksgiving was marked as the starting point of the holiday shopping season, with thematic parades and Santa Clauses metaphorically announcing that shops, companies or retailers can finally start advertising their businesses. But hold on for a little longer, we’re not there yet.\nAs revenue, hence profit, is one of the fundamental aspects of most businesses, a shorter holiday shopping season can seriously affect the market. It happened in 1939, when Thanksgiving fell during the fifth week of November, which would’ve shortened the season. The matter reached Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s ears, so he postponed Thanksgiving by one week. The immediate reaction of the public opinion was negative, as the change interfered with everyone’s holiday plans. However, two years later, Thanksgiving was settled by law on the fourth Thursday of November.\nWith a fixed date now in mind, everyone knew what to expect for and how to prepare, every year. But society was constantly expanding, information was spreading faster and cities were becoming more and more crowded. In post-war times of peace and prosperity, economy was growing and people were eager to spend.\nTherefore, during the sixties, the day after Thanksgiving started to cause more problems in terms of order and smoothness. Handling traffic jams, crowded streets and enthusiast groups of people required more law enforcement was logically required. That’s why police officers were not so happy about the scale and proportion of these events. For some of these policemen, especially for those in Philadelphia, this day got the name of “Black Friday”. Eventually, as every publicity is good publicity, the media saw the opportunity and turned the connotation of this name into a positive one, over the following decades. Today, we all know how it is. What’s more to it is that many retailers extended the Black Friday period, so now it can start before or end after the fourth Friday of November.\n2019, 29th of November, Black Friday. Almost hypnotised by discounts and advertisement campaigns, people feel the effects of an age of consumerism, as they comply to an urge to buy everything – from electronic gadgets (smartphones, laptops, gaming consoles) to washing machines, microwaves and in some places even frying pans or chainsaws. All of this in a sort of pursuit of happiness, which takes place both online and offline. Apparently, at the end of the day, everyone is happy: people feel like they’ve fulfilled a goal with their new products and companies are satisfied with their successful campaigns, growing profits and thicker wallets. This is how the holiday shopping season starts.\nSubscribe to the Blog\nJoin for the latest tech, design and industry news straight to your inbox.\nOur UX team designs customer experiences and digital products that your users will love.","metadata":{"date":1708627113000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947473824.13\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240222161802-20240222191802-00598.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9670284986,"token_count":885,"url":"https:\/\/www.uxconnections.com\/black-friday-a-story-that-starts-with-a-crash-continues-with-discontent-and-ends-in-excitement\/"},"score":3,"id":"47"}
{"text":"Picture it—you design an exciting, collaborative lesson that that you’re sure your students are going to love. The best part about it? They get to work together in groups! Everything is going amazingly until:\n- One group has that slacker who’s not doing their fair share.\n- Another group has that student does all of the work while the others look on.\n- And in the end, one group’s project turns out awful, and the group turns on each other.\nWhile working cooperatively with others is an important life skill, it can definitely be tricky when it involves kids whose abilities (and attitudes) vary wildly. Middle school teacher Sara recently wrote into our WeAreTeachers HELPLINE! with a group work dilemma involving one student who was bulldozing the other members of the group. Not only that, but when she was recently absent the group had no access to the project’s materials and no idea how to proceed without her. Here are some words of wisdom our teachers offered to conduct successful group work in the classroom.\nTop 📸 credit from Beyond Traditional Math—check out their site for additional tips for group work!\n1. Assign roles.\n“Assign each student in the group a unique role so that everyone has to work together to make the project a success,” said Jaime L. Being solely responsible for a portion of the work gives students ownership over the project’s success. The nature of the project will dictate the roles, but some examples are: proofreader, fact-checker, and scribe.\n2. Make sure every group member has access.\nTechnology makes it easy for each group member to have access to all work and collaborate. “I have each member share any and all work on Google drive,” advised Sonja L. This helps facilitate the notion of working together and contributing equally.\nIf your students don’t have daily access to technology, make sure they have a system to store hard copies of their group work in the classroom. “When I do group work, I have a work-in-progress folder for each class. That way, they always have the work even if someone is absent.” —Karen K.\n3. Ask for input.\nBecky M. shares, “At the end of a project, I have each student write a reflection. What was easy about the project? What was challenging? What grade would you give each person in your group, and why?” Let students know the contents of their letter will remain confidential but will also factor into their final grade. Listening to your students can help give you insider information about who really worked and who didn’t. It can also help you structure your project differently next time, if necessary.\n4. And grade accordingly.\nInclude a participation grade into your rubric and make a point of observing each group’s activity during class. When students know that their grade is dependent on their participation, they are more likely to work toward the project’s success. “If I see that only one member is doing most of the work, I absolutely adjust grades to incorporate that information,” says Sonja L..\n5. Speak to outliers privately.\nSlackers are easy to redirect, but students who can’t help themselves from taking over have their own set of issues that need addressing too. “Sometimes high-achieving students are afraid of letting others do any work for fear it won’t be good enough,” says Mark J., “and so they control all of the work, which leads to them doing everything.” If that’s the case, talk with the student about the importance of collaboration and letting go.\nWhat do you do to ensure successful group work in the classroom? Come share in our WeAreTeachers HELPLINE group on Facebook!\nAlso, check out 5 #teachertruths about group projects.","metadata":{"date":1709543779000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947476432.11\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240304065639-20240304095639-00298.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9656848907,"token_count":829,"url":"https:\/\/www.weareteachers.com\/group-work-in-the-classroom\/"},"score":3,"id":"48"}

{"text":"A Chinese Long March 2D rocket lifts off with the Shiyan 13 satellite. Credit: CASC\nChina launched a Long March 2D rocket Monday with another classified satellite, deploying the spacecraft into a polar orbit on the first of more than 40 Chinese Long March rocket missions planned in 2022.\nThe Long March 2D rocket took off from the Taiyuan launch base in Shanxi province of northern China at 0435 GMT Sunday (11:35 p.m. EST Sunday), according to the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corp. or CASC.\nLiftoff occurred at 10:35 a.m. Beijing time Monday.\nCASC, China’s largest state-owned space industry contractor, said the Long March 2D rocket delivered the Shiyan 13 satellite into orbit. Chinese officials did not disclose details about the purpose of the mission, other than claiming Shiyan 13 will be used for space environment data collection and technology tests.\nChina’s series of Shiyan satellites, which began launching in 2004, have been used for technology demonstrations and experiments. Many of the Shiyan missions to date have likely had a military purpose.\nThe 134-foot-tall (41-meter) Long March 2D rocket that carried Shiyan 13 into orbit lifted off with more than 650,000 pounds of thrust from its hydrazine-fueled first stage engines. Heading south from Taiyuan over Chinese territory, the two-stage launcher climbed through the atmosphere accelerated to a speed of nearly 5 miles (8 kilometers) per second.\nThe U.S. military, which publishes orbital data online, said it tracked the Shiyan 13 satellite in an orbit between 287 miles and 309 miles (463 by 498 kilometers) at an inclination of 97.4 degrees to the equator.\nChinese officials declared the launch a success, and the U.S. military tracking data confirmed the mission reached orbit.\nCASC said in a statement that the launch was the first of more than 40 missions the organization plans to perform this year. CASC builds and oversees the Long March rocket family, China’s most-flown launch vehicle.\nMore than 15 of the launches will use the Long March 2D rocket configuration, according to CASC. The Long March 2D is designed to carry payloads weighing up to 2,900 pounds (about 1.3 metric tons) into a polar sun-synchronous orbit.\nAccomplishing 15 or more Long March 2D launches this year would set an annual record for this type of rocket.\nOther major Chinese space missions scheduled for launch in 2022 include six Long March rocket flights to build and outfit China’s space station.\nThe station’s Tianhe core module launched last April on a heavy-lift Long March 5B rocket. China launched a Long March 7 rocket with a Tianzhou cargo ship in May to dock with the Tianhe module, delivering supplies for first three astronauts who launched to the station in June.\nThat crew returned to Earth in September, the same month China launched another Tianzhou cargo mission.\nThree more astronauts on China’s Shenzhou 13 spacecraft launched and docked with the station’s Tianhe core module in October to begin a six-month stay, the longest China human spaceflight mission to date.\nThis year, China aims to launch two more large space station modules — each weighing more than 20 tons at launch — on Long March 5B rockets from the Wenchang space center on Hainan Island. The Wentian and Mengtian pressurized modules will adding living space and scientific laboratory capabilities to the Chinese space station.\nTwo Tianzhou cargo freighters on Long March 7 rockets and two Shenzhou crew ferry ships on Long March 2F rockets are also scheduled to launch to the Chinese space station this year.\nEmail the author.\nFollow Stephen Clark on Twitter: @StephenClark1.\nRead More – Spaceflight Now","metadata":{"date":1708717092000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947474445.77\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240223185223-20240223215223-00398.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9300768375,"token_count":806,"url":"https:\/\/spacereporting.com\/first-chinese-space-mission-of-2022-rockets-into-orbit\/"},"score":3,"id":"50"}

{"text":"Are you confused about how many ounces are in 1.2 liters? If you’re from a country that primarily uses the metric system, you might find it challenging to convert the volume measurements into imperial units. In this guide, we’ll discuss everything you need to know about converting liters to ounces and vice versa.\nThis guide will be helpful if you’re cooking something or working with ingredients that require a certain amount of liquid. By the end of this article, you’ll be able to convert liters to ounces effortlessly. Let’s get started!\nWhat is a liter, and what is an ounce?\nBefore diving into conversions, let’s define what a liter and an ounce mean. A liter is a unit of volume in the metric system, and it’s equal to 1000 milliliters. An ounce, on the other hand, is a unit of volume in the imperial system, and it’s equal to 28.35 milliliters or 1\/128th of a U.S. gallon.\nHow Many Ounces in 1.2 Liters?\nTo convert liters to ounces, you’ll need to know that one liter is equal to 33.814 ounces. Therefore, to calculate how many ounces are in 1.2 liters, you’ll need to multiply 1.2 by 33.814. The answer, in this case, is 40.5768 ounces.\nHow Many Ounces Are in 1\/2 Liter?\nTo convert 1\/2 liter to ounces, you’ll need to multiply 0.5 by 33.814. The result is 16.907 ounces.\nHow Many Ounces in 1 Liter?\nIf you want to know how many ounces are in one liter, you don’t have to do any calculations because we know that one liter equals 33.814 ounces. So, if you have one liter of liquid, it’s the same as having 33.814 ounces.\nHow Many Liters in 1 Ounce?\nTo convert ounces to liters, you’ll need to divide the number of ounces by 33.814. For example, if you have 16 ounces of liquid and want to know how many liters that is, you’ll need to divide 16 by 33.814. The answer is 0.473 liters.\nHow to Measure Liquid in Ounces and Liters\nIn cooking, measuring the right amount of liquid is crucial to ensure the recipe’s success. You can measure liquid in both ounces and liters, depending on the recipe’s requirements. Measuring cups and spoons are widely used to measure liquid in ounces, while measuring jugs or cups are used for liters. Here are some tips for measuring liquid:\nMeasuring Liquid in Ounces\n- Fill the measuring cup to the desired amount, holding the cup at eye level to ensure accuracy.\n- Avoid shaking the cup to level the liquid as it can introduce more air into the mixture.\nMeasuring Liquid in Liters\n- Place the measuring jug or cup on a flat surface and make sure it’s stable.\n- Pour the liquid slowly to the desired amount, making sure it’s level with the markings on the jug or cup.\nConversion Table for Liters to Ounces\nTo make the conversion process easier, we’ve created a table with some common conversions of liters to ounces. You can refer to this table whenever you need to make a quick conversion.\nWhy is it important to measure accurately?\nCooking is a science, and the success of the recipe depends on accurate measurement. If you add too much or too little liquid to a recipe, it can affect the texture, flavor, and consistency. For instance, if you add too much liquid to a cake recipe, it might turn out dense and chewy. On the other hand, if you add too little liquid, the cake might be dry and crumbly. Therefore, it’s essential to measure accurately to ensure the recipe’s success.\nIn conclusion, converting liters to ounces is simple if you know the conversion rate. One liter is equal to 33.814 ounces, and you can use this conversion rate to make any necessary calculations. It’s essential to measure liquid accurately in cooking to ensure the recipe’s success. Now that you’ve learned how to convert liters to ounces, you can use this knowledge in your cooking and baking endeavors!\nFrequently Asked Questions\n- How many ounces are in 1.2 liters?

{"text":"NASA’s Hubble Telescope has captured an image of the lenticular galaxy NGC 3489, 30 million light-years away. This galaxy, exhibiting traits of both spiral and elliptical galaxies, houses a Seyfert type active galactic nucleus, allowing its surrounding galaxy to remain visible despite the black hole’s radiation emissions.\nThis image of the lenticular galaxy NGC 3489 was captured by the Hubble Space Telescope. Lenticular galaxies aren’t quite spiral galaxies or elliptical galaxies. They lie somewhere in between, exhibiting traits of both. Lenticular galaxies have a central bulge of tightly packed stars and a thin, circular disk of stars, gas, and dust, like spiral galaxies, but they lack arms. And like elliptical galaxies, lenticular galaxies have older stellar populations and little ongoing star formation.\nNGC 3489 has an active galactic nucleus, or AGN. The AGN sits at the center of the galaxy, is extremely bright, and emits radiation across the entire electromagnetic spectrum as the black hole devours material that gets too close to it.\nThis lenticular galaxy is a Seyfert galaxy, which is a class of AGN that is dimmer than other types of AGNs. They generally don’t outshine the rest of the galaxy, so the galaxy surrounding the black hole is clearly visible. Other types of AGNs emit so much radiation that it is almost impossible to observe the host galaxy.\nNGC 3489 is about 30 million light-years away in the constellation Leo.","metadata":{"date":1709557034000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947476442.30\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240304101406-20240304131406-00399.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9017857313,"token_count":314,"url":"https:\/\/scitechdaily.com\/hubbles-stunning-glimpse-into-a-rare-galactic-hybrid\/"},"score":4,"id":"56"}
{"text":"What is it about miniature representations that make our hearts explode with happiness? It might be the amount of work and patience that goes into each piece, or it might be the sheer size of it. Whatever it is, we’re always delighted to run into miniature artists.\nMost recently, we’ve come across Dina Brodsky’s miniature paintings. As it turns out, painting small comes naturally to Brodsky. “When I paint small I’m like a fish in water,” she shared with Whitehot Magazine. “I am much less comfortable painting on a larger scale, and very few of my large works hold up as well as the miniatures.”\nHer miniatures include representations of natural landscapes, animals, and architecture. There’s also a series dedicated to seemingly empty rooms, finely painted—a sort of peephole, presenting snapshots of everyday life.\nAccording to Brodsky, her painting technique relies on a combination of classical oil painting techniques (15th century Northern Renaissance methods and 17th-century Venetian techniques) alongside contemporary materials such as mylar and plexiglass.\n“When I was studying, the things I had trouble with had more to do with drawing, proportion, perspective, anatomy, architecture,” she notes. “I feel like I am still catching up and trying to master a lot of those things. But color has always come organically.”\nBorn in Minsk, Belarus, Brodsky moved to the US in 1991 where she studied at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, before earning her MFA at the New York Academy of Art. These days, she also runs online seminars, teaching others how to build an engaged community online, so as to enhance their online presence.","metadata":{"date":1708515591000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947473472.21\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240221102433-20240221132433-00698.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9623650312,"token_count":373,"url":"https:\/\/5dwallpaper.com\/the-tiny-incredible-worlds-of-dina-brodsky\/"},"score":2,"id":"57"}
{"text":"My shopping cart\nYour cart is currently empty.Continue Shopping\nAs much as one may plan, there are certain things one can only prepare for. Truthfully speaking, one can only demand things from businesses, not people. Bride and Grooms usually encounter difficult wedding guests on what should be their special day, an invitation that should be taken as an honor. Unfortunately, some guests do not understand the value of attending a wedding. Here is our list of the worst wedding guest types.\nThere’s a reason why wedding invitations are a huge industry: bride and grooms carefully plan who they want attending their wedding. Unfortunately, not everyone who is invited RSVPs, or those who do attend may bring more attendees than allowed. In both instances, it can cause a few issues.\nOne of the main benefits of using wedding invitations is to determine how many people will attend your wedding. You ask possible attendees to RSVP in advance in order to estimate how many wedding guests you will have, where to seat them, and whether some guests will not attend. If someone isn’t attending but you have another guest who may want to bring one or two more guests, the bride and groom can decide to allow the extra guests since another guest declined.\nHaving an accurate number of wedding guests is crucial since your venue most likely has a limit on guests as well as an average cost per guest. Out of 100 sent out invitations, roughly 60 people RSVP. On the day of your wedding, you may be surprised to find out that there are almost 150 people in the room! Some guests may have missed the number of allowed guests on their invitation and figure they could bring a family member or two. Especially applicable for guests with children, parents with newborns will most likely attend as a family while young children could potentially be guests at your wedding if the parents could not find a babysitter. You may run into issues such as running out of chairs, tables, and food. It could also hurt you financially since you already set your budget to a maximum of 100 people (for example).\nWedding etiquette is extremely important though an unwritten rule. Some guests feel they are attending a party instead of an intimate gathering. They party as if they are in the night club and do not respect the solemnity of the event. Some enjoy the free alcohol and may act inappropriately with your venue staff or guests.\nFor some insensitive relatives, your wedding day is treated as their moment to vent familial grudges. Some may even have the courage of making a scene in your wedding! Ask your closest relatives for whom they feel should be invited. Try to include characters you feel will enjoy your beautiful ceremony and participate in accordingly. Be prepared to exclude certain people from you wedding day even if you are faced with opposition.\nUnfortunately, your bridesmaids can also bring about stress; they may complain about unflattering cut off their dresses, the color and fabric of their gown not matching their skin tone, or how they don’t approve your future husband. The lesson here is whenever picking your bridesmaids, make sure that you know them for a long time. They should be taking care of you during that day and not the other way around.\nSo how to handle these shenanigans? First and foremost, try to inhale and exhale in order to clear your mind. Remember to deal with those unexpected situations with grace and poise. Make sure you have someone to go to when things become too stressful, someone who will listen and calmly help you solve any issues.

{"text":"Are you looking for a free business email you can rely on?\nA business email is one of the best ways to help build trust for your company. It can quickly show people that you are serious about your business. Since your company name will be part of the professional business email address, it can help build your brand further.\nTo add to this, business emails often have better security protocols and come with additional tools to help you manage your emails better.\nIn this article, we will show you 2 of the best ways to get a free custom business email and how to set it up in less than five minutes.\nBut first, let us look at what a business email is.\nWhat is a Business Email?\nA business email uses your own domain name instead of an email service provider like Gmail or Yahoo.com. For example, a business email would be structured like ‘[email protected]’ for individual email addresses.\nHowever, you can also structure business emails in different ways.\n- Departments: [email protected]\n- Position: [email protected]\n- Function: [email protected]\n- Product: [email protected]\n- Location: [email protected]\n- Role: [email protected]\nYour email client will know exactly who they are talking to from the business email, further building your reputation and trust and, in the long run, improving your SEO and brand.\nBefore we look at how to get a free business email, it is important to understand what to look for when picking the right business email provider.\n- User-friendly interface: Ensure the email service provides an easy-to-use interface for smooth communication and efficient use.\n- Cost of upgrades: Check the pricing structure and potential expenses for upgrading your business email service. Consider features like increased storage, cloud storage, or addons.\n- Additional tools: Look for features such as calendars and task management. Also, check for collaboration tools to help with productivity within the email platform.\n- Backups and restoration: Confirm that the service includes dependable backup and restoration options to safeguard important data in case of accidents or system failures.\n- Support: Check the quality and availability of customer support, ensuring timely assistance for any technical issues or other problems that may arise.\n- Integration: Check for integration with other business tools and software your team uses to help with workflow.\n- Mobile use: Ensure the email platform offers reliable and user-friendly mobile apps, allowing team members to stay connected and productive on the go.\n- Storage space: Check the available storage space and whether it meets your business’s current needs. Also, check if the storage is enough for future growth without incurring excessive costs.\n- Uptime: Verify the email service’s uptime guarantee to minimize disruptions, ensuring your team can access their emails without downtime.\n- Ad-free: Go for an ad-free business email service to maintain a professional appearance and eliminate distractions that may be associated with free email providers.\nWith that said, the 2 options we have provided below meet all the requirements mentioned above. Now, let’s jump into learning how to get a free business address.\nHow to Get a Free Business Email Address\nWith most popular web hosting providers, a business email comes completely free with the hosting plan you get. However, even though the business email is free, you still need to pay for hosting.\nOn the other hand, Google Workspace is a great option if you are just starting out. You do not need a website to host your business email, but you need a domain name, which comes at a cost.\nGoogle Workspace is also not free; it starts at $6 a month. But since you do not need a website hosting service, like in the case of Bluehost, it balances out in the end.\nBut as an added bonus, you can work with both Bluehost and Google Workspace to meet your emailing needs. This relationship ensures you enjoy the best features of both of these business powerhouses.\nFor example, you can access all your favorite Google apps from an easy-to-use Bluehost control panel. This means you can store or back up all your emails and content on the Google Cloud drive offered through this partnership.\nYou can also schedule blog posts, newsletters, and so on with Google Calendar. At the same time, enjoy the speeds, uptime, and security that come with Bluehost emailing and hosting. As a result, working with Bluehost and Google Workspace can help improve team collaboration.\nDespite these many advantages, using the two can lead to an increase in costs, especially if you are just starting out. For this reason, let us focus on how to set up free emails with both tools separately.\nIf you want to jump to one of the methods listed below, click the links below.\n- Method 1: Get a Free Business Email with Bluehost\n- Method 2: Get a Business email with Google Workspace\nMethod 1: Get a Free Business Email with Bluehost\nBluehost is a domain registrar and hosting service popular for offering WordPress sites and eCommerce stores fast speeds and great uptime at affordable prices.\nTo use its free business email service, you first need a domain name, email hosting, and email storage, which come as part of any hosting plan you get from Bluehost.\nBluehost also offers you a limited number of business emails with the basic plan and unlimited business emails with every plan after that.\nThis web hosting company stands out for its many integration abilities, connecting with widely used tools such as Outlook, Gmail, and Mailchimp. This helps you enjoy a smooth and convenient email experience as you can manage your inbox with tools you already know and use.\nAdded to that, Bluehost uses strong data privacy protocols to protect your sensitive information and maintain high security. These privacy measures cover every part of your emailing, providing you with peace of mind.\nIt also comes with advanced spam protection. This feature filters out spam, improving your email score. This, in turn, ensures your content lands in the primary inboxes of people actually interested in your content.\nWith the use of smartphones being so important today for a business owner or a startup, Bluehost allows you to access your email on your phone. Whether iOS or Android, setting up your business email account on your mobile device is easy, ensuring you stay connected wherever you are.\nStep 1: Set Up Hosting and Domain Name\nAs mentioned, the free business emails from Bluehost are tied to a hosting package. Therefore, the first step is to purchase a hosting plan.\nTo do this, head over to the Bluehost website and select Get Started Now, which will redirect you to the pricing page.\nBluehost has four options: Basic, Choice Plus, Online Store, and Pro; select one that suits your business needs and budget.\nAfter you select a plan, Bluehost will ask you to enter your existing website URL or create a new one. Remember that Bluehost gives you a free domain name with every web hosting plan you purchase. If you create a new custom domain at this point, you will not be charged extra.\nBluehost will check the availability of the custom domain name you want to create on the next page. If available, it will be Added To Cart. Follow this up by filling out the Account, Package, and Package Extras information.\nFinally, key in your payment details to purchase and create your account. With Bluehost, you can either pay with a Visa Card, Master Card, American Express Card, Discover Card, or Paypal. This makes it convenient for you to pay with whatever method you find best.\nYou will receive a confirmation email with details on how to log into your Bluehost dashboard and cPanel account, where you will manage your professional email address, hosting, and domain moving forward.\nStep 2. Create a Free Business Email Address\nOnce you confirm your account in your email inbox, head to the Bluehost dashboard. Then, on the left menu, select Cpanel Email, and a popup menu will appear.\nHere, select ‘Email Accounts,’ then hit Continue to take you to cPanel.\nNext, in your cPanel, find the Email tab. Here, you will find various emailing tools such as Forwarders, Spam filters, Mailing Lists, and more. To get started setting up your free business email, select Email Accounts.\nOn the next page, you will see the number of free emails available, the number of email addresses you have already used, and the option to create a new professional email address. Since this is your first business email, select Create.\nOn the next page, first, select the domain you want to create a business email for in the dropdown menu.\nNext, enter the username for your business email account and then enter or generate a password. Finally, select Create to proceed.\nBluehost should redirect you back to the Email Accounts page automatically. A green popup window should appear, letting you know the process was successful. You should also see the email account you just created added to this page with options to Check Email, Manage, and Connect Devices.\nTo add to that, you will also see the number of used email accounts increase by one and the number of email accounts you can still create displayed. This can help you plan out how you will use your email addresses better.\nIn this case, we have used one email and still have infinite emails we can create.\nCongratulations! You have just created a free business email with Bluehost.\nStep 3. Use the Business Email Account\nWith your free business email account created, the next step is sending and receiving messages.\nTo do this, click Check Email next to the business email name you have just created to be redirected to the webmail interface.\nUnder the Roundcube logo, select Open to log into your inbox.\nHere, you will quickly notice that the webmail interface is very similar to most email inboxes, meaning you will not experience any learning curve.\nIn the left-hand menu, you will see your Inbox, Sent, Draft, Spam, Delete, and Archive folders, like with most other email providers.\nThe top-most menu contains options like Calendar, Contacts, and Settings at the top right. Below that is the email taskbar with options to Refresh, Compose, Reply, Reply All, Forward, Delete, Archive, Mark, and more.\nUse this email interface as you would any other email provider, such as Gmail. You can send and receive emails, archive them, leave emails as drafts, and so on.\nStep 4: Connect Bluehost Email with Gmail or your Device\nSometimes, using webmail may be difficult since it may not be a tool you use every day. As a result, Bluehost allows you to connect your business email to your devices or Gmail for easier management.\nTo connect your devices, go back to the Email Accounts page in cPanel and find the business email you want to connect. At its far right, select Connect Devices.\nOn the setup page, you will find Mail Client Automatic Configuration Scripts. You will see a script to connect your business email to your iOS devices, Mozilla Thunderbird, Outlook, and more. You will also find Mail Client manual settings configurations as well below it.\nTo use Email applications like Microsoft Outlook 2010 and Mail for Windows, you will need to run the configuration scripts. The application will then automatically detect the email account’s settings and also provide detailed instructions to complete the setup process.\nHowever, for iOS, you will also need to set up the Bluehost email account on your device. If you want to learn more about this setup process, follow this tutorial on how to set up email on iOS Devices.\nNext, let us connect the business email to Gmail.\nTo do this, log in to your Gmail account and proceed to the Settings icon. Once selected, you will see a dropdown menu displaying plenty of customization options. Here, select ‘See All Settings.’\nIn the Settings window that will load next, go to the Accounts and Import tab. Next, scroll to ‘Check mail from other accounts’ and select Add a Mail Account.\nA new window will appear where you enter your Bluehost business email address in the “Email address” field. Proceed by selecting “Next.”\nIn the next window, select “Import emails from my other account (POP3)” and then select Next to proceed.\nYou will then be required to enter your username, password, POP Server, and port 995. Finally, select Add Account.\nOnce this is done, Gmail will then send an email to your Bluehost webmail for verification. Open the link and click it to confirm you are the owner.\nFinally, if you want to, configure the Bluehost emails in your Gmail account by adding a label so you can always identify them.\nThe final step is to Save the setting in your Gmail account. You can now receive your business emails from Bluehost right in your Gmail account.\nCongratulations! You have just fully set up a business email for free with Bluehost.\nNext, let us use Google Workspace to set up a business account.\nMethod 2: Get a Business email with Google Workspace\nAs mentioned, if you use Google Workspace to set up your business email, you will need to purchase a plan starting from $6 a month. However, with a 14-day free plan trial to test it out before you make your decision, you have nothing to lose.\nYou can use this cheap business email, even without a business website. However, the costs may add up as you also need to purchase an email domain.\nBut on the bright side, it comes with all the amazing app integrations and productivity tools you have come to expect from Gmail, such as Google Meet, Google Calendar, Google Drive, and more. These tools can help streamline workflow and everyday business activities to help improve productivity.\nOn the other hand, Google Workspace also comes with more business-focused tools such as Google Analytics, Google Tasks, and Google Cloud Search.\nSuch business solutions can help you get more insight into your business, helping you understand your audience better. They can also improve management by simplifying your team’s working experience by reducing the need for many tools.\nNow that you understand more about Google Workspace let’s see how you can create a business email with it.\nStep 1: Get a Google Workspace Plan\nHead to Google Workspace’s official site and select one of the 4 plans offered by clicking the Get Started button.\nOn the next page, enter the Business Name, Number of Employees, and Region.\nIf you are alone or starting out, under ‘Number of Employees’, we suggest you go with ‘Just You’ to avoid increased monthly fees.\nFollow this by filling in your name and current email address, and then proceed to the next page.\nNext, you will be asked whether you have a domain name. If you do not have one, Google will direct you on how to purchase one when you select ‘No, I Need One.’ Again, this will incur additional costs on top of the Google Workspace monthly cost.\nFor this tutorial, we will select ‘Yes; I have One I Can Use,’ which will start the verification process.\nOn the next page, type in your domain name and hit Next. Google Workspace will first verify your domain name before proceeding to the next page.\nNext, Google Workspace will ask you if you want to stay up to date by sending you occasional tips and offers. Select either ‘OK’ or ‘No Thanks.’\nYou will do the same thing on the next and similar page, where Google Workspace will ask you if you would like to educate your users. Here, the tool will send your users information about Google Workspace apps, new features, and tips to help improve productivity. Again, select ‘OK’ or ‘No Thanks.’\nOn the new page, you will enter a username and password for your new email. This username will also act as your first business email address. Once you make your decision on the username to use, select Agree and Continue.\nNext, add your personal information and go through the checkout process to pay for the plan you want.\nOnce this is done, select Continue. At this point, you should have successfully created a business email with Google Workspaces.\nStep 2: Verify Domain Name\nNext, use the business email account you have just created to log in to your Google Admin Console (admin.google.com). Here, Google Workspace will show you a tutorial on how to set up your business email. Go through it and make sure you have everything ready.\nThe first step is to verify your domain name. To do this, select Verify Domain on the warning message on your Google Admin Console dashboard homepage.\nIn the next window, you will see 3 options to set up your Google Workspace.\n- Verify your domain\n- Create new users\n- Active Gmail for your domain\nFor this setup tutorial, we will focus on verifying the domain and activating Gmail since we only have one user.\nLet us start the verification process of the domain by selecting ‘Verify.’\nOnce you hit verify, you will be redirected to a step-by-step verification page with codes to complete the process. Again, read through the steps and ensure you have everything set.\nNext, scroll down the page and copy the verification code provided. This code will always end with mx-verification.google.com. So check on this to make sure you have the right code.\n- Important: Leave this verification page open; use it as a guide and copy the codes.\nNext, head back to your Bluehost dashboard to locate TXT records in the domain settings so you can add the verification code.\nTo do this, go to Domains in your Bluehost dashboard. On the page, scroll down to locate the domain name you want to connect to the business email and select Settings.\nOn the new window, scroll to the bottom and find Advanced Tools. Then, select the dropdown arrow to expand the options. Then, go to ‘Manage’ Advanced DNS Records on the right.\nIn the next window, select Add Records to access Advanced DNS records. Next, type in the following information in the fields provided.\n- Type: TXT\n- Refers to: @\n- TXT Value: Insert the verification code you copied earlier from Google Workspace ending with mx-verification.google.com.\n- TTL: 1 hour (here, insert the number recommended by your web hosting provider. However, the number will not affect the process.\nFinally, hit Add to add the verification code to the DNS records.\nWith this complete, head back to Google Workspace’s verification page you left open and select Verify my Domain.\nOnce the page reloads, you should be redirected to the Google Workspace setup page. You will notice a blue tick next to your domain name, confirming it is verified.\nYou will also spot a circle chart at the very top, displaying the verification progress. You can use this chart to gauge what else you need to do and how many steps you will need to take.\nStep 3: Activate Gmail\nWith the domain verified, let’s proceed to set up emails to Gmail servers by selecting ‘Activate.’\nGoogle Workspace will then redirect you to the Activate Gmail process. The first page of this process is the Overview. Here, all you have to do is check the two boxes and select Continue.\nThis will take you to the ‘Route Emails to Gmail page.’ Here, you will be provided with instructions and codes to add to your Bluehost dashboard.\nAgain, we suggest you leave this page open to ensure you follow all the instructions and add the codes correctly.\nGoogle Workspaces will automatically detect the domain host you are using, offering you better and customized instructions to complete the setup process.\nCarefully read the ‘Route Emails to Gmail page’ first before you do anything else.\nRemember, these steps can change, so it is important to use the current instructions displaced on the page. Once done, you will see 5 MX records displayed at the bottom of the page. You will copy these codes one by one and add them to your Bluehost dashboard.\nWith your MX records ready and opened, proceed back to your Bluehost account. To change MX records, you will follow the same path you used above for TXT records.\n- Go to Domains, then select the domain you want to use\n- Select Settings.\n- Scroll down to Advanced Settings and select ‘Manage’ Advanced DNS Records on the right.\n- Finally, hit the Add Records button to open the ‘Advanced DNS Records’ popup.\nNext, enter the first MX record from the ‘Route Emails to Gmail’ page, similar to the ones displayed in the screenshot above.\n- Type: MX\n- Refer to: @\n- Mail Server: ASPMX.L.GOOGLE.COM\n- Priority: 1\n- TTL: 1 Hour\nOnce you have filled out all the fields, Select the Add button to connect the code to the MX records.\nRemember that you have 5 MX records you still need to add. Follow the same process as above to add the remaining 4.\nOnce complete, delete any default MX records provided by your host so that the new Google Workspace servers do not conflict with them. After this, the final MX records should look similar to the screenshot below.\nNow, head back to the ‘Route Emails to Gmail’ page in your Google Workspace dashboard and select ‘Activate Gmail.’\nNext, Google Workspace will direct you to the Checking Settings page to confirm if you have followed the right process. It will check each individual server address and priority number. It will also check to confirm you deleted the default MX records from your host.\nAfter the check is complete and every MX record is verified, the page will reload to direct you back to the Google Workspace setup page.\nYou will notice the progress chart has increased, and blue check marks next to your verified domain and Gmail activation, letting you know that the process was a success.\nGoogle Workspace will then log you out automatically and take you to the admin.google.com login page so that you can start managing your emails from your Google Admin Console.\nRemember that you should log in with the business email you have just set up. An ‘@gmail.com’ or personal email address will not work.\nOnce logged in to Google Admin Console, the first thing you should do is confirm if both the domain connection and Gmail activation were a success.\nTo do this, go to Domains » Manage Domains. On the right, you will see your domain listed. Check under the Status column, you should see the primary domain ‘Verified’ and ‘Gmail Activated.’\nCongratulations! You have just set up your business email using Google WorkSpace. Now, the only thing left to do is to send and receive emails.\nLuckily, it is super easy to access your business emails with Google Workspace.\nAll you have to do is log in the same way you would log in to any personal Gmail account. You will also find out that the inbox layout is similar to the personal Gmail inbox. From the layout, you can also add an email signature easily, to ensure you look more professional.\nIf you want to test if emailing is working, you can always send an email to your personal email and then send another from your personal email to your new business Google Workspace email.\nPlus, you can easily access all of Google Workspace by selecting the App Launcher icon at the top right corner of your inbox, just as you would with your personal Gmail inbox.\nYou can use Google Docs, Sheets, Slides, Meet, and more. You can also access Google Ads, News, Saved, Jamboard, and more.\nWell done!

We are now approaching the 370th month in succession that global temperatures have been above the 20th-century average. Yet, across the news channels, economists are insisting that London must expand an airport (but which one?) to sustain the inevitable growth in aviation. After 25 years of procrastination, why are we still waiting for policymakers and economists to accept the overwhelming evidence about climate change?\nLord Stern makes a strong argument for the economic and moral justification for action, just as he has done for close to a decade since he published his groundbreaking 700-page Review on the Economics of Climate Change. Stern argues repeatedly that it is an unprecedented threat and that a transition to low-carbon fuels will lead to a world that is “cleaner, quieter, safer, more energy-secure, more community-based and more biodiverse”. Hurrah for that.\nYet none of this is new: we have seen it in hundreds of reports, conferences and symposiums. Barack Obama, Margaret Thatcher, Robert Mugabe, Osama Bin Laden and now the Pope – surely the most improbable coalition in history – have all warned us. The most interesting question (and the promise of the book jacket) is “why it has been so difficult to tackle climate change effectively”.\nStern often seems perplexed by the question he seeks to answer. His rhetorical style is to present to us, in a neutral and noncommittal voice, a range of answers that “seem wise”, “useful” or “may have implications”. He frequently spirals into convoluted constructions such as: “If this interpretation is correct, then it would suggest that the task . . . may be more challenging than many believe.” This style exemplifies all too well why many people remain unengaged with such a dry, abstract and distant-seeming policy debate. Nobody talks about terrorism in this way.\nStern adheres to the central belief that “sound argument should be a necessary condition for sensible and rational action”. It is, he writes, “the arguments that matter”. Thus, for him, the polarisation and denialism that are throttling the political process across the English-speaking world are fuelled by faulty logic: “simple-minded objections”, based on a “handful of erroneous papers”. Challenging the sceptics, he outlines four criteria which can show that “basic common sense . . . points strongly to action”.\nBehind this carefully modulated language, one can sense a frustration with many people’s inability to think rationally. In interviews, he is far more candid, referring to those who disagree with him as “idiots” and “politically naive”.\nThis is, I fear, to misunderstand the nature of climate-change denial, which is in fact highly politically astute, well-informed and strategic. Denialism is not about bad information. Nor is it irrational. It is about the defence of deeply entrenched cultural values and economic power. Nowhere in this book does Stern deal adequately with this raw identity politics, even though few people have had such a sustained opportunity to see the political sausage-making process at such close quarters.\nIt is somewhat ironic that his title – Why Are We Waiting? – echoes the chant, sung awkwardly to the tune of “Oh, come, all ye faithful”, that accompanied so many social-rights campaigns of the 1970s. Stern makes only passing mention of the brutal political struggles of the past and ascribes the success of campaigns against slavery and apartheid to a change in “social attitudes”.\nThe examples he proposes when seeking case studies of previous “big, difficult structural changes” – smoking, lead in petrol and drink-driving – have little in common with climate change but much in common with his world-view. Each of them illustrates the dominant role of expert guidance, or, as Stern writes (with regard to smoking), the “expert-led, top-down, professional route to formulating policy”, combined with a moral calling to social responsibility.\nAs Stern confesses in the final chapter, however, cognitive psychology shows that all of us – expert professionals included – can be highly irrational. His friend Daniel Kahneman (to whom Stern refers breezily as “Danny”) won a Nobel prize for showing how cognitive bias permeates high-level economic decision-making. In Kahneman’s experiments, people consistently reject the arguments that seem so “rational” to Stern; driven by their cognitive bias, they avoid short-term costs even when they are told that this may lead to far higher costs in the long term. This innate bias is then reinforced by the social norms among policymakers, false optimism and selective storytelling.\nTechnocratic cultural bias may explain Stern’s greatest lacuna, a failure to recognise the central role that fossil-fuel production continues to play in corrupting the political process. Stern welcomes the removal of subsidies for fossil fuels – these distort the free market, after all – but gives no thought to a cap on their production or the $1trn per year that still pours into their expansion. Nor is he alone in this. The World Bank, his former employer, now routinely warns of catastrophic climate change while continuing to fund fossil-fuel production and carbon-based energy production – providing, by one estimate, up to $3bn per year.\nStern rightly complains that economists attempt to force everything into a cost-benefit analysis and notes, “When someone has a hammer, every problem looks like a nail.” He tries gamely to adopt other analytical tools yet there is no avoiding the reality: his life has been spent in the elite hammer culture of economic liberalism.\nSo, he brusquely discards the powerful critique of unlimited economic growth by his fellow economist Tim Jackson because it would “divert attention” into an “artificial race between growth and climate responsibility”. His commitment to the competitive market as the spur for innovation leads him to ignore the success of the Second World War’s command economies in transforming production. Surely these provide a better economic precedent for “big, difficult structural changes” than drink-driving?\nThat said, his critique of mainstream economics is still valuable and pertinent. Throughout his book, Stern keeps returning to the same core theme: that conventional economics is lousy at coping with intergenerational equity, in which the affluence of one generation is obtained at the cost of the others that will follow.\nHe is scathing about conventional economic models that have “grossly underestimated” the risks of future climate change. In a lengthy and often impenetrable section on discount rates (the rate at which utility declines over time), he shows that conventional theory so heavily discounts the future that it “comes close to saying, ‘Forget about issues 100 years or more from now’”.\nStern finds solace in moral philosophy, drawing on Kant and Aristotle to argue the ethical grounds for action in defence of the rights of those as yet unborn. His arguments, although maintaining his air of donnish abstraction, are an important attempt to place this nebulous issue within an intellectual tradition. It is when he drops the passive voice of the technical expert and speaks of his personal concerns for the vulnerable or future generations, however (as he charmingly showed in his Ted talk, standing next to his two-week-old grand-daughter), that he becomes most persuasive. Economics is a vital tool for implementation but it is these non-negotiable emotional values that are most likely to propel us into action.\nSo, why are we waiting? Because climate change is damned hard. It challenges us at almost every level of our identity and forces us to rethink what we assume to be true. Stern is a decent man struggling, like all of us, to cope with the immensity of this change and the challenge it poses to his world-view. I’m glad he is on our side.\nGeorge Marshall is a co-founder of the Climate Outreach and Information Network and the author of “Don’t Even Think About It: Why Our Brains Are Wired to Ignore Climate Change” (Bloomsbury)","metadata":{"date":1709057835000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947474676.79\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240227153053-20240227183053-00198.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9572967291,"token_count":1764,"url":"https:\/\/www.newstatesman.com\/culture\/2015\/07\/why-are-we-still-waiting-solution-climate-change-because-it-s-hard"},"score":2,"id":"61"}

{"text":"The Ultimate Checklist for Choosing an Art Consultant\nArt is a form of expression that can be used to capture the moment and express one's creativity. It has been around for centuries and will continue to evolve as we explore new ways to create art. For those who want an expert opinion on their artwork, it is important to choose the right person for them. This checklist for choosing an art consultant will help you make your decision.\nWhat To Consider In Choosing An Art Consultant?\nGallery openings, art auctions, and artist studio tours, if you're an art lover, then these events are the highlight of your social calendar. But unless you're a professional art buyer, it can be tough to know how to evaluate and purchase art. That's where an art consultant comes in. Art consultants can help you navigate the often-confusing world of art buying, and can provide expert advice on what pieces will best suit your taste and budget. If you're thinking of hiring an art consultant, use this checklist to make sure you choose the right one for you.\nConsider what type of art consultant you need.\nThere are two main types of art consultants, those who deal in contemporary art and those who deal in traditional art. Contemporary art is that which has been created within the past few decades, while traditional art is from earlier periods in history. If you're not sure what type of artwork you like best, it might be a good idea to consult with a consultant who specializes in the type of art you're interested in. Not all consultants are experts in every area of the art world. Some may specialize in only modern or only traditional artwork, while others may have more general knowledge about a range of styles. It's important to find a consultant whose area of expertise matches your interests and\nAsk around for recommendations.\nThe best way to find a good art consultant is by asking for recommendations from people you trust. Chances are, if someone you know has had a positive experience with an art consultant, they'll be more than happy to recommend that person to you. Ask your friends and family members if they have any recommendations, or do a quick Google search for art consultants near me.\nCheck the consultant's qualifications.\nNot all art consultants are created equal. Before you hire someone, make sure to check their qualifications and experience. Many consultants have degrees in art history or a related field, while others may have years of experience working with clients in the art world. Ask the consultant about their background and what type of work they do. This will give you a better idea of whether or not they're qualified to help you with your purchase.\nRead reviews online.\nOne of the best ways to get a sense of whether or not an art consultant is right for you is to read reviews online. Look for review websites or forums where people have discussed their experiences with different art consultants. This will give you a better idea of what to expect from the consultant and whether or not they're worth working with.\nGet an estimate.\nBefore you hire an art consultant, ask for a quote on how much they will charge to help you with your purchase. Most consultants charge either hourly or by the project, depending on what type of work they do and whether it's part-time or full-time employment. Make sure that their fee makes sense given the services they're providing and is worth hiring them for. Also, make sure to read any fine print in your contract so that there aren't any hidden fees involved.\nBy Dru Bloomfield - https:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/athomeinscottsdale\/3836187025\/in\/photostream\/, CC BY 2.0, https:\/\/commons.wikimedia.org\/w\/index.php?curid=95427764\nNo matter how qualified an art consultant may seem, it's always a good idea to ask them questions about their services and what they can do for you. This will help ensure that you're both on the same page and that you're getting the most out of your consultation. Ask about the consultant's experience, what type of artwork they specialize in, and what kind of budget you should have in mind. If there are any other questions you have, don't be afraid to ask them. A good consultant will be more than happy to answer all of your questions.\nTrust your gut.\nAbove all, trust your gut when it comes to choosing an art consultant. If something about the consultant doesn't feel right, or if you're not getting good vibes from them, it's probably best to move on and find someone else. Trusting your intuition is an important part of any purchasing decision.\nChoosing an art consultant is a big decision, so it’s important to be thorough in your research. We hope this checklist helped you narrow down the options and get started on finding the perfect match for both you and your home or business. If not, let us know. Our team of experts can provide insight into what type of art consultant might work best with your specific needs, just give us a call.\nAre You Looking for Contemporary Art to Complement Your Home?\nThe Marshall Gallery, located in Scottsdale’s Historic Arts District, has been the center of contemporary art since its founding in 1998.

{"text":"python3-pip package like this:\nsudo add-apt-repository universe\nsudo apt install python3-pip\nThere are numerous ways to install software on Ubuntu. You can install applications from the software center, from downloaded deb files, from PPAs, from Snap packages, using Flatpak, using AppImage and even from the good old source code.\nHere’s another way to install packages on Ubuntu. It’s called PIP and you can use it to install Python-based applications.\nWhat is pip?\nPip stands for “Pip Installs Packages”. Pip is a command-line based package management system. It’s used to install and manage software written in the Python language. You can use pip to install packages listed in the Python Package Index (PyPI).\nAs a software developer, you can use pip to install various Python modules and packages for your own Python projects.\nAs an end user, you may need pip for installing some applications that are developed using Python and can be installed easily using pip. One such example is the Stress Terminal application, which you can easily install with pip.\nLet’s see how you can install pip on Ubuntu and other Ubuntu-based distributions.\nHow to install pip on Ubuntu, Linux Mint and other Ubuntu-based distributions\nFirst, make sure that Python 3 is installed on Ubuntu. To check that, use this command:\nIf it shows you a number like Python 3.x.y, Python 3 is installed on your Linux system.\nNow you can install pip3 using the command below:\nsudo apt install python3-pip\nYou should verify that pip3 has been installed correctly using this command:\nIt should show you a number like this:\npip 22.0.2 from \/usr\/lib\/python3\/dist-packages\/pip (python 3.10)\nThis means that pip3 is successfully installed on your system.\npip command defaults to pip3 in Ubuntu 20.04 and above.\nInstalling Python packages [Recommended Way]\nRecently, a change has been done on distributions like Ubuntu 23.04 and upcoming Debian 12, regarding the installation of python packages.\nFrom now on, you should install Python packages either from native repositories, install in a virtual environment or use\nThis was implemented to avoid the conflict between OS package managers and Python-specific package management tools like pip. These conflicts include both Python-level API incompatibilities and conflicts over file ownership.\nUsing pip commands\nNow that you’ve installed pip, let’s quickly see some basic pip commands. These commands will help you use pip commands for searching, installing and removing Python packages.\nInstall a package with pip\nThere are two ways to install a package with PIP. You either install it for the currently logged-in user, or you install system-wide.\nIf you use\n--user option, it installs the package for the logged-in user, i.e., you, without needing sudo access. The installed python software is available only for you. Other users on your system (if any) cannot use it.\npip3 install --user python_package_name\nIf you remove the\n--user option, the package will be installed system-wide, and it will be available for all the users on your system. You’ll need sudo access in this case.\nsudo pip3 install python_package_name\nPIP doesn’t support tab completion by default. So you need to know the exact package name that you want to install. How do you get that? I show that to you in the next section.\nSearch for packages in PyPI\nTo search for packages in the Python Package Index, you can go to their official package search website.\nFor example, if you search on ‘stress’, it will show all the packages that have the string ‘stress’ in their name or description.\nPip had provided a command line search option, which was disabled due to excessive web traffic issues. So, if you try to use\npip search package-name, you will come across an error, as shown in the screenshot below.\nSo, use the PyPI website instead, as mentioned above.\nUpgrade Packages installed via pip\nTo upgrade packages installed via pip, use the command below:\npip3 install --upgrade <package-name>\nRemove packages installed via pip\nIf you want to remove a Python package installed via pip, you can use the remove option.\npip3 uninstall <installed_package_name>\nUninstall Pip from Ubuntu\nTo remove pip from Ubuntu, open a terminal and run:\nsudo apt remove python3-pip\nsudo apt autoremove\nPipx is better! Start using it instead of Pip\nActually, if you want to use Pip for installing Python-based GUI applications, you should use Pipx. It complies with the new Python guidelines.\nUsing Pipx is similar to Pip so it should feel familiar.\nI hope you like this tutorial on installing and using Pip on Ubuntu and hopefully on other distributions, too.

{"text":"During the Meiji period in Japan (1868-1912), woodblock prints, known as \"Meiji prints,\" underwent significant changes in style and subject matter. The Meiji period marked a time of modernization and Westernization in Japan, as the country opened up to the world after centuries of isolation.\nMeiji prints often depicted scenes of rapid modernization, such as industrialization, urbanization, and the introduction of Western technology and fashion. The prints reflected the changing society and the fascination with Western culture that emerged during this period.\nThe subjects of Meiji prints expanded beyond traditional ukiyo-e themes. They included images of political events, historical figures, landscapes, and portraits of influential individuals. The prints also depicted scenes from the Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895) and the Russo-Japanese War (1904-1905), reflecting Japan's military successes and nationalistic sentiments.\nIn terms of style, Meiji prints incorporated elements of Western art techniques and aesthetics. The use of perspective, shading, and realistic portrayal of figures became more prevalent. The prints also started to incorporate new materials and techniques, such as lithography and photography, alongside traditional woodblock printing.\nWhile Meiji prints were not as prolific or popular as ukiyo-e prints during the Edo period, they played a significant role in documenting and reflecting the societal changes and cultural shifts of the time.

{"text":"FarmBeats: Automating Data Aggregation\nDigital agriculture offers one of the most promising approaches to address the challenge of sustainably increasing food production by 70% by 2050 (from 2010 production levels). Using the latest advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), the farmer can be empowered with predictions that can improve farm processes, from planning until harvest.\nSatellite data and remote sensing techniques can provide agricultural insights, by using advanced image processing algorithms and AI algorithms on multiple spectral bands in satellite imagery to estimate crop health. However, satellite imagery alone is unable to capture all the data from the farms. Recent work has investigated the use of in-field sensors and imagery to complement satellite data, along with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), cameras and sensors on tractors. These data are streamed to the cloud using the latest Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, where they are processed to provide valuable insights to the farmer.\nHowever, there are two key challenges in enabling this IoT-enabled vision of data-driven farming. First is the ability to get data from the farm, as most farms have poor Internet connectivity. The second is how to make data from different modalities actionable by the farmers. The heterogeneous sensor streams need to be merged and analysed together with satellite data. In addition, data collection and analysis need to be done in a way that does not add to the farmer’s workload, but instead streamline efficiency.\nThe FarmBeats solution at Microsoft uses new technologies, such as TV white spaces and Azure IoT Edge, to collect large amounts of data from the farm via sensors, tractors, cameras, drones and other devices.

The BCSA is advising companies they need to familiarise themselves with this new standard now.\nThe standard is called BS EN 1090-2: Execution of steel structures and aluminium structures – Part 2: Technical requirements for the execution of steel structures. When published it will immediately replace current standards BS 5950 Part 2 (buildings), BS 5400 Part 6 (bridges) and BS 8100 (towers and masts).\nDr David Moore, BCSA Director of Engineering, said the new standard will introduce a number of issues that are different to the current British Standards for fabrication.\n“More responsibility is placed on the steelwork contractor to get it right first time, and more reliance is placed on the knowledge and competence of staff.”\nBS EN 1090-2 will also be a supporting standard for CE Marking, while it also introduces the concept of Execution Class. “In simple terms Execution Class determines the level of workmanship used to fabricate the structure,” explained Dr Moore.\n“Four classes are introduced from Class 4 which is the highest quality to Class 1 which is lowest.”\nThe Execution Class can apply to the whole structure, but it can also apply to individual details. A building could be classified as Execution Class 2, but a particular feature, such as a detail subject to fatigue, could be classified as Class 3.\nAs part of the increase in responsibility, the standard also requires steelwork contractors to have in place a welding quality management system that conforms to the requirements of the relevant part of BS EN 3834.\nBS EN 1090-2 will contain two types of tolerances, essential and functional. Both tolerances are mandatory, but essential tolerances are those that are declared as part of the CE Marking.","metadata":{"date":1709232896000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947474852.83\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240229170737-20240229200737-00698.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9439768195,"token_count":401,"url":"https:\/\/www.newsteelconstruction.com\/wp\/new-standard-for-fabrication-of-steel-structures\/"},"score":3,"id":"67"}
{"text":"Perhaps without even realising it, you’ve probably encountered radiography at some point in your life - whether that was getting an X-ray in A&E or knowing a family member who was receiving cancer treatment. While most of us are more familiar with the side that takes x-rays of bones, the field actually breaks down into two distinct disciplines: Therapeutic and Diagnostic Radiography.\nDespite diagnostic radiographers and therapeutic radiographers having very different roles, many people may not be aware of how these two important disciplines differ. In a nutshell, diagnostic radiography involves X-rays to diagnose disease and injury, such as broken bones, whilst therapeutic radiography deals with the delivery of cancer treatment.\nBelow, we go into some more detail which will hopefully give you a better understanding of these two fascinating areas of the radiography healthcare profession.\nSo, what is therapeutic radiography exactly and how does it differ from diagnostic radiography?\nTherapeutic radiography focuses on the planning and delivery of cancer treatment with radiation. Radiotherapy is one of the common ways to treat cancer, alongside surgery and chemotherapy, and involves applying targeted doses of radiation to kill cancer cells.\nThere are two main stages to a course of therapeutic radiography: planning and delivery. During the planning stage, scans are taken to determine exactly where the affected area is, create a treatment schedule before precisely calculating the dosage of radiation and where the beam will enter and exit the body.\nIn the delivery stage, a patient will attend daily radiotherapy sessions over their treatment schedule, which can often take weeks. An important part of the role is helping a patient manage any side effects and generally support them during their treatment.\nSince these courses of treatment are often a prolonged process, with patients seeing their therapeutic radiography every day for weeks at a time, therapeutic radiographers can get to know their patients quite well. Often, they become an important part of a patient’s support network while they go through a very difficult time in their lives.\nThis means that developing a deep connection with your patients is an important part of the discipline and therapeutic radiography offers people the opportunity to support their patients in ways that go further than the treatments themselves.\nDiagnostic radiography, on the other hand, focuses on using specialised technology to take high quality images of the inside of the body. Working alongside doctors, these scans and X-rays are used to diagnose and monitor illnesses and injuries, ensuring a patient gets the correct treatment.\nDiagnostic radiographers work in dedicated radiography departments as well as being an important part of A&E clinics. Rather than focusing specifically on the treatment of cancer, or any one illness, diagnostic radiographers will use advanced machinery to diagnose everything from broken bones to brain bleeds.\nThe role can often be fast paced and incredibly varied. Particularly when working in an A&E clinic, it is common to see many patients over the course of a single shift. Typically, a diagnostic radiographers will only see a patient once before they are passed onto another part of the hospital for treatment, which means they will see a range of different problems in a single day, so it’s a very varied and fast paced profession to work in.\nImportant distinction between these two healthcare professions\nWhere therapeutic radiographers are focused on cancer treatment and will often see the same patients on several occasions throughout their treatment period, diagnostic radiologists will constantly see different people with different injuries such as broken ankles, fractured wrists or more serious internal injuries. So, one of the very distinct differences between the roles is that a therapeutic radiographer has the opportunity to develop a supportive relationship with their cancer patients over the course of their treatment period, which could be up to several months; whereas a diagnostic radiographer is constantly dealing with many different patients with a wide range of different injuries or illnesses.\nFind out more about the undergraduate radiography courses at Queen Margaret University by visiting:","metadata":{"date":1709602111000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947476592.66\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240304232829-20240305022829-00798.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.959060967,"token_count":801,"url":"https:\/\/www.qmu.ac.uk\/campus-life\/blogs\/staff-louisa-armstrong\/the-difference-between-diagnostic-and-therapeutic-radiography\/"},"score":4,"id":"68"}
{"text":"Effects of radiation damage\non SIS performance\nT. Dotani and A. Yamashita (ISAS) and\nA. Rasmussen (MIT)\nand the SIS team\nSIS performance is gradually degrading due to the accumulated radiation damage. The effects of radiation damage are extensive: changes of energy scale, energy resolution, and detection efficiency. Details of these effects are explained together with the related calibration issues.\n1 Radiation damage\nIn the space environment, X-ray detectors are exposed to high energy particles. Particle flux is especially large in the South Atlantic Anomaly, and charged produce lattice defects in solid state detectors, such as the SIS onboard ASCA. The SIS utilizes X-ray CCDs, and lattice defects in CCDs mainly have two effects on performance: charge traps and dark current.\nLattice defects make an intermediate energy level in the forbidden band, and such an intermediate level can work as an electron trap. This means that if a charge packet encounters an empty trap during the transfer, an electron will be caught in the trap and is removed from the packet in the subsequent transfer unless it is released immediately. Thus traps lead to loss of electrons from the charge packet, and hence charge transfer efficiency (CTE) becomes lower than unity. In the case of the SIS, charge packets are typically transferred 10^3 times before read-out. Very small degradation of CTE (eg ~0.99999) will lead to significant loss of charge. Hereafter, we use charge transfer inefficiency (CTI [[equivalence]] 1-CTE) instead of CTE for convenience.\nLattice defects can also increase dark current. Even without X-ray (or optical light) irradiation some thermally excited electrons are accumulated in the pixel. This charge is called dark current. In the case of the SIS, dark current was negligibly small before launch compared to the typical size of charge packet produced by X-rays. However, dark current has been gradually increasing after launch due to accumulated radiation damage. The immediate effect of the dark current may be excess noise due to the statistical fluctuation of the dark current and hence degradation of the energy resolution. Note that dark current itself will not introduce an offset of energy scale in principle. The zero point of the energy scale is estimated onboard, but as seen later this onboard estimate is systematically low. A positive pulse-height offset is thereby introduced in the energy-pulse-height relation that turns out to be mode dependent.\nRadiation damage brings a lot of changes in SIS performance, such as change of energy scale, energy resolution and detection efficiency through these two effects. These changes are described in detail in the following sections.\n2 CTI measurements with Cas A\nBecause CTI causes systematic reduction of X-ray photon energy, we can use the reduction to measure the CTI. If we put an X-ray source having prominent and stable emission lines on several different positions on a CCD chip, the line center energies are expected to show small but systematic shifts depending on the source positions. We can estimate CTI from these systematic shifts. We selected the supernova remnant Cas A as a target for CTI calibration; it is bright and relatively compact, and has strong emission lines.\nWhen we measure CTI, we should be careful about the relation between clock\nspeed and CTI. As explained in Section 1, CTI results from the charge traps.\nEven if an electron is caught in a trap, it will not produce CTI if the\nelectron is released while the charge packet stays on the pixel. Therefore,\ntraps which easily release an electron will not contribute to CTI. At the other\nextreme, if the trap is very slow in releasing an electron, it is effectively\nkept filled and again contributes little to CTI. Thus, only the traps whose\ntime scale of releasing electron is comparable to the clock time scale is\nexpected to contribute significantly to CTI. In other words, we need to measure\nCTI for each clock of CCD.\nFigure 1Three kinds of clocks used in SIS are explained. The ST clock moves the charge packets from imaging region to frame store region, the parallel clock transfers the charge packets line by line to serial register, and the serial clock shifts the charge packets pixel by pixel in the serial register to the read-out gate.\nThe SIS uses 3 kinds of clock: ST clock, parallel clock and serial clock. The function of each clock is explained in Figure 1. These three clocks have different periods (the time between \"ticks\"). The ST clock and the pixel clock are fast, but the parallel clock is slow. The periods of each clock are listed in Table 1.\nObservations of Cas A were carried out in August 1993 and July 1994. The SIS was set in 1-CCD faint mode in both sets of observations. In the 1994 observations, there were three pointings for each chip, but the data were taken only with the standard chips in 1993. Two out of three pointings are arranged to differ only in h\/v-address. Thus we can measure the shift of line center energy due to parallel\/serial CTI separately. The CTIs determined from the line center shifts are listed in Table 2. Although it was not obvious how CTI depends on the X-ray photon energy, we found that the data are consistent with constant CTI. In other words, charge lost by CTI is proportional to the original size of the charge packet. Parallel and serial CTIs were determined from the data in 1994, but ST CTI cannot be determined from 1994 data only because the number of transfers by the ST clock is the same for all the pixels. We determined degradation of the ST CTI by comparing 1993 and 1994 data, and converted the degradation to an absolute value assuming that the CTI was zero at launch and increased linearly with time. This assumption turned out to be good because serial\/parallel CTIs determined from 1993 and 1994 observations are consistent with no CTI at launch.\n*Estimated value assuming that ST CTI increases proportionally to time after the launch.\nThe above determination of CTI assumes that CTIs are uniform over the chip. However, we suspect that there may be significant variations of CTI over the chip. Negative values of serial CTI in S1C3 may be due to this non-uniformity.\n3 Relative gain\nIn the previous section, we used only the difference of line center energies to determine the CTIs. It is a different problem whether or not line center energies become consistent between chips after CTI correction. Figure 2 shows the line center energies of Si K[[alpha]], S K[[alpha]] and Fe K[[alpha]] of Cas A obtained with 1994 data after CTI correction.\nFigure 2 Line center energies of Cas A after CTI correction. CTI values used were determined from the same observations (1994 data). Three data points in a chip correspond to three different pointings, denoted as h, v, and o. Line center energies in a chip are almost same, which means consistency between CTI determination and correction.\nIt is clear from the figure that the line center energies are different from chip to chip by at most 2%. However, we adjusted the relative gain of chips to better than 0.5% using W49B data in 1993. So, some systematic errors which we were not aware of should have been present in the gain calibration with W49B (this systematic error is explained in the next section). This motivated us to monitor the long-term history of the gain.\n4 Gain history\nNi fluorescence lines in the SIS background are effectively the only structure in the energy spectrum available to monitor long-term history of the gain. Because 1-CCD mode data were taken only with standard chips, we accumulated the Ni line data only for the standard chips. Ni line data were accumulated from all the available data until November 1994 except for those close to the bright Earth or including bright target in the FOV.\nThere is one thing we need to keep in mind when we analyze Ni line data. The Ni line is believed to originate from the kovar which covers the frame store region of the chips (see figure 2 on page 6 in ASCANews no.2). However, some part of the Ni line was suspected to originate in the exposure region. The ratio of the Ni line flux between the exposure region and the frame store region can be determined in principle by comparing the Ni line fluxes of 1-CCD and 4-CCD modes. When we compare the fluxes, we need to correct the decrease of the detection effeciency due to RDD (see Section 7). We found that the flux ratio is F^(FS)_Ni ): F^(IM)_Ni) ~ 3 : 1, where F_Ni is defined as a flux in unit area (not pixel).\nWe cannot directly correct CTI for Ni line events because the number of transfers is not known for events produced in the frame store region. However, we can estimate the average shift of Ni line energy ([[Delta]] ENi) due to CTI using the flux ratio (F(^FS)_Ni : F^(IM_Ni) ) estimated above. In what follows, CTI correction for Ni line is done by simply adding [[Delta]] ENi to the apparent center energy of the Ni line.\nFigure 3 Long-term history of Ni line energy for standard chips in 1-CCD mode (Figure 3a) and in 4-CCD mode (Figure 3b). Broken lines are apparent Ni line center energy and solid lines are that corrected for CTI and systematic energy shift in frame store region due to different pixel size. The dotted line is the expected K[[alpha]] line energy from neutral Ni (7.4723 keV).\nThe long-term history of the Ni line energy is shown in Figure 3. The Ni line energy in 1-CCD mode is almost constant after CTI correction, although there is a slight indication of annual variations. Systematic difference from the expected Ni K[[alpha]] line energy may be a calibration error. The difference of the gain between s0c1 (sensor 0, chip 1) and s1c3 (sensor 1, chip 3) is about 0.5% and is consistent with the Cas A results. On the other hand, 4-CCD mode data show clear contrast. The apparent line energy is almost constant, which means it increases after CTI correction. The difference of Ni line energies between 1 and 4-CCD modes is as large as 100 eV by the end of 1994. These results agree surprisingly well with the expected systematics stemming from zero-level errors outlined in the following section, specifically the upper panel of Figure 6. Thus, the constancy of the apparent Ni line energy (in 4-CCD mode) is very likely to be due to competing effects of CTI and the RDD. However, it is desirable to have independent measurements of CTI in 4-CCD mode (and also in 2-CCD mode), which is planned in August 1995.\nThe discrepancy between Ni line energies for 1- and 4-CCD mode may explain the calibrated gain error between chips (Figure 3): The W49B data used to calibrate gains were gathered from the various clocking modes. However, the subtle, mode- dependent systematics were not corrected for in the analysis, so it is certain that the unremoved systematics translated into small gain calibration errors.\n5 Residual dark distribution\nSIS Image data usually contain a small number of X-ray and charged particle events and most of the pixels are blank. The zero level of the energy scale, or dark level, is calculated onboard as an average pulse height of blank pixels. Only the blank pixels whose pulse height falls between -40 ADU and 40 ADU are used for this calculation. Dark level is calculated for a region of 16x16 pixels to accommodate the global variation of dark level over a chip. Onboard calculation of the dark level sometimes can not follow up the rapid change of the dark level due to the optical light leak, and this produces so-called dark frame error (DFE). DFE can be in principle corrected in the course of ground data analysis for faint mode data. The dark level of individual pixels has a statistical fluctuation around the global mean. In the ideal case, this fluctuation has a gaussian distribution and the width of the distribution corresponds to the read-out noise of the CCD.\nRadiation damage increases the dark current. This means that blank pixels tend to have higher pulse height. However, a global increase of the pulse height of the blank pixels does not affect the energy scale, because the zero level of the energy scale is determined as an average of the blank pixels. The problem is the increased scatter of dark levels among pixels. We found that the dark level distribution became wider and asymmetric with increasing radiation damage. We refer to this distribution which remains after DFE correction as residual dark distribution (RDD).\nFigure 4 Examples of the residual dark distribution (RDD) in 1-CCD and 4-CCD modes at two different epochs. Normalization of the plot reflects exposure time and source flux, and should be regarded as arbitrary. The solid line is the best-fit model function (eq. 1).\nExamples of the RDD are shown in Figure 4. These are corner pixel distributions of grade 0, 2, 3, 4 events in faint mode data after DFE correction. The corner pixels of these grades are considered to be almost free from charges produced by X-rays or charged particles. Therefore, the pulse height distribution of corner pixels is a good approximation of the RDD. RDD is wider and more asymmetric in 4-CCD mode than in 1-CCD mode. This is natural because longer exposure (16 sec for 4-CCD mode and 4 sec for 1-CCD mode) means larger dark current. Similarly, recent data show larger asymmetry than the older data. It may be worth mentioning that RDD is closely connected to flickering pixels. The high energy tail of the RDD extends beyond the event threshold (=100 ADU). This means that some pixels have large dark current which can mimic an X-ray event. Thus the flickering pixels are in fact just the high energy tail of the RDD. In this sense, pixels with large dark current are sometimes referred to as micro-flickering pixels.\nWe found that RDD can be approximated by the following model function.\nThis model function is a convolution of a d-function plus an exponential hard tail with a gaussian of width [[sigma]]. Fraction (f) represents the ratio of micro-flickering pixels, centroid (q0) is the true zero of the energy scale, and the exponential scale (Q) is a measure of the accumulated charge with RDD.\nRDD has various effects on SIS performance. We explain systematics brought by the RDD in detail in the following sections.\n6 Energy scale shift\nRDD brings two kinds of effect on the energy scale. One is a zero level offset and the other is a systematic shift of line energy through the distortion of the line profile.\nIt is easily understood that onboard calculation of the dark level suffers from systematic offset due to the asymmetry of the RDD because the onboard calculation is just a truncated mean of the pulse height of blank pixels. This offset is further modified by data reduction at ground through DFE correction. DFE correction software cross-correlates the corner pixel distribution of the data being processed and a template distribution. The template is in fact a corner pixel distribution of 1-CCD data in early 1993 and hence its distribution is almost symmetric and peaked close to zero. Thus the current DFE correction effectively aligns the distribution peak close to zero, which is always less than the truncated mean: the effective DFE \"correction\" correspondingly introduces a positive pulse height offset equal to this difference. Thus, while the on-board dark level underestimates the \"best\" zero level, the current DFE correction underestimates it by a larger measure: the offset in the gain solution is inflated as a side-effect of using FAINTDFE. Incidentally, this is no accident. The original need for FAINTDFE was to align data for which the dark level calculation was out of equilibrium. In order to align faint mode data, for example, with bright mode, with a significant equilibrium DFE, appropriate models for the cross-correllation template must be used.1 These templates are currently under development and testing for use with FAINTDFE.\nFigure 5 Line profile change due to RDD for grade 0 events. Simulated energy spectrum of SIS is shown for a model of a power law (photon index 1.7) plus a narrow line. Note that only the RDD effect related to the energy resolution is demonstrated here; degradation of the detection efficiency is not simulated.\nThe RDD also changes the line profile. The usual line profiles were originally determined by considering effects of charge generation, drift and collection, readout noise and details of the ASCA SIS event selection and pulse height recipes. Because an incident X-ray strikes a CCD pixel and thereby samples the RDD at random, the line profiles may still be predicted, provided that the readout noise distributions are replaced by the RDD everywhere. A line profile should still exhibit a low pulse height shoulder located within about a split threshold (~ 140 eV) of the peak, but as the RDD becomes broader and less symmetric, the profile grows a tail on the high pulse height side. Thus the line profile may become approximately symmetricby coincidence. We show a simulated spectrum of SIS in Figure 5 to demonstrate the RDD effect on the line profile. Note the high energy tail of the line profile and the shift of the line center. The decrease of the detection efficiency due to RDD (see Section 7) is not included in this demonstration.\nFigure 6(Upper panel) Systematic offsets of the line center energy at 6.6 keV due to the RDD are shown for various clocking modes and analysis methods. Solid, dashed, dotted lines correspond to 4-CCD, 2-CCD and 1-CCD mode data, respectively. Note that DFE correction increases systematic offsets. (Lower panel) Degradation of the energy resolution at 6.6 keV due to the RDD.\nThe current versions of SIS response matrices do not include the RDD effects. Thus, if we fit an energy spectrum affected by RDD with a model function, the line center energy suffers from a systematic shift. As mentioned above, the RDD effectively underestimates the \"best\" zero, and the first moment of the response undergoes a systematic shift in the positive pulse height direction. Figure 6 (upper panel) shows the expected systematic offset of the line center energy due to the RDD for a narrow line at 6.6 keV in various clocking modes. The amount of the shift is not very sensitive to the line energy. As seen from the figure, DFE correction increases systematic offset of the line center energy.\nFigure 6 also shows the degradation of the energy resolution due to the RDD at 6.6 keV. RDD is much broader than the distribution of the read-out noise at launch and hence degrades the energy resolution. Although FWHMs for DFE-corrected data are not shown here, we expect moderately worse resolving power for this grade combination: For a given grade, the DFE correction introduces only a shift in pulse height, so the resolution should not be affected. In the standard grade combination g0234 however, we combine single-pixel pulse height calculations with two-pixel calculations, so the pulse height shift carries along with it an additional broadening. This broadening is certainly energy dependent, because the grade branching ratios vary with energy.\n7 Detection efficiency\nRDD not only changes the energy scale\/resolution of SIS, but also changes the detection efficiency. An X-ray photon produces a charge cloud which extends at most a few pixels. The onboard processor looks for a pixel which exceeds the event threshold (=100ADU ~ 0.35 keV) and, if found, examines neighboring 8 pixels. If the pixel is a local maximum among 3x3 pixels, it is regarded as an event. Further processing may be done by the onboard processor (bright mode) or on the ground (faint mode). The surrounding 8 pixels are compared with the split threshold (=40 ADU), and the events are classified into grades according to the number and pattern of pixels which exceed the split threshold. If no pixel exceed the split threshold, the event is classified as grade 0, and higher grade is assigned to event which have larger number of pixels exceeding the split threshold. Because X-ray events usually do not extend more than 4 pixels, high grade events are regarded as non X-ray events. In the case of the SIS, grades 1, 5, 6, and 7 are regarded as non X-ray events.\nFigure 7Estimated long-term variations of the detection efficiency at 6.6 keV due to RDD. Solid, dashed, dotted lines correspond to 4-CCD, 2-CCD and 1-CCD mode data, respectively. Echo virtually adds a certain fraction of charge to the next read-out pixel, and tends to change the grade of event to higher one (filled symbols). This effect can be corrected at the ground for faint mode data (open symbols).\nThe RDD effect increases the probability of a pixel exceeding the split threshold. Lower grades of events, which are mostly X-ray events, may become higher grade of events if some of the 8 surrounding pixels exceed the split threshold. If X-ray events are changed to grades 1, 5, 6, 7, they are regarded as non X-ray events and hence removed from later processing. Thus the RDD effect alters the grade branching ratio and hence detection efficiency of the X-ray events. Figure 7 shows the long-term variations of the detection efficiency due to RDD at 6.6 keV. Reduction of the detection efficiency is most prominent in 4-CCD mode data without echo correction. In the case of 1-CCD mode data, only the reduction of detection efficiency due to the echo is seen. Increase of the echo ratio was saturated by about a year after launch.\nTo illustrate the overall effect of the RDD on the SIS broadband response, we show in Figure 8 several semi Monte Carlo spectra of 3c273 in various clocking modes. Because 1-CCD mode data are little affected by the RDD, we can get a rough idea how RDD modifies the apparent energy spectrum by comparing 1-CCD and 4-CCD results. Detection efficiency is reduced in overall energy range and the instrumental sharp structures in the spectrum (oxygen K, silicon K, and gold M edges) are smoothed out due to the degraded energy resolution. In addition, the low-energy efficiency suffers substantially as a significant fraction of the response profile falls below detection threshold. This is a direct result of the asymmetric RDD: down-shifted pulse height medians close to pulse height thresholds are stochastically rejected, which effectively smears out and inflates these thresholds. Noninflated thresholds currently stand at 120 and 160 ADU in 4-CCD mode, corresponding to 440 and 580 eV for single pixel and two-pixel events, respectively.\n8 Calibration database and analysis software\nTo cope with the degradation of SIS performance due to radiation damage, updates of calibration database and analysis software are now in progress.\nBecause the relative gain between chips was calibrated using all 1\/2\/4-CCD mode data of W49B, which are now known to have different CTI\/RDD effects, it includes relatively large systematic error. As explained so far, we have calibrated the gain with Ni line in the background and Cas A observations. The new gain will be released after consistency check with the previous calibration.\nFigure 8 Simulated spectra of 3c273 (in December 1993) in various clocking modes at two different epochs. Left panel shows the spectra expected at 2 years after the launch, and right panel those of 4 years after the launch. These histograms are of actual flight faint mode (3 x 3) data. Expected RDD effects were introduced by Monte Carlo corruption of all pixels, such that the corner pixel distributions are consistent with current, best projections (by Yamashita and Dotani) of the RDD evolution. Naturally, this includes the RDD-driven, self-consistent onboard zero level error. Onboard processing of this data was also simulated to produce these histograms.\nThe current program of DFE correction introduces a systematic offset in the energy scale when applied to the data with RDD. We need to use an appropriate template depending on the clocking modes and time after the launch. Because the template is in fact RDD itself, we can use the model function in equation 1. We have found analytic formulae which can describe the long-term variations of the parameters in equation 1 for 1\/2\/4-CCD modes. The new DFE correction program will use the model function, which is determined by the clocking mode and observation time, as a template.\nCTI in 1-CCD mode was measured with Cas A data. But, as explained in Section 4, CTI may depend on the clocking mode of CCD. Because we do not have appropriate data to determine the CTI in 2\/4-CCD modes, we are planning to observe Cas A once again in August in 1995. CTI in 2\/4-CCD modes will be determined with these new data.\nBecause RDD effects are not easy to correct at ground data processing, the effects should be included in the response matrices. This means that SIS matrices would become clocking mode and time dependent. The effort of upgrading the response builder is continuing.\nWe have made substantial progress in understanding the effects of radiation damage on SIS performance. As has been shown in sections 6 and 7, the RDD has degraded 4-CCD mode data so as to make this mode unusable; 2-CCD mode may also become unusable in the foreseeable future. Unfortunately, this severely limits the scope for future observations of extended sources with the SIS. However, 1-CCD mode continues to function well and, therefore, point source observations are affected little.

{"text":"As we continue with Eastertide, Paul and Barnabas continue to proclaim the Good News of the risen Christ and structuring the growing church communities. Together with the Psalmist they praise God for his compassion and graciousness to all including the Gentiles.\nIn the second reading John takes us into his vision of a new creation; a new heaven and a new earth and now the dwelling of God is with his people. This newness is brought about by Jesus Christ through his new commandment to love one another as he loves us. This is the key to transforming the world. To be recognized as Jesus’ disciples, we are to love one another.\nJesus’ giving of the new commandment is an invitation to continue his presence in this world in a new way. If we love one another Jesus will continue to be present in the world; in our midst. Loving as Jesus loved makes this commandment new. Jesus gave himself as a model and source of boundless love. Universal love that could transform negative circumstances and perceptions into opportunities of learning to progress in love.\nJesus’ words acquire resonance for us today when we are an active and generous church; both laity and clergy. In giving us his new commandment Jesus asks us to live his own love and on his own love which is credible, eloquent and effective sign of a new creation.\nIn us there are many prejudices and hatred, divisions and competitions. These are obstacles to love and live in Jesus’ love.\nThe power to love is communicated to us in the relationship with Jesus in the Eucharist, in which the sacrifice of love is present and generates love which can bring the true newness of creation.\nJoy and peace.","metadata":{"date":1709338583000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947475711.57\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240301225031-20240302015031-00598.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9713793993,"token_count":351,"url":"https:\/\/minsccs.org\/2019\/05\/18\/fifth-sunday-of-easter\/"},"score":3,"id":"72"}
{"text":"|The Thursday Friends are a group of quilters who get together regularly to learn new techniques and to share ideas and projects. The group serves as volunteer coordinators for the annual fall quilt show at Olbrich Gardens in Madison and has made some of the large quilts which Olbrich raffles every year. Rosemary Schmidt, former MATC instructor, serves as facilitator of the informal group. Members are also part of the larger quilt guild of Madison, \"Mad City Quilters.\" For this exhibit the Friends are pleased to add Rumi O'Brien's special story quilt to those done by members of the group.\n|Quilts have been made for many hundreds\nof years. In this country the quilting tradition really took off\nin the nineteenth century as pioneer women sought interesting ways to use\nup fabric scraps while keeping their families warm. Over the years\nquilting evolved into a highly personal folk art form entailing craft\nas well as creativity, and exhibiting a wide range of traditional and innovative\nQuilts are composed of three layers: a top, a backing, and some kind of batting or filling. They are often described as a textile sandwich, and the quilting is actually the stitching that holds the three layers together and prevents the filling from shifting. Pieced quilts are quilts whose tops are made from the stitching together of many individual pieces of fabric. Applique quilts are made with a foundation fabric onto which many individual pieces are sewn. Quilts today can be HAND PIECED, MACHINE PIECED, HAND APPLIQUED, MACHINE APPLIQUED, and HAND QUILTED or MACHINE QUILTED. You will see examples and combinations of each in this exhibit.\n|Quilting today involves more than just creating coverings for beds. Many traditional and contemporary designs are being made on a smaller scale as wall hangings, draperies, tablecloths, and clothing. The pieces on display here reflect this range, and demonstrate a wide variety of techniques. Rumi O'Brien's story quilt is an example of a large wall hanging completely hand appliqued and hand quilted.\n|Ginny Riker's kaleidoscope is a bed-sized\nquilt which is machine pieced and machine quilted. The exhibit includes\ntraditional patterns such as Wedding Ring, Mariner's Compass, Trip Around\nthe World, and Stars, as well as more modern techniques such as Stained\nGlass, Bargello (tapestry-like), Watercolor (Monet inspired\nusing small blended flower fabrics), and Three-dimensional Applique with\nfolded fabric and embellishments.\nThe exhibit also includes a style of quilting called the landscape quilt. With this modern technique the quilter essentially paints a picture with fabric and uses extensive machine quilting to help achieve depth and definition. Donna Willadsen's landscape demonstrates these techniques using some of the many fabrics now on the market designed especially for quilters.\n|Although many simple and utilitarian quilts\nare still made today, most contemporary quilts can be considered\nhighly sophisticated art forms. The ability to design and to manipulate\ncolor, harmony, scale, pattern, and texture are skills inherent in the\nquilt artist. There are many quilt shows each year in the Madison\narea and in southern part of Wisconsin that showcase the talents of both\nmen and women quilters.\nThis exhibit was put together by the Thursday Friends. Exhibitors include: Theresa Acker, Janis Browning, Adelle Bilzing, Carolyn Cain, Bertie Lou Davis, Marilee Gardner, Carol Hanson, Becki Kurtz, Gini Riker, Rosemary Schmidt, Donna Willadsen, and story quilt designer, Rumi O'Brien.\nAs always, a heartfelt thank you to Rhoda Braunschweig who plans and David Braunschweig who assists in \"hanging\" each exhibit.\nCopyright © 2001.\nThe Dining Room at 209 Main\nWEAVING WITH SEWING THREAD\nHISTORIC MONTICELLO WOOLEN MILL\nKatherine Pence Inspired by Everything\nWHY DO I SPIN?\nTHE EARLY KNITTED WORKS OF JOYCE WILLIAMS","metadata":{"date":1709337201000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947475711.57\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240301225031-20240302015031-00599.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.948558569,"token_count":903,"url":"http:\/\/www.monticellowi.com\/textilesJun01.htm"},"score":3,"id":"73"}

The Board also discovered that Fabulian “actively practiced medicine for about six years without malpractice insurance.”\nAccording to an Order Continuing Suspension by the Board, prior to pleading guilty, Fabulian “denied any improper sexual misconduct with Patients #1 and #2” and “presented a packet of patient testimonials as to the efficacy of his practice.”\nAs reported in a 2006 article, Fabulian claimed to have treated Lyme patients for 6 years. He was quoted as saying, “I see at least 200 Lyme patients a month here, probably 15 new patients a week.”\nThis is an absurd number of Lyme patients for one family doctor to be treating, even in a state like Pennsylvania with many real cases of Lyme disease. Remember, real Lyme disease is curable with a short course of generic antibiotics.\nThe Board Order alleged of Fabulian (“Respondent”):\n- According to the police criminal complaint, a female patient (Patient #1) reported to the Kennett Square Police Department that during an appointment she had with Respondent in October 2008, Respondent grabbed the collar of her blouse and looked down at her breasts, and that Patient #1 pushed his hands away from her body.\n- Patient #1 reported that Respondent hugged her and kissed her on the neck, that Respondent kissed her approximately ten times, that Respondent licked her neck, and that Respondent told her, “You taste so good.”\n- According to the police criminal complaint, a female patient (Patient #2) reported to the Kennett Square Police Department that during an appointment she had with Respondent in May 2010, Respondent hugged her tightly during the examination and kissed her on the lips, telling her he wanted to take in her scent, and that Patient #2 pulled away from Respondent.\n- Patient #2 reported that Respondent kissed her on her neck and grabbed her right hand and placed it on his groin area, and that Patient #2 could feel his erection.\nThe Inquirer described Fabulian’s sentencing as follows:\nAssistant District Attorney Andrea Cardamone, who sought a six-month jail term, said that after Fabulian was charged with assaulting two women, others came forward. She said that two were within the statute of limitations and that the District Attorney’s Office agreed not to file additional charges in exchange for Fabulian’s cooperation.\nShe said the agreement also included a provision that the court would hear about the other two cases to show a pattern.\nDuring a hearing that lasted nearly three hours, Cardamone presented two witnesses and read a letter from a third. The women are not being identified by The Inquirer because of the nature of the offenses.\nBoth described Fabulian’s sexual overtures as an excruciating breach of trust. The first woman said she had to wait a year and a half for charges to be filed after contacting police because authorities said another victim would bolster her case.\nThe Delaware County Daily Times reported:\nSpeaking to Judge David Bortner before he imposed sentence, the victims said the assaults left them severely traumatized.\n“What he did to me will affect me for years to come,” said a patient who Dr. Peter Fabulian groped after she came to him for treatment. “He has taken away the sacred trust that a patient has with a physician.”\n“I felt dirty, foolish and embarrassed for something I didn’t do,” another woman wrote to Bortner. She said she still feels nauseous when she thinks of his smile as he began fondling her. “His behavior was purposeful, calculated and chronic.”\nThe Delaware County Daily Times: Kennett Square doc gets jail for fondling patients\nThe Southern Chester County Weeklies: Kennett Square doctor loses license for sexual assault\nThe Philadelphia Inquirer: Doctor sentenced in indecent assaults on patients\nLancasterOnline: Strasburg doc to prison\nThe Philadelphia Inquirer: Lyme disease underreported, experts say\nPennsylvania State Board of Osteopathic Medicine: Peter Fabulian Final Order\nPennsylvania State Board of Osteopathic Medicine: Peter Fabulian Memorandum Order Continuing Temporary Suspension\nNew Jersey State Board of Medical Examiners: Peter Fabulian Final Order of Discipline\nUnited States Bankruptcy Court: Opinion about one of Fabulian’s patients","metadata":{"date":1709471226000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947476374.40\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240303111005-20240303141005-00699.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9670795202,"token_count":1075,"url":"https:\/\/lymescience.org\/peter-fabulian-lyme-literate-doctor-llmd\/"},"score":1,"id":"80"}
{"text":"Recent events in the House of Commons have reignited discussions about the power of public figures to shape public discourse and inclusivity. While avoiding politicisation remains crucial, open and respectful dialogue about the impact of words and actions on diverse communities is essential.\nBeyond “Us vs. Them”:\nIt’s vital to acknowledge that humans are intricate beings with multifaceted identities shaped by experiences, beliefs, and characteristics far beyond singular aspects like gender or biology. Reducing someone to a single aspect fuels harmful stereotypes and hinders understanding.\nAcceptance as a Bridge:\nAcceptance doesn’t equate to agreeing with everything someone says or does. It signifies creating safe spaces for genuine dialogue and understanding, even amidst differing perspectives. Advocating for “acceptance without understanding™” resonates deeply as it fosters empathy and opens doors to genuine curiosity and learning. This approach recognises the intrinsic value of every individual, regardless of their background or identity.\nEcho Chambers and the Power of Perception:\nEcho chambers, where individuals primarily encounter information reinforcing their existing beliefs, threaten understanding and inclusivity. When public figures, wielding influence and authority, use language that excludes or disrespects certain groups, they inadvertently solidify these echo chambers and amplify existing biases. This can significantly impact public perception and understanding, potentially hindering meaningful dialogue and amplifying divisions.\nThe Anchoring Effect and Confirmation Bias:\nOur initial impressions, influenced by “anchoring bias,” can shape how we perceive subsequent information. Public figures’ actions and statements can set an “anchor” for how specific topics are perceived, potentially skewing public interpretation.\nAdditionally, “confirmation bias,” the tendency to seek out information confirming existing beliefs, can further create echo chambers, limiting exposure to diverse perspectives. This highlights the importance of public figures fostering open and respectful dialogue, promoting understanding, and challenging harmful stereotypes and misinformation.\nBuilding Bridges with Data:\nStatistics paint a powerful picture of public opinion on LGBTQ+ rights and acceptance. Consider these:\n73% of Britons believe same-sex couples deserve equal marriage rights (YouGov poll).\n82% of Britons believe transgender individuals should have the right to live according to their chosen gender identity (Stonewall Report).\nThese figures indicate an apparent disconnect between public opinion and certain narratives amplified within echo chambers. Public figures engaging in behaviour aligning with those narratives can further widen this gap and hinder meaningful dialogue and understanding.\nMoving Forward: A Shared Journey:\nBuilding a more inclusive and compassionate society necessitates fostering respectful dialogue and understanding across diverse groups. Public figures play a crucial role by being mindful of the impact their words and actions can have. They can actively promote understanding by:\nEngaging in open and respectful dialogue: This entails listening actively, seeking diverse perspectives, and promoting civil discourse.\nChallenging harmful stereotypes and misinformation: Combating biases and amplifying accurate information fosters a more inclusive and informed society.\nCreating platforms for diverse voices to be heard: Inclusivity thrives when individuals from various backgrounds and perspectives actively shape public discourse.\nWith over 25 years of dedicated leadership in the corporate, feminist, and LGBTQ+ realms, with a profound commitment to LGBTQ+ and women’s rights, I’m thrilled to be recognised by the British Diversity Awards. I stand ready to support, consult, educate, and advise on your next diversity challenge. Your journey towards inclusivity begins with a conversation.

{"text":"Physical library spaces are designed to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), hence the wide aisles, low checkout stations, and ramps. In contrast, alt tag awareness is low and web accessibility not a priority for most librarians. Yet for visually or otherwise impaired users, an improperly coded website can be like wandering into a maze and hitting a brick wall of frustration.\nWith accessibility in mind, I’ve been teaching myself to assess and retrofit webpages, aligning my library’s website with the W3C’s Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), the U.S. Rehabilitation Act’s Section 508, and this WebAIM Infographic aimed at accessible design as well as code. For best practices, these are your first stops.\nDesign for Users\nCrucially, designing with accessibility in mind makes for websites that are more usable for everyone, not just for disabled users. Questioning trendy design elements can pay off too. Do image-heavy carousels and page-spanning images really enhance UX enough to justify the space they fill and the accessibility problems they may engender?\nOut-of-the-box products may come with their own access problems. WordPress themes often provide low contrast. LibGuides omits the HTML lang attribute on some templates. Developers forget alt tags and form labels. Sometimes it’s easier just to fix stuff yourself.\nAnd I use the word “easier” advisedly. 🙂\nW3C Markup Validator\nFirst, copy and paste your webpage’s URL into the free W3C Markup Validation Service to check the HTML for conformance to W3C web standards. Optimally, your code would be up to HTML5 (and CSS3) standards. This makes for cleaner aesthetics, no deprecated elements, and fewer errors when you run accessibility evaluation tools in the next stages of this process. The Validator will tell you which lines of code need correcting, and lead you to relevant documentation. Once your code is sound (imperfections are ok), break out the WAVE tool.\nPlug in a URL, and the WAVE web accessibility evaluation tool from WebAIM will scan your code, flagging errors, marking structural elements, and alerting you to potential issues. WAVE will flag link texts that say “Click here” or “More,” redundant or empty links, PDFs that may or may not be optimized for accessibility, missing alternative text and form elements, and other problems. WAVE also says what the page does right (for example, WAI-ARIA features, helpful alternative text, and the like).\nBrowser Developer Tools\nTo dig deeper into your code, I suggest using a browser developer tool (Bryan Brown wrote an excellent LITA Blog post on such tools). Google Chrome’s Accessibility Developer Tools are particularly good at auditing for color contrast and recognizable links. Add these to your browser and you can test any page for accessibility and discover exactly what could be improved. Note that these tools can be really nitpicky, and again, functionality rather than perfection is our goal.\nCan you turn off the CSS and still make sense of the page design? Did nothing disappear? Can you manually resize the font to at least 150% without spectacularly messing up the design? Can you navigate using only the keyboard? Are any videos close captioned and any audio files accompanied by transcripts? Can you run pages or sections of pages through a screen reader and still make sense of the content? Try it, and congratulations! You just became a web accessibility guru.\nYou’re not a web developer, you say? Neither am I. But even if your job has nothing to do with digital services, librarians need to know about these technical matters so as to make the case for prioritizing web accessibility and to be able to speak the language of colleagues (often the IT department) who do engage in web development. Web accessibility builds equal access and diverse communities. These are enduring values for librarians, and why I joined the profession.\nWhat about you? How do you “do” web accessibility?","metadata":{"date":1708693795000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947474412.46\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240223121413-20240223151413-00199.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.8876167536,"token_count":864,"url":"https:\/\/litablog.org\/2014\/10\/doing-web-accessibility\/"},"score":3,"id":"83"}
{"text":"Serotonin syndrome, also called serotonin toxicity, is a potentially serious reaction usually caused by medications that increase serotonin. Too much serotonin can negatively affect the brain, muscles, and other parts of the body.\nWhat is serotonin syndrome?\nSerotonin syndrome, also called serotonin toxicity, is a potentially serious drug reaction. It’s believed to occur when too much serotonin builds up in your body. Nerve cells produce serotonin.\nSerotonin is a neurotransmitter, which is a chemical that helps regulate:\n- blood flow\n- body temperature\nIt also plays an important role in the functioning of nerve and brain cells and may impact mood.\nIf you take different prescribed medications together, you may end up with too much serotonin in your body. The types of medication that could lead to serotonin syndrome include those used to treat depression and migraine, and manage pain.\nToo much serotonin can cause a variety of mild to severe symptoms. These symptoms can affect the brain, muscles, and other parts of the body.\nSerotonin syndrome can occur if you take too much medication that boosts serotonin levels.\nIt could happen if:\n- you start a new medication that interferes with serotonin\n- your doctor increases the dosage of a medication you’re already taking\n- you combine two substances that lead to increased serotonin levels, whether medications, supplements, or illegal drugs\nThe condition is most likely to occur when two or more drugs are taken together.\nSerotonin syndrome can be fatal if you do not receive prompt treatment.\nYou may have symptoms within minutes or hours of starting a new medication or having the dosage of an existing medication increased. The symptoms may include:\n- a rapid heart rate\n- muscle rigidity\n- dilated pupils\n- twitching, jerking or muscle spasms\n- a dry mouth and throat\n- flushed skin\n- increased bowel sounds or diarrhea\n- roving eye movements\n- a stretching upward of both big toes on stimulation, known as Babinski sign\nIn more severe cases, symptoms may include:\n- loss of consciousness\nIn severe cases, it can be life threatening.\nSymptoms tend to appear quickly after exposure to a drug. Most people who experience toxicity will develop symptoms within\nFor this reason, it is essential to seek help immediately if anyone shows symptoms that could indicate serotonin syndrome.\nSerotonin syndrome results from the use of drugs, supplements, and other substances.\nIt can happen if you:\n- accidentally use medications that are not suitable or at a dosage that is too high\n- combine two drugs that boost serotonin\n- intentionally take too much of a drug\nTypically, the condition occurs when you combine two or more medications, illegal drugs, or nutritional supplements that increase serotonin levels.\nFor example, you might take medication to help with a migraine after already taking an antidepressant. Some prescription medications, such as opioid pain relievers, may also increase serotonin levels, according to a\nOther examples of drugs and supplements associated with serotonin syndrome include:\nAntidepressants associated with serotonin syndrome include:\n- selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), such as Celexa and Zoloft\n- serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), such as Effexor\n- tricyclic antidepressants, such as nortriptyline and amitriptyline\n- monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), such as Nardil and Marplan\nMigraine medications (triptan category)\nExamples of triptans include:\n- almotriptan (Axert)\n- naratriptan (Amerge)\n- sumatriptan (Imitrex)\nCertain illegal drugs are associated with serotonin syndrome.

Your doctor may begin by reviewing your medical history and symptoms.\nThey will consider:\n- physical symptoms\n- any medication you’re taking\n- any other substances that may contribute to the condition, such as supplements\nBe sure to tell your doctor if you’re taking any medications or have used recreational drugs or supplements in recent weeks. This information can help your doctor make a more accurate diagnosis.\nYour doctor will usually perform several other tests. These will help your doctor find out if certain organs or body functions have been affected. They can also help your doctor rule out other conditions.\nTests your doctor may order include:\n- a complete blood count (CBC)\n- a blood culture\n- thyroid function tests\n- drug screens\n- kidney function tests\n- liver function tests\nSome conditions have similar symptoms to serotonin syndrome. These include:\n- drug overdose\n- hormonal problems\nA condition known as neuroleptic malignant syndrome also has similar symptoms. It’s an adverse reaction to medications used to treat some mental health conditions.\nIf you have a very mild case of serotonin syndrome, your doctor may only advise you to immediately stop taking the medication causing the problem.\nIf you have severe symptoms, you’ll need to go to the hospital. At the hospital, your doctor will closely monitor your condition. You might also receive the following treatments:\n- withdrawal of any medication that caused the condition\n- intravenous fluids for dehydration and fever\n- medications that help relieve muscle stiffness or agitation\n- medications that block serotonin\nIn severe cases, a doctor may recommend using cyproheptadine, which is an antidote.\nIn severe cases, serotonin syndrome\n- rhabdomylosis, in which muscle tissue breaks down, releasing myoglobin, a substance that can damage the kidneys\n- metabolic acidosis\n- kidney failure\n- respiratory failure\n- acute respiratory distress syndrome\n- blood clots\nIn some cases, it can be fatal. If this happens, it is usually within\nThe outlook for serotonin syndrome is good if a person receives a prompt diagnosis and treatment. A person who has no symptoms 6 to 8 hours after exposure is unlikely to experience severe poisoning.\nMost people recover fully and have no further problems once serotonin levels return to normal.\nWhen a fatality occurs, the situation is more likely to have happened with MAOI use than with an SSRI. SSRIs alone are unlikely to cause death, but they can do so if they’re taken alongside another drug or substance.\nYou cannot always prevent serotonin syndrome. Make sure your doctor knows what medications you’re taking. Your doctor should closely monitor you if you’re taking a combination of medications known to increase serotonin levels. This is especially important right after you start a new medication or right after your doctor increases your dosage.\nThe FDA requires warning labels on products to warn people of the risk of serotonin syndrome.\nSerotonin syndrome is a type of poisoning that can occur if a person takes too much of a medication that boosts serotonin levels or if they combine two such drugs. Examples include antidepressant medication, various illegal drugs, and some supplements.\nThe symptoms usually appear quickly. In some cases, they can be life threatening. They include restlessness, twitching, changes in heart rhythm, and so on.\nIf anyone develops symptoms after using drugs that boost serotonin, they or someone else should seek immediate medical help.\nWith prompt treatment, most people make a full recovery.","metadata":{"date":1708587324000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947473735.7\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240222061937-20240222091937-00298.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9126053452,"token_count":1575,"url":"https:\/\/www.healthline.com\/health\/serotonin-syndrome?utm_source=ReadNext"},"score":4,"id":"84"}

{"text":"- Understanding Cloud Migration\n- Understanding Cloud Infrastructure Migration\n- Executing the Migration\n- Challenges and Considerations in Cloud Infrastructure Migration\nCloud migration is a process that involves moving digital business operations into the cloud. This process can be complex and multifaceted, involving various strategies, tools, and considerations. This glossary entry aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of cloud migration, specifically focusing on cloud infrastructure migration.\nCloud infrastructure migration is a subset of cloud migration that specifically deals with moving an organization’s physical or virtual servers to a cloud environment. This process can involve various steps and considerations, including assessing the current infrastructure, planning the migration, executing the migration, and monitoring the new environment.\nUnderstanding Cloud Migration #\nBefore delving into the specifics of cloud infrastructure migration, it’s important to understand the broader concept of cloud migration. Cloud migration is the process of moving data, applications, and other business elements from an organization’s onsite computers to the cloud, or moving them from one cloud environment to another.\nCloud migration is often a strategic move made by organizations to take advantage of the benefits offered by cloud computing. These benefits can include cost savings, increased flexibility, improved collaboration, and access to advanced technologies and services.\nTypes of Cloud Migration #\nThere are several types of cloud migration that an organization might choose to undertake. The choice of migration type will depend on the organization’s specific needs and circumstances. The three main types of cloud migration are public, private, and hybrid.\nPublic cloud migration involves moving data and applications to a cloud environment that is owned and managed by a third-party cloud service provider. Private cloud migration, on the other hand, involves moving data and applications to a cloud environment that is owned and managed by the organization itself. Hybrid cloud migration involves a combination of both, with some data and applications remaining on-premise or in a private cloud, and others being moved to a public cloud.\nCloud Migration Strategies #\nThere are several strategies that an organization might use when undertaking a cloud migration. These strategies, often referred to as the “5 R’s”, include rehosting, replatforming, refactoring, repurchasing, and retiring. Each strategy has its own benefits and considerations, and the choice of strategy will depend on the organization’s specific needs and circumstances.\nRehosting, also known as “lift-and-shift”, involves moving applications and data to the cloud without making any changes. Replatforming involves making some changes to optimize for the cloud, but not changing the core architecture of the application. Refactoring involves re-architecting an application to take full advantage of cloud-native features. Repurchasing involves moving to a different product that’s already cloud-based. Retiring involves getting rid of applications or data that are no longer needed.\nUnderstanding Cloud Infrastructure Migration #\nCloud infrastructure migration is a specific type of cloud migration that involves moving an organization’s physical or virtual servers to a cloud environment. This process can involve various steps and considerations, including assessing the current infrastructure, planning the migration, executing the migration, and monitoring the new environment.\nCloud infrastructure migration can offer several benefits, including cost savings, increased flexibility, and access to advanced technologies and services. However, it can also be a complex and challenging process that requires careful planning and execution.\nAssessing the Current Infrastructure #\nThe first step in a cloud infrastructure migration is to assess the current infrastructure. This involves understanding what servers and applications the organization currently has, how they are used, and what dependencies exist between them. This information is crucial for planning the migration and ensuring that the new environment will meet the organization’s needs.\nAssessing the current infrastructure also involves understanding the organization’s business requirements and objectives. This includes understanding what the organization hopes to achieve through the migration, such as cost savings, increased flexibility, or access to new technologies and services. This information will help guide the migration strategy and decision-making process.\nPlanning the Migration #\nOnce the current infrastructure has been assessed, the next step is to plan the migration. This involves deciding on a migration strategy, choosing a cloud service provider, and designing the new environment. The migration plan should also include a timeline for the migration, a budget, and a plan for managing risks and issues that may arise during the migration.\nPlanning the migration also involves preparing the organization for the change. This can involve training staff, communicating the plan to stakeholders, and setting expectations for the migration process and outcomes. It’s important to ensure that everyone involved understands the plan and is prepared for the migration.\nExecuting the Migration #\nOnce the migration has been planned, the next step is to execute the migration. This involves moving the servers and applications to the new cloud environment, according to the migration plan. This process can be complex and time-consuming, and it’s important to have a clear plan and process in place to manage the migration.\nExecuting the migration also involves testing the new environment to ensure that everything is working as expected. This can involve running tests to check that applications are functioning correctly, that data has been transferred correctly, and that performance is meeting expectations. Any issues that are identified during testing should be addressed before the new environment is put into production.\nMonitoring the New Environment #\nOnce the migration has been executed and the new environment is in production, the final step is to monitor the new environment. This involves keeping an eye on performance, managing any issues that arise, and continually optimizing the environment to meet the organization’s needs.\nMonitoring the new environment also involves measuring the outcomes of the migration. This can involve tracking metrics related to cost savings, performance improvements, and other benefits that the organization hoped to achieve through the migration. This information can be used to evaluate the success of the migration and to inform future migration efforts.\nChallenges and Considerations in Cloud Infrastructure Migration #\nWhile cloud infrastructure migration can offer many benefits, it can also be a complex and challenging process. There are many factors that need to be considered and managed during the migration, including technical challenges, business considerations, and human factors.\nTechnical challenges can include issues related to data transfer, application compatibility, and performance. Business considerations can include issues related to cost, risk, and business continuity. Human factors can include issues related to change management, training, and communication.\nManaging Risks and Issues #\nOne of the key challenges in cloud infrastructure migration is managing risks and issues that arise during the migration. This can involve technical issues, such as data loss or downtime, as well as business issues, such as cost overruns or delays. It’s important to have a clear plan and process in place for managing these risks and issues, to ensure that the migration is successful and that the organization’s business operations are not disrupted.\nManaging risks and issues also involves having a clear understanding of the organization’s risk tolerance and business objectives. This can help guide decision-making during the migration and ensure that risks and issues are managed in a way that aligns with the organization’s goals and priorities.\nEnsuring Business Continuity #\nAnother key consideration in cloud infrastructure migration is ensuring business continuity. This involves ensuring that the organization’s business operations can continue uninterrupted during the migration. This can involve planning for downtime, ensuring that data is backed up and can be recovered if necessary, and having a contingency plan in place in case of unexpected issues.\nEnsuring business continuity also involves communicating with stakeholders, including staff, customers, and partners, about the migration and any potential impacts on business operations. This can help manage expectations and ensure that everyone is prepared for the migration.\nCloud infrastructure migration is a complex process that involves moving an organization’s physical or virtual servers to a cloud environment. This process can offer many benefits, including cost savings, increased flexibility, and access to advanced technologies and services. However, it also involves many challenges and considerations, including technical challenges, business considerations, and human factors.\nDespite these challenges, with careful planning, execution, and monitoring, cloud infrastructure migration can be a successful and beneficial process for many organizations. By understanding the concepts and considerations outlined in this glossary entry, organizations can be better prepared to undertake a cloud infrastructure migration and to reap the benefits of cloud computing.","metadata":{"date":1708659412000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947474360.86\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240223021632-20240223051632-00897.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.946714282,"token_count":1721,"url":"https:\/\/spicule.co.uk\/docs\/cloud-migration-cloud-infrastructure-migration-explained\/"},"score":3,"id":"86"}
{"text":"A fundamental topic of discussion has arisen: the connection between green innovations and economic growth in light of the urgent need for sustainable development and the mounting global environmental issues. In this discussion, we look at how green ideas can help the economy thrive while reducing our impact on the environment. Sustainable solutions are becoming more and more important as the world faces the consequences of climate change and resource loss. The paper explores the interdependent nature of green technologies and economic growth, illuminating how adopting sustainable practices might lead to future resilience and prosperity.\nEnvironmentally Conscious Innovations:\nConcern over the effects of unbridled industrialization and consumerism on the environment has reached critical mass in the twenty-first century. In light of this realization, environmentally friendly innovations have arisen as a symbol of optimism. The goal of these breakthroughs is to lessen the impact that human activities have on the environment. They range from renewable energy technology to environmentally friendly production techniques. Green technologies are crucial because they may promote economic growth while also addressing pressing challenges like pollution, climate change, and biodiversity loss.\nEnvironmentally Friendly Advancements and the Generation of New Jobs:\nA lot of people think that becoming green will slow down the economy, but in reality, green advancements have actually helped to create more jobs. Competent labor is essential for creating, deploying, and maintaining environmentally friendly technology as we move toward a green economy. Possibilities for employment in renewable energy, waste management, and sustainable agriculture are expanding as a result of industry-wide shifts toward more environmentally friendly practices. Developing a trained and versatile workforce is just one of the many benefits of green technology, which also generate job opportunities.\nRenewable Energy Technology Advancements:\nImproved methods of producing energy from renewable sources are a bedrock of environmentally friendly developments. Both environmental degradation and economic susceptibility to oil price swings can be traced back to conventional wisdom’s reliance on fossil fuels. Reducing carbon emissions and improving energy security are two benefits of shifting to renewable energy sources like solar, wind, and hydropower. By putting money into renewable energy infrastructure, countries may help achieve global sustainability goals and get a head start in the growing green economy.\nSustainable Production and the Circular Economy:\nA circular economy is becoming more popular as a means to an end in the fight for long-term sustainability. By reusing, recycling, and regenerating resources, a circular economy aims to minimize waste, in contrast to the linear “take-make-dispose” paradigm. In order to maximize efficiency while decreasing environmental effect, green innovations in sustainable manufacturing processes use this circular strategy. In addition to helping the environment, businesses that embrace the circular economy principles strengthen the economy by making resources more resistant to disruption, which bodes well for the future.\nSustainable Urbanization and Smart Cities:\nThere are possibilities and threats to sustainable development brought about by the fast rate of urbanization. Smart cities, which use technology to increase efficiency, decrease energy consumption, and improve people’s quality of life, rely heavily on green advancements. By utilizing intelligent transportation systems and energy-efficient buildings, smart cities are able to create economically thriving and environmentally sustainable urban environments. A more balanced relationship between cities and their natural surroundings can be achieved through the use of green technology in city planning.\nSustainable Investment and Finance:\nIt will be necessary to spend heavily in environmentally friendly technologies and practices in order to make the shift to a sustainable future. A significant enabler of green technologies, green finance entails directing funding towards projects that are environmentally friendly. Aligning financial resources with sustainability goals is becoming more important for governments, corporations, and financial institutions. The financial industry is vital in channeling funds towards projects that foster economic development and environmental preservation, through green bonds and sustainable investment portfolios.\nPossibilities and Obstacles:\nThe road to a sustainable future is not without its obstacles, but the advantages of environmentally friendly advancements are enormous. The necessity for worldwide cooperation, policy vacuums, and technology obstacles all fall under this category of difficulties. Nevertheless, there is a chance for creativity, teamwork, and preparation for the future in every obstacle. Societies may realize the full promise of green innovations if they overcome these obstacles, and in the future, sustainable economic growth will be associated with environmental sustainability.\nThe union of environmentally friendly advances with economic growth is a ray of hope in the quest for a sustainable future. Environmental preservation and economic growth are no longer seen as mutually exclusive due to the interconnectedness of these two ideas. At this juncture in history, decisions taken now will have far-reaching consequences for decades to come. A robust and thriving global economy can be fostered through the adoption of green innovations, which also help to reduce the effects of climate change. If we want to live in peace with the Earth, we must adopt sustainable methods; doing otherwise is not even a choice.","metadata":{"date":1709222882000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947474843.87\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240229134901-20240229164901-00598.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9258687496,"token_count":987,"url":"http:\/\/luhla.com\/2023\/12\/14\/green-innovations-and-economic-growth-a-sustainable-future\/"},"score":3,"id":"87"}

{"text":"The Salt Lake City area frequently sees summer tropospheric ozone (O3) concentrations that exceed the EPA's standards for \"healthy\" air quality. O3 is a main component of photochemical smog and can cause inflammation of the lungs, difficulty breathing and increased risk of asthma attacks, bronchitis, and lung infections. Salt Lake City lies near a major mining facility, U.S. Magnesium, that produces of 14% of the world's magnesium for use in metal alloys, batteries, and bombs. This facility emits reactive halogen gases as a by-product of their mining process and is the largest point source of reactive halogen gases in the U.S. The complex role that halogen chemistry plays in the production of tropospheric O3 is not well understood. Therefore, understanding the impact of these halogen emissions on summertime O3 formation is critical in designing effective air quality management strategies in Salt Lake City. It's been well established that O3 is produced in the atmosphere through a complex series of reactions involving the oxidation of Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) in the presence of Nitrogen Oxides (NOx). The presence of halogens can lead to an increase in O3 concentrations by increasing downwind NOx and oxidant concentrations (as it does in the wintertime in Salt Lake City) or lead to a decrease in O3 production through catalytic loss cycles (as it does in the stratosphere). In this work, we use NOx, O3, and VOC data collected at Hawthorne Elementary in downtown Salt Lake City as input to an explicit box model containing >15,000 reactions, the Framework for 0-D Atmospheric Modeling (F0AM), to compare predicted O3 concentrations with and without halogens. We find that model predictions of O3 in the region are sensitive to unmeasured reactive halogen concentrations and unmeasured secondarily produced semi-volatile VOC concentrations. Our results underscore the need for better local constraints to decrease uncertainty in predictions of O3 concentrations under future potential emissions scenarios.","metadata":{"date":1708639781000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947473824.45\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240222193722-20240222223722-00699.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9176369309,"token_count":421,"url":"https:\/\/our.utah.edu\/urs\/understanding-the-impact-of-halogens-on-tropospheric-ozone-concentrations-in-salt-lake-city\/"},"score":4,"id":"91"}
{"text":"Hey all you Radio KRUD fans (if such a thing exists anymore)! Rival Dave is back from a hefty hiatus. I’ll have to admit that I got really bored with the whole format of the thing, which is why I couldn’t bring myself to update for so long. I’m going\nto try and change up my writing style a bit so I can rediscover what I originally loved about the whole KRUD thing and avoid falling into that rut again.\nSo to start with, I guess I should get to a band that quickly became a personal favorite of mine after they submitted music to me a few years ago: The Passive Aggressives. Not only are they an incredibly talented group with a unique sound, but I feel like I owe a debt to them. When they sent me a second album to review, I found the standard promotional material slipped inside the CD case, but wasn’t I surprised when my previous post about the band was quoted alongside reviews from magazines and other more traditional media outlets.\nWith flattery like that, I feel guilty for getting to their album Conflict Resolution practically two years after it was released. At least I can hope that that any hype, no matter when it comes out, is always beneficial. And, like I said, I owe the band for thinking enough of my post to quote it in their promo material.\nSo here we go…\nThe Passive Aggressives: Jose Santiago (Vocals, Guitars, and Percussion), Keren Gaiser (Lead Vocals, Percussion, and Keyboards), Damian Lynch (Vocals, Bass, Ukulele, and Percussion), and Tim Dayner (Vocals, Drums, and Percussion)\nFirst of all, let me say that The Passive Aggressives seem to have come a long way in such a short amount of time between their self-titled EP and Conflict Resolution. They, of course, still have that heavy-hitting, crunchy, and bass-laden sound they established in their EP, which is evident in songs like “Soundtrack to the Voices in My Head.” I’m actually listening to Conflict Resolution on my PS3 as I write this post (my PC isn’t putting out good sound write now, so my PS3 is my best bet for good sound output), and when I looked back to the TV as that track started, the visualizer was of a hilly landscape rushing towards the screen. It was a strangely appropriate image what with the fast pace of the song, the deep, pounding drums, the motor-like buzz of the guitars, and the frantic, sometimes snarling, vocals. It’s not hard to imagine yourself jetting down a long stretch of highway, watching the scenery fly by with “Soundtrack to the Voices in My Head” blasting out of speakers.\nBut The Passive Aggressives have also shown with Conflict Resolution that they are capable of producing soft, emotional songs that rock just as hard, such as “Slice It Away.” This is one of those songs where it’s hard to tell exactly what message or story the lyrics are supposed to convey, which is a good thing. The lyrics are clever, emotionally evocative, and they leave the listener thinking and coming up with their own interpretation. The beginning line, “I open up my eyes to find pills at my fingertips,” along with lines like, “This present situation is mostly self-inflicted,” and, “Head that’s been aching for days, so much that I can’t see straight,” would make one think that this is just a song about struggling with drug addiction. Then there are lines about “flashing headlights,” “traffic copters circling,” and “floating through a spiderweb of shattering glass,” which is a really clever image, by the way. So did the person in this song just get into a car crash and fly through their windshield as a result of drugs and alcohol? I’m guessing so. But no matter what your interpretation is, it’s a great song that you will want to listen to several times over.\nThen there’s weirder songs like “Lulla-Bye Nation,” which kinda sounds like… well, a lullabye. I don’t know who of you will recognize this other song, but it reminded me of “Darlin’ Ukulele” by Jolie Holland since they’re both catchy, simple little tunes with minimal instrumentation (i.e. a ukulele and a xylophone). “Lulla-Bye Nation” sort of digresses from the sound and style of the rest of the album, but The Passive Aggressives are by no means a traditional rock band, so it’s a strange fit with the inherent weirdness of The Passive Aggressives (not that weirdness is a bad thing, mind you).\nSpeaking of weirdness, The Passive Aggressives even do a cover of “Happy Together” by The Turtles. I’ll admit that when I first heard this song, or when I first hear most covers for that matter, I was immediately dismissive. “What the hell have they done to this classic pop song?” That’s what I thought to myself. But eventually I had to realize that there’s nothing wrong with a unique interpretation of a song, no matter how thoroughly it’s ingrained into our cultural unconsciousness. What’s especially unique about this cover are the odd vocal harmonies. Keren Gaiser takes the lead with her sultry singing and one of the other members (I honestly don’t know which one) harmonizes in a deep, breathy voice. The contrast between the two vocals is so great that it puts you off at first, but they end up working really well together once you get into the song. Add onto that strange vocal mix some grinding guitars, a thumpy, funky bass, and a trippy guitar solo and you get a cover of “Happy Together” unlike any other you’ve heard before.\nSo to summarize Conflict Resolution and The Passive Aggressives as a whole: funky, crunchy, thumpin’, bumpin’, sometimes mellow, always rockin’, and definitely weird, but weird in the best way possible.\nWell, that’s about it for this post. Hopefully, I can keep up with a decent pace with the posts in the future. Keep reading and providing feedback.\nBuy Conflict Resolution at CD Baby,\nAmazon, or iTunes.\nThe Passive Aggressives – Soundtrack to the Voices in My Head\nThe Passive Aggressives – Happy Together\nThe Passive Aggressives – Slice It Away\nThe Passive Aggressives – Lulla-Bye Nation","metadata":{"date":1709447541000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947476205.65\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240303043351-20240303073351-00899.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9563946724,"token_count":1457,"url":"https:\/\/radiokrud.com\/2010\/02\/26\/conflict-resolution-finally\/"},"score":1,"id":"92"}
{"text":"1. What is Logistics and Supply Chain Management?\nLogistics typically refers to activities that occur within the boundaries of a single organization and Supply Chain refers to networks of companies that work together and coordinate their actions to deliver a product to market.\nAlso, traditional logistics focuses its attention on activities such as procurement, distribution, maintenance, and inventory management.\nUnderstanding logistics entails an understanding of the basics of supply chain management. Supply Chain Management (SCM) acknowledges all of traditional logistics and also includes activities such as marketing, new product development, finance, and customer service.\n2. What is Logistics?\nLogistics is about getting the right product, to the right customer, in the right quantity, in the right condition, at the right place, at the right time, and at the right cost (the seven Rs of Logistics)” .\nIn the past, various logistics tasks were under different departments, but now they are under “logistics department” and report to the same logistics head\nWe would like to point out that the word “logistics” ends with the “s”. Without the “s” (logistic), it means a kind of mathematical function showing exponential growth.\n3. What is Logistics Management?\nLogistics Management deals with the efficient and effective management of day-to-day activity in producing the company’s finished goods and services.\nThe basics of logistics management include understanding the basics of supply chain management, warehousing, transportation and managing inventories.\n4. What is the Difference between Inbound and Outbound Logistics?\nInbound Logistics refers to the movement of goods and raw materials from suppliers to your company. In contrast,\nOutbound Logistics refers to the movement of finished goods from your company to customers.\nTo illustrate this term, we make a small graphic as below:\nAs you can see above, purchasing and warehouse function communicates with suppliers and is sometimes called “supplier facing function”. Production planning and inventory control function is the center point of this chart. Customer service and transport function communicate with customers and are sometimes called “customer facing functions”.\n5. What is Transport and Logistics?\nTransport and Logistics refers to 2 types of activities, namely, transportation (traditional services such as air\/sea\/land transportation, warehousing, customs clearance) and logistics (value-added services which including information technology and consulting)\n6. What is International Logistics and Global Logistics?\nInternational logistics, global logistics and global supply chain are one of the most ambiguous groups of terms out there. They are used interchangeably and often referred to international production and transportation activities. However, the most concise definition of international logistics or global logistics is as below.\n“International Logistics (also known as Global Logistics) focuses on how to manage and control overseas activities effectively as a single business unit. Therefore, companies should try to harness the value of overseas product, services, marketing, R&D and turn them into competitive advantage”\n7. What is 3PL or Third Party Logistics?\nThe concept of Third Party Logistics or 3PL appeared on the scene in the 1980s as the way to reduce costs and improve services which can be defined as below:\n“3PL or Third Party Logistics refers to the outsourcing of logistics activities, ranging from a specific task, such as trucking or marine cargo transport to broader activities serving the whole supply chain such as inventory management, order processing and consulting.”\nIn the past, many 3PL providers didn’t have adequate expertise to operate in complex supply chain structure and process. The result was the inception of another concept.\n8. What is 4PL or Fourth Party Logistics?\nFourth Party Logistics or 4PL is the concept proposed by Accenture Ltd in 1996 and it was defined as below,\n“4PL or Fourth Party Logistics refers to a party who works on behalf of the client to do contract negotiations and management of performance of 3PL providers, including the design of the whole supply chain network and control of day-to-day operations”\nTop 3 reasons why customers would like to use 4PL providers according to the research by Nezar Al-Mugren, are as below:\n– Lack of technology to integrate supply chain processes\n– The increase in operating complexities\n– The sharp increase in global business operations.\n9. What is Supply Chain?\n“Supply Chain is the network of organizations that are involved, through upstream and downstream linkages, in the different processes and activities that produce value in the form of products and services in the hands of the ultimate consumer” – from Logistics and Supply Chain Management by Martin Christopher.\n10. What is Supply Chain Management?\nEach researcher defines supply chain management differently. However, we would like to provide the simple supply chain management definition as below,\n“Supply Chain Management (SCM) refers to the coordination of production, inventory, location, and transportation among the participants in a supply chain to achieve the best mix of responsiveness and efficiency for the market being served” – from Essential of Supply Chain Management by Michael Hugos\nWhat does a logistics and supply chain management course entail?\nThe coursework in a logistics and supply chain management program will cover topics such as introduction to logistics and supply chain management, procurement, inventory control, warehousing, transportation, customer service, and global supply chain management.\nStudents will learn how to apply various analytical tools and methods to solve problems in logistics and supply chain management. In addition, they will also get a chance to develop their negotiation, leadership, and communication skills.\nGraduates of a logistics and supply chain management program can find employment in a variety of industries such as manufacturing, retail, transportation, warehousing, and logistics. They can work in positions such as supply chain analyst, purchasing manager, logistics manager, transportation manager, and customer service manager.","metadata":{"date":1709134632000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947474737.17\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240228143955-20240228173955-00897.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9576942325,"token_count":1230,"url":"https:\/\/clariongr.com\/10-basics-of-logistics-and-supply-chain-management-you-should-know\/"},"score":4,"id":"93"}
{"text":"Humoresques Op. 101 (1894)\nFrom 1892 to 1985, Dvorak held the post of Director of the National Conservatory in NewYork. During this time, he penned down many thematic notes in his sketch books, whicj were later to be used in various compositions. While in holiday in the summer of 1894, in his beloved summer home in Vysoká in Bohemia, he worked out some of these sketches into a cycle of 8 piano pieces. Initially, the cycle had no title yet. The composer considered naming them \"New Scotch Dances\" (after an earlier set of Ecossaises he wrote) but eventually settled for the title Humoresques. They were published as Op.101 in August of the same year by his Berlin publisher Simrock.\nThese delightful miniatures show Dvorak's ever-fresh inspiration at its best, and are notable for the influences of his 'American' period (for example, the theme of the fourth Humoresque was described by the composer as \"Hiawatha's child theme\", destined for an opera on that was never to materialize). The mood varies between gentle melancholy and blissful contentedness.\nThe seventh Humoresque in G Flat Major has become one of the most popular classical pieces in existence, and the publisher Simrock made vast amounts of money on it by publishing it separately in arrangements for all possible and impossible instruments and ensembles, even, in the U.S.A., in a version for choir.\n|Humoresque No.7 in G flat major","metadata":{"date":1708956763000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947474660.32\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240226130305-20240226160305-00399.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9764364362,"token_count":325,"url":"http:\/\/www.pianosociety.com\/pages\/dvorak_humoreques\/"},"score":3,"id":"94"}

{"text":"In a case report released on 21 September 2020, the German Foundation Central Agency Packaging Register (ZSVR) describes the case involving an IT system house.\nEvidently a large group of affiliated IT trading companies with their own direct (IT system house) sales organisation has failed to meet its product responsibility for packaging and has been violating its obligations under packaging law for years now. The companies are manufacturers of a substantial volume of packaging subject to mandatory system participation. They fill their packaging items with goods and place them on the market. The companies in question thus are manufacturers\/first distributors under the Packaging Act for the relevant sales, repackaging and, in particular, packaging for shipment. By failing to participate in the system, the companies have gained unjustified competitive advantages over competitors who have behaved in conformity with the law.\nThe group of companies has evidently been practising this for years despite having its own legal department, compliance officer and, contrary to the appearance of product responsibility being created by publishing a number of sustainability reports. Sales-, repackaging and shipment packaging of information technology equipment (e.g. screens, keyboards, mouse-like pointing devices, printers, notebook computers, desktop PCs, servers, storage units such as hard disks, memory cards, USB sticks) is predominantly collected by far from private end consumers comparable sources (such as administrations, public authorities and offices of large commercial enterprises) as contemplated by Section 3 (11) of the German Packaging Act. Accordingly, they are almost without exception obliged to participate in the system provided under the Packaging Act.\nAs manufacturers within the meaning of the Packaging Act, the companies only registered in the LUCID packaging register after the ZSVR notified them of their unlawful omission. In response to the notice by the ZSVR, the companies have subsequently registered in the LUCID packaging register. However, manufacturers of packaging subject to mandatory system participation must register before placing such articles on the market; cf. Section 9 of the Packaging Act.\nFor years, the companies have not participated in one or more systems for their packaging quantities, thus violating Sections 6 respectively 7 of the Packaging Act. There are concrete indications of administrative offences having been committed. These can be punished for each offence with a fine of up to 100,000 euros under the Packaging Ordinance or 200,000 euros under the Packaging Act.\nFailing system participation regarding the quantities of packaging, and since 2019 also failing registration, the companies should not have placed their packaging on the market; cf. Section 6 (1), sentence 3 of the Packaging Ordinance as well as Section 7 (1), sentence 4 and Section 9 (5) sentence 1 of the Packaging Act. There are concrete indications of administrative offences having been committed. These may be punished for each offence with a fine of up to 100,000 euros.\nThe ZSVR has notified the competent state enforcement authority that there are concrete indications of regulatory offences having been committed. Possible consequence of such administrative offences provide for the imposition of fines including profit skimming as well as the monitoring of mandatory system participation for past periods. To the extent that registration and system participation per company is not yet fully in place, a distribution ban on packaging subject to system participation likewise applies by law. The ZVSR will examine whether the registered companies comply with their further obligations regarding system participation and data reporting and, if applicable, the depositing of declarations of completeness. The ZSVR or the competent federal state authority may also demand at any time that a declaration of completeness be deposited in the LUCID packaging register, even if the values fall below the defined thresholds.\nIf you have any questions on the Packaging Act as well as mandatory system participation, please do not hesitate to contact the take-e-way consultants by calling +49\/40\/750687-0 or sending an e-mail to firstname.lastname@example.org.","metadata":{"date":1708589896000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947473735.7\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240222061937-20240222091937-00299.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9549947977,"token_count":801,"url":"https:\/\/www.take-e-way.com\/news\/it-system-house-faces-sanctions-for-failure-to-comply-with-system-participation-obligation\/"},"score":2,"id":"96"}
{"text":"What is epilepsy?\nEpilepsy is a name for a condition that causes brief disturbances in the normal electric function of the brain. These disturbances are called seizures. Another name for epilepsy is “seizure disorder.” In someone who has epilepsy, the normal activity in the brain is interrupted by bursts of activity that are more intense than usual. These bursts may cause symptoms that no one else is aware of, like a strange feeling in the body or a certain taste, smell or sight. At other times, the symptoms may be visible, like loss of consciousness (“blacking out”) or body movements that can't be controlled (“convulsions”). When the activity in the brain causes any of these symptoms, the person is said to be having a seizure.\nWhat is the difference between epilepsy and seizures?\nSeizures are the events caused by the short disruption of the brain's normal activity. They are a sign of epilepsy. Epilepsy is the underlying tendency of the brain to produce seizures. Sometimes a person will have a seizure if the brain gets irritated—such as from a fever or a medicine side effect. This kind of seizure doesn't necessarily mean the person has epilepsy. A person has epilepsy when the brain's activity is disrupted and seizures happen over and over again.\nAre seizures dangerous?\nSome seizures, especially those that cause a person to lose consciousness or to fall down, can cause injuries. Although life-threatening complications from a seizure are rare, people who have repeated seizures are at risk for serious complications. So it's best for people with epilepsy to have treatment to prevent seizures from happening.\nWhat causes epilepsy?\nEpilepsy can have many causes. These include serious head injuries, the after-effects of an infection, problems in the way the brain developed before birth, and genetic (inherited) conditions. Many people with epilepsy haven't had a brain injury. Often, no cause for epilepsy can be found.\nIf I have epilepsy, will my children have it, too?\nSome kinds of epilepsy run in families, but many kinds don't. Most children whose parents have epilepsy don't get it themselves. Your doctor can tell you what kind of epilepsy you have and if it might run in your family.\nHow does the doctor know I have epilepsy?\nYour doctor will ask questions that will help him or her tell if you have epilepsy. Tests like the electroencephalogram (EEG) and brain scans may also give helpful information. The EEG is a test that records the electric activity of the brain. The brain waves that happen during or even between seizures may show certain patterns that help your doctor decide if you have epilepsy. Brain scans, like computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), provide a picture of your brain. The scans may show a scar, a growth or another condition that could be causing epilepsy.\nHow is epilepsy treated?\nMany medicines may be used in patients with epilepsy to stop seizures from occurring and to reduce the frequency or severity of seizures. In many patients with epilepsy, medicine completely controls seizures—that is, the person doesn't have any seizures while taking the medicine. In other patients, seizures are harder to control. Several medicines may need to be tried before the best one is found. Some patients have side effects from one medicine and have to try another one. In some patients, the seizures aren't completely stopped by medicine. These patients may be referred to doctors who are epilepsy specialists. They can often offer other treatments for epilepsy, including surgery.\nHow can I help control my seizures?\nWork closely with your doctor. Take your medicine as instructed. Help your doctor to know if the medicine is working for you by keeping track of any seizures or side effects in a diary or on a calendar. Try to have a regular sleep schedule. Changes in your sleep pattern might make seizures more likely. Avoid drinking alcohol, especially if it tends to provoke your seizures.\nWhere can I find out more about epilepsy?\nA great place for information on epilepsy is the Epilepsy Foundation of America. They can send you a catalog of publications about epilepsy and offer other assistance. You can telephone toll-free by calling 1-800-EFA-1000. An Internet Web site on epilepsy is available at www.efa.org.","metadata":{"date":1708470686000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947473347.0\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240220211055-20240221001055-00299.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9447550178,"token_count":885,"url":"https:\/\/www.aafp.org\/pubs\/afp\/issues\/1998\/0401\/p1603.html"},"score":4,"id":"97"}
{"text":"The holidays are here and many people are making plans for family gatherings. For some, these gatherings will take them home for family reunions, formal or informal. We have become such a far-flung society, that it is only at vacation and holiday times that we often get to see some of the family.\nOf course, for those who are just beginning to get involved in genealogical research, this is the ideal time to see what the family may remember. Of course, you can't just show up on someone's doorstep and start quizzing them. If you cannot contact them ahead of time, you need to have a plan for the types of questions you are going to ask.\nHolidays offer a way to get family info.\nName, Rank and Serial Number\nFrom experience, asking them when great grandpa Ted was born is not the most effective method. Invariably, they will shake their head and tell you they just don't remember. Instead of asking such direct questions, you will want to ask them about things they will remember. Ask them about going to school or holiday celebrations. Ask them about their first car or about when they moved into a house or to the farm.\nThese are the types of events that people remember. While they are telling these stories you can interject questions about how old they were then or if great grandpa Ted was there for that Christmas or birthday and if so how old was he.\nWithout their realizing, as they answer your questions, they will be supplying you with the information you need to those drier questions, such as just when was great grandpa Ted born. When put in the context of their life, they have something to pull out of their memory, and it will make a difference in the information they share.\nWorking with the Information\nArmed with this information, you can then begin to create a timeline that will hold the clues to approximate dates of birth and marriage and death for many of the family members. This gives you the starting point for your genealogy. At this point you can begin to see what record types might be of use to you.\nOnce you have the timeline, you can begin to put the pieces together in your genealogy software. Then as you get records that verify this information, you can include the source citations in your database. And before you know it you will be a full-fledged genealogist, complete with the database back six or more generations.\nDon't Let the Chance Slip By\nIf you are going to see the family over the holidays, don't let the opportunity get away from you to talk with them. You never know when it will be your last. We always think we have unlimited time and before you know it, you find yourself the oldest living relative with many regrets.\nSome of my fondest memories are of sitting at the table talking with my grandfather about his first job, and when he and my grandmother were first married. Pictures that he showed me had a story. They stopped being two-dimensional and came alive. And while I didn't get to videotape these times, I have my notes and hopefully my memories for time to come and I have the pictures as well.\nGetting started with genealogy need not be overwhelming. Talking with family is the best way to begin. And if you jump right into the records sometimes you don't get around to talking to the family until much later. Sometimes you miss out that way. Don't let it happen to you.\nRhonda R. McClure is a professional genealogist specializing in celebrity trees and computerized genealogy. She has been involved in online genealogy for fifteen years.

{"text":"Polyimides by nature are highly resistive materials which exhibit exceptional thermal and chemical stabilities. Yet, there are a number of instances in which a polymeric material displaying low resistance and featuring similar physical, chemical, and thermal characteristics as polyimide would be desirable. Toward this goal, multilayered polyimide composite films have been produced through the homogeneous incorporation of copper salts and complexes into poly(amide acid) followed by thermal processing. In this way, highly anisotropic copper containing composite films have been obtained which feature a surface or near-surface layer of copper metal or copper oxide as the conductive medium.\nThe surface resistivity of the composites is lowered up to ten orders of magnitude relative to unmodified polyimide films. However, in many cases, the discontinuity of the copper containing layer limits the attainment of near-theoretical resistivity. Hence, evaluation of the composites by a variety of analytical techniques have been used to develop structure-process-property relationships in order to optimize the electrical properties of these materials.\nThe surface treatment of polymeric materials by glow discharge is known to improve their adhesive strength when in contact with a large number of other substances, be they polymeric, metallic, or ceramic in nature. Many efforts have been made to characterize this phenomenon, however in most instances, details concerning the interfacial structure and adhesion mechanism are not fully understood.\nThe second part of this Dissertation describes the structure and chemistry occurring in the interfacial region between sputter-coated titanium metal, and both plasma pretreated and nonpretreated polyethylene terephthalate (PET) film. The effect of plasma pretreatment on nonmetallized PET is discussed as well. Upon application of a gaseous plasma, titanium\/polyester adhesion increases dramatically following metallization compared to the nonpretreated analog. In order to relate this phenomenon to a physical and\/or chemical change X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Auger electron spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, as well as, surface Fourier transform infrared spectrometry have been used to characterize both the surface and interfacial regions of these films.","metadata":{"date":1709236354000,"dump":"CC-MAIN-2024-10","file_path":"s3:\/\/commoncrawl\/crawl-data\/CC-MAIN-2024-10\/segments\/1707947474852.83\/warc\/CC-MAIN-20240229170737-20240229200737-00698.warc.gz","language":"en","language_score":0.9095828533,"token_count":445,"url":"https:\/\/vtechworks.lib.vt.edu\/items\/8a01acad-cfe5-43c1-b91d-9dc1c9e2b26b"},"score":3,"id":"99"}
